reminding us tonight of much of this unfinished business of our great country and laying out the glaring disparities that were witnessing in the african american community but also what our economic empowerment agenda is of the congressional black caucus so thank you congresswoman tubbs jones millions of americans are one paycheck that is if they have a paycheck away from poverty now the numbers speak for themselves gas prices are at record levels averaging in my district 3 73 a gallon even as oil is traded at over 100 a barrel and big oil companies are reaping in record profits foreclosures have skyrocketed putting hundreds of thousands of people out on the street the american dream of homeownership is quickly turning into a nightmare for many hardworking individuals and families in our country in my district in alameda county we are projected to lose nearly 4 700 homes to foreclosures due to the subprime mortgage crisis eliminating 3 2 billion in home equity value thats equal to a drop in home equity by almost 8 500 for each homeowner in my district meanwhile food prices have risen squeezing recipients of food stamps even as the number of people expected to enroll in the program will reach a record 28 million people in the next fiscal year health care costs are going through the roof even as this administration is posing massive cuts in funding for medicare and l4dicaid and african americans continue to be the hardest hit as of february 2008 the unemployment rate for african americans was over 8 3 percent nearly double the national average of 4 3 percent among the african american community poverty rates are 2 5 times higher than the national average even more disturbing almost 40 percent of african american children under 5 years of age live in poverty and all the while african americans continue to be the target for as we talked about earlier subprime loans african americans are three times more likely to have a subprime loan than whites accounting for 52 percent of all subprime loans and as the housing market has collapsed estimates indicate that african americans alone will lose between 164 to 213 billion in home equity value during this recession its long past time for congress to address the burden of this economic downturn on the african american community and other communities of color and address the ongoing lack of opportunity in minority communities in america even in the face of this massive housing crisis and impending recession growing unemployment and the highest number of applicants for food stamps since the programs inception the bush administration wants to cut funding mind you cut funding for the most vital programs so that he can continue to fund his failed occupation in iraq this is partly due to iraq billions of dollars that have beenspent this economic downturn i personally call this the iraq recession at nearly half a trillion dollars the occupation of iraq and the resulting iraq recession has wasted too much of american treasure drained too much of our american resources and most importantly claimed too many american lives and we cannot dismiss the toll that this occupation has had on the economic security of our nation and on the average american family who will feel the impact of these expenses for years to come the joint economic committee estimates the total bill for the war through 2008 will cost the typical family of four a full 16 500 can you imagine what a family of four can do with 16 500 this conflict has claimed the lives of more than 4 000 brave members of our armed forces and has resulted in injuries to more than 28 000 others five years after the invasion and occupation of iraq 47 million americans are living without health insurance 47 million and more than 36 million people continue to live in poverty at least 2 million of which have fallen into poverty since 2003 five years later it is projected that more than 2 million american families will lose their homes to foreclosure primarily over the next 2 years and worse as the demand is increasing for programs serving children the elderly and the poor and those facing the loss of their income more than half of our states face serious budget shortfalls that will force them to cut back or even eliminate programs that serve the most vulnerable of our populations so we must address the needs and the will of our country by bringing an end to this occupation and to the immeasurable costs that will continue to be exacted on the physical and economic security of the american people for generations to come fortyone years ago dr martin luther king was as he said compelled to see the war as the enemy of the poor and attack it as such of course dr king was referring to the vietnam war but his understanding of the relationship between the vast sums spent dropping bombs in a foreign country and the resulting lack of funding for programs that relieve hunger and poverty are just as true today as they were back then especially now with this economic downturn a recent survey revealed that 68 percent of americans believe that ending the war and occupation in iraq is an important step the unitedstates government must take to respond to the current economic recession so we must put an end to this occupation and we must fund a real economic stimulus plan that expands unemployment assistance and food stamp benefits provides housing assistance and foreclosure relief for homeowners and expands medicaid payments to states through the federal medical assistance percentage we need to pass a real bankruptcy reform bill i believe this one that were working on now is h r 3609 its called the emergency home ownership and mortgage equity protection act of 2007 that will give struggling homeowners a fighting chance to stay in their homes weve got to reauthorize and realize that hope vi is an important important housing initiative and pass h r 3524 to finally stop putting an end to predatory lending and instead of spending billions to bail out bear stearns we should really be investing that money to train our workforce and to expand green jobs and eradicate poverty so as we remember 3 years ago hurricane katrina served as a real rude wake up call to the nation and the continuing inequality that plagues minority communities especially the african communities in america katrina opened the eyes of many americans about the continuing burden of poverty that often isolates and traps generations of americans of color african americans in a cycle of poverty and disenfranchisement so we cannot ignore the legacy of katrina nor can we ignore the legacy of dr kings words so this week as we approach the 40th anniversary of dr kings assassination let us all make a commitment to honor his vision and his lifes work we must end this occupation of iraq and we must enact a real economic stimulus plan so that the american people can move forward take care of their families come out of this downturn and really begin to live the type of life the quality of life that they so deserve in the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world thank you congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones for giving us the opportunity tonight to talk about the real suffering that people are feeling but giving people some hope that there are many here in washington d

do it passed the largest tax increase in american history thats not what we say thats what the congressional budget office says our scorekeepers so what did they do in conference they decided to accede to the senate and have a slightly smaller tax increase they started off with the red line largest tax increase in american history as measured by the congressional budget office no matter what you say the numbers in the budget just dont lie then they said lets have a trigger if we dont spend too much money and if the surplus is big enough in 2010 then maybe some taxpayers could get some tax relief and we wont raise all of their taxes we will extend the marriage penalty and the child tax credit 10 percent bracket but will all the other tax increases occur so we will have the second highest tax increase in american history thats what their proposal does they simply cannot have it both ways they cannot say there is no tax increase in this budget and then say we are preserving some

spending then they have a 217 billion tax increase then they have 23 reserve funds 23 wish lists which equal 190 billion in new spending then they have no entitlement reforms which means our

another 190 billion tax increase to pay for it a vicious cycle of new spending the trigger tax says we would like to give some people some tax relief but if we continue to whet our appetite taxpayers wont get it all this trigger says is it puts the taxpayer at the back of the line and the government and spending at the front of line we have a different core set of values we believe the money that people make is their money not the governments money if you are making money working hard and paying taxes thats your money not ours we have a different set of beliefs they believe the opposite they believe that more and more and more money ought to come out of workers paychecks they believe that they can spend your money better than you can that is not what we believe the reason that we dont

undiagnosed illnesses the congress must say no and override his veto thursday so that our children have access to regular checkups preventative care and a primary physician we must stand with the american people who overwhelmingly support increasing access to childrens health care we must stand with nearly every single health organization every single childrens organization in america like the american medical association the american academy of pediatrics the childrens defense fund easter seals the march of dimes and countless others who support their bill because they all understand the devastating impact of being uninsured we must stand with the largest health insurance trade association in the country americas health insurance plans who praised expanding the state childrens health insurance program as a vital step in ensuring the health security of millions of americas children sadly i believe like many of us believe that the president is totally disconnected from the reality of our childrens lives he has asked congress for another 190 billion 190 billion to fund his occupation of iraq while he has vetoed a fraction of that amount for our children this is a shortsighted assault on our nations children and we cannot stand for it this program is one of the most successful programs in the nation and it should be reauthorized and it should be expanded when i was a state senator in california i helped write the california state program called healthy families and now healthy families provides lowcost access to health care for over 800 000 children more than any other

conference report shall be considered as read the rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee on the budget budgets are moral documents they are more than just an accounting of expenditures and revenue they are statements of our national values and priorities for too long congress passed budgets with the wrong priorities for too long the budget put the interests of the powerful before the needs of working families and those going through hard times and for too long the budgets of the past pretended that people who were struggling didnt even exist let alone matter that has changed now this congress the new direction congress is saying that we value our families and their economic future this congress will fight to make sure that their hard work is rewarded and that the american dream is renewed this 5year budget conference agreement charts a new way forward for the country it makes investments in energy education and infrastructure it provides tax relief for the middle class it returns the budget to surplus in 2012 and 2013 and it remembers those whose service and sacrifice here at home and abroad provide the rest of us with security and peace of mind this is a budget with a conscience today as wemove to pass this conference agreement on the budget our country faces major challenges an economic recession a crisis in the credit markets a plunging housing market rising unemployment declining family income skyrocketing costs in health care aging infrastructure and a safety net struggling to keep up with the growing number of americans unable to meet their most basic needs faced with these challenges president bush and his republican colleagues proposed the same

policies with this budget resolution the democrats are ready to take the necessary steps as difficult as they may be to regain our economic health and reclaim our childrens future it is a balanced budget with balanced priorities it returns the budget to balance with projected surpluses in 2012 and 2013 by adhering to fiscally responsible policies it strengthens the unitedstates economy over the long term while calling for funds to help americans struggling in the current economic downturn it rejects and i repeat it rejects the republicans harmful cuts to medicare and medicaid the community development block grant program and liheap and it protects priorities like schip infrastructure needs homeland security innovation energy education health care veterans and the environment this budget agreement does not include any tax increases despite the overheated claims of the other side quite the contrary it supports significant tax relief including extension of marriage penalty relief the child tax credit the 10 percent bracket and allowing for estate tax reform it includes an additional year of relief for the alternative minimum tax that is fully paid for and it provides for property tax relief energy and education tax relief and extenders finally this budget remembers those who serve at home and abroad it provides strong and substantial funding for national defense including quality of life for our troops and their families it provides more funding for homeland security programs including first responders more than the president would it provides for the care and treatment of all of our veterans but most especially our newest generation of veterans those returning from iraq and afghanistan many of whom are grievously wounded and thousands who will require treatment for posttraumatic stress and serious depression finally it rejects president bushs cynical new fees for veterans health care in short this budget charts a new direction for a stronger safer more compassionate america there are two significant differences between the houseand senatepassed budgets which this conference report resolves first were the reconciliation revisions to the alternative minimum tax and the second is the level of nondefense discretionary funding on reconciliation the conference agreement drops the housepassed reconciliation instructions instead it provides for 1 year of amt relief that is fully paid for the house will continue to work with the senate to identify how to pay for permanent relief of the amt in the house such a solution is subject to our paygo rules of order and must be fully offset with the passage of this conference report any amt fix offered in the senate that increases the deficit by 10 billion in a year will also be subject to a senate point of order on nondefense discretionary spending the difference between the house and senate budgets was 3 6 billion and the conference agreement splits the difference by holding most nonsecurity spending to a modest 1 percent above inflation we are able to move the budget out of deficit and into surplus by the year 2012 while still providing substantially greater investment in

on the budget committee for reaching this point in the budget process this is not easy and they are to be commended for getting the budget up to this point i have long believed that the budget resolution is an important statement of congressional policy and a critical act of governing so in a sense i am glad to see this conference report here today and the gentleman from south carolina deserves credit for that that said the choices in this budget or some would argue the complete lack thereof represents an enormous missed opportunity an enormous missed bipartisan opportunity the democrats fiscal year 2008 budget sets off a vicious cycle higher taxes fuel higher spending and greater spending demand in order to meet this appetite for greater spending we are going to have to raise taxes again and again and again lets take a look at how this will work first the linchpin of this budget and numbers do not lie check with the congressional budget office its only one binding fiscal policy is the same one that democrats have been bringing to the floor time and again raise taxes this budget will raise taxes on the american economy and american workers by at least 217 billion that is the second largest tax increase in american history and to be clear their 217 billion tax increase is just an opening bid it will last only until the majority can raise the ante as you may recall the house democrats wanted and included in their budget a 400 billion tax increase that would have been the largest in history but the senate made it clear by a vote of 971 that they would not accept the houses number so from this conference report it would initially appear that the house democrats receded to the senates smaller tax number the smaller tax increase thats according to the cbo that is until you take a closer look at some of the procedures and gimmicks included in this report first lets look at the trigger there is this socalled tax trigger in short this trigger will provide the majority with an immense loophole allowing them to renege on their promise to protect certain highprofile tax benefits and they can do it without leaving any fingerprints because it would all be automatic all the democrats have to do believe it or not is spend too much money and that will set off the trigger and raise those taxes they are saying in this budget they want to extend marriage penalty relief the child tax credit and the 10 percent bracket but if they spend too much money guess what happens automatically those tax cuts go away then there is the 190 billion worth of unfunded spending increases promised in this budgets 23 reserve funds if they actually deliver on these promised 23 wish list reserve funds thats another tax hike even their version of paygo which they touted as proof of their commitment to fiscal discipline is just a means to make it easier to raise taxes what happens if they raise mandatory spending mr speaker you guessed it they have to raise taxes to pay for it so again this 217 billion tax hike is just the starting bid you can expect them to draw from that well again and again and again why is this a problem why do we have this huge difference of opinion difference in philosophy of ideology of economic doctrines because the enormous tax increases will threaten the economic and fiscal progress our nation has made these past several years as i have said many times before the tax decreases the tax cuts we passed in 2001 and 2003 have turned this economy around it brought us out of recession it improved job growth gdp growth it lowered the unemployment rate business investment and the entire market rebounded and all that growth has led to surging revenues coming into the federal treasury three years of double digit revenue growth at these lower tax rates the tax hikes contained in this budget threaten to reverse all of this and think of the impact this tax hike will have on the small businesses that it hits our small businesses who are already paying the second highest tax burden in the industrialized world will be told that they are just not paying enough in this increasingly global economy where these companies are struggling to compete with china and india imposing an even larger tax burden will be crushing it will severely threaten our ability to compete and let alone lead in the global economy so what will taxpayers get in return for sending congress ever higher cuts of their paychecks better working more efficient less wasteful spending no the majority doesnt even pretend they are going to control spending there is no control on the existing trajectory of spending we have in this budget we are only 5 months into this congress and at every opportunity the new majority has chosen the path of higher spending they increased discretionary spending by 6 billion in the omnibus another 20 billion or so of extraneous spending in the supplemental and now theyre increasing nondefense discretionary appropriations next year by another 23 billion for all weve heard about how the democrats had to clean up the mess the republicans gave them their only response to this seems to be spend more and tax more this formula has never worked for getting control of the budget in the past and it wontwork now its also the reverse of whats going on in the rest of the world across europe governments are moving away from their welfare state big government tax policies and toward more marketoriented policies for instance the latest most clear example but here in the states where we should be leading the tide toward free markets democrats are taking us in the other direction finally i think the biggest failure of this budget is not what it does do its what it doesnt do this budget does nothing to reform entitlement programs to extend their solvency we had a parade of witnesses from the left and from the right democrat witnesses repfblican witnesses the chairman of the federal reserve the omb director the cbo director all come to us and say youve got to get a handle on entitlements you have to reform the entitlement programs to make them more solvent to stop this enormous unfunded liability that is hitting american taxpayers even with the democrats 400 billion tax increase they had in the housepassed version that would quickly outpace revenues entitlements would swamp us so even if we hit a temporary balanced budget as this might achieve it will be temporary because you cant raise taxes enough again and again to outpace the trajectory of entitlement spending growth we will go back into deficits because this budget does nothing to control spending so why have the democrats failed to even address this dire situation because as senate budget chairman sen ator conrad told 60 minutes its always easier not to its always easier to defer to kick the can down the road to avoid making choices you know you get into trouble in politics when you make choices i appreciate that sentiment but we all know that is not what budgeting is about budgeting is about making choices even when theyre tough even when they are not politically popular because that is what we came here to do in closing i believe this budget fails to make any real choices let alone the right ones it will impose on american families and businesses at least the second largest tax increase in american history if not the largest add immense new government spending and put off critical entitlement reforms for at least another 5 years our house republican budget proved we can balance the budget without raising taxes and stop the rate on social security it is my genuine hope that the house will vote today to change this dangerous course and send the democrat budget back to the drawing board with that i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0014139413833618164, 0.9985860586166382, 1, "i rise today in strong support of the congressional black caucus alternative budget

energy and although you are a brand new member of congressyou havent been here for a long timeyouve shown just extraordinary leadership on the issue thats probably facing more americans today than any other and thats the dramatic increase in the price of energy and i know how passionate youve been on this issue youve worked tirelessly in your district and the people of your district in ohio are fortunate to have you as their representative thank you so much for working so hard on this issue its one that i believe probably every member of this body is hearing from their constituents over and over and over again i know that i have as well i had conducted a meeting with several members of my community who own gas stations independent owners of gas stations and one thing that they told me that broke my heart they told me that they are seeing 30 percent fewer sales at the pump and theyre also seeing 30 percent fewer sales inside their store and theyre hurting one gentleman told me that normally he would spend 10 000 to purchase the gasoline that would go into the ground in the holding tanks 10 000 and thats money thats out of his pocket sitting there in inventory until it can be sold and he said now i pay 40 000 to have that inventory in the ground and now sales are 30 percent less and so he has more money in the ground not producing for him at a higher and higher price level and he said this is eating up my entire profit margin there are people going out of business and so what he told me is weve got to do something to get gasoline back down from its 4 a gallon and thats what were about here tonight to say theres very good news on the horizon its doom and gloom when you wake up in the morning and you see and you hear on the radio and you see when you drive to the gas station what the price at the pump is but the good news is there is an answer and america can go back to 2 a gallon gasoline or less its entirely possible why because we have the answer right here in our country we are standing on our own solution we have energy thats available to us 86 billion barrels thats according to our own united states department 86 billion barrels of energy right now thats available to us in the form of oil in the outer continental shelf area we have over 10 billion barrels of oil thats fully recoverable up in the arctic energy slope this is an area of land that congress originally set aside specifically for the purpose of accessing that energy through drilling to bring back down to the united states i had the privilege back in the mid1970s of working two summers up on the aleutian chain in alaska thats when the prudhoe bay alaska transalaska oil pipeline was built that oil pipeline is currently up its running but it is only half full with very little effort we could actually tap into that oil pipeline the 10 billion barrels that we know are already in alaska and we could fill that pipeline rather than having it half empty we could fill it and bring down another million barrels of oil a day and 1 million barrels of oil a day translates into 27 million gallons of gasoline and that would mean a 50 percent increase in american reserves than were already tapping today thats just those 10 billion barrels that doesnt include the 85 billion barrels that are also available in the outer continental shelf in the deep sea energy reserves that america only has buti think most americans arent even aware that america is the only country in the world that has voluntarily made it illegal to access its own energy thats right we are the only country in theworld thats made it illegal to access our own energy congress caused this problem the problem is not opec and the problem is not speculators the problem is the united states congress i believe part of the reason why we are seeing congresss approval ratings at an astoundingly low 12 percent is because congress has chosen to make it illegal to access the answer that we need and thatsour own energy resources heres another great fact in the gulf coast region we have what is probably the worlds largest reserve of natural gas we have 420 trillion 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas thats available to us right now off the shore in the gulf of mexico we can access this and we can bring natural gas into our country use it to fire up our electrical grid and also we could even change our cars and buses run them on natural gas as well america also is home to 25 percent of the earths supply of coal right here in the united states klmost an unlimited supply we have clean coal technology today thats available to us that can process coal and transmit that almost unlimited supply of energy all across the united states and as well nuclear energy i have a nuclear energy facility in my home district in the sixth congressional district of minnesota and im so grateful we have that because nuclear power supplies almost 20 25 percent of minnesotas energy needs its a clean safe reliable form of energy and it has zero emissions i am so excited about this wonderful technology but unfortunately again congress has made it illegal for us to be able to tap into this wonderful source of energy whether its nuclear whether its coal whether its natural gas whether its the oil reserves that we have america has the answer in fact this is the industry that we can tap into right now we dont need to find a magic bullet or a magic alternative this is energy that we have available to us today that we could tap into today so we can see the american people very soon get back to paying 2 a gallon one thing that happened not too long ago was this body the united states congress sent out stimulus checks to americans all across the country why mr speaker because people in the united states congress were worried about the economy so we went to the united states treasury and we wrote checks that are still being sent out to americans all across this country why we wanted to entourage americans to spend money to stimulate the economy do you know what i believe the greatest stimulus would be to americans it would be to get gasoline back to 2 a gallon and its so possible it was just about 18 months ago that the democrat majority took over in this body and when they took over gasoline on average at the national level was 2 33 a gallon that average today is about 4 07 a gallon thats a dramatic increase in the price of gasoline unheard of increase in the price of gasoline it took us 25 years in the united states for gasoline to go from 1 a gallon to 2 a gallon and just in the time that the democrats have held the gavel they have taken this country from 2 33 to 4 08 a gallon i was listening to the previous discussion that occurred and i heard some suggestions about why the price of gasoline has gone up so dramatically and i find it interesting because if you look at the votes from 1994 until today this congress has already voted on whether or not we should explore in anwr we voted on it in fact the congress back in 1995 sent a bill to president bill clinton to say that we should be drilling in anwr the house passed that bill the senate passed that bill unfortunately it was president bill clinton that vetoed that bill otherwise we would have already been drilling in anwr we wouldnt be in the pickle that were in today but this is the vote and these are the facts im not trying to be partisan because we need to come together as democrats and republicans and solve this problem now because americans are feeling real pain and the economy is reeling over energy prices but heres the facts this is a fact any american can go and find out what the voting has been on anwr exploration of bringing energy down from alaska ninetyone percent of republicans have voted to explore in anwr and drill for oil in anwr 91 percent 86 percent of democrats have opposed drilling and that hasnt changed today because we already know what the democrat plan is for energy theyve made it abundantly clear it is very simple their plan has been lets have the united states governmentthat created this problemtake over the oil industry and nationalize oil refineries thats what they said last week at a press conference lets nationalize oil refineries well thats not a new idea but its not an american idea and thats not an idea that the american public wants us to embrace they dont want us to embrace socialism but thats what we heard democrats say last week heres the other part of their plan it is drive less and pay more drive less and pay more thats not what the american people want but senator obama the nominee of the democrat party just recently said it isnt the high price of gasoline that has him worried its how quickly that price went up well ill tell you one thing congressman bob latta congressman paul broun and also congressman rob wittman who was on the floor tonight its the high price of gasoline thats bothering us republicans dont want to see gas at 4 08 a gallon or 5 or 6or whatever that price could be by the end of summer we dont want it that price because we know for a fact we can get gasoline back down to 2 a gallon or less very simply if all we do is explore what we already know we have weve got the resources weve got the technology we can do this thing were americans were americans and we can do this just like congressman wittman said like w6 did with the apollo 13 we can do this and its exciting we dont have to go with the democrat agenda which is nationalize the oil industry take over the oil refineries we think the united states governmentwho didnt do such a great job at walter reed hospitalis going to be brilliant and bring down the price of gas by taking over oil refineries i dont think so i dont think thats who i want to trust not with the american people saying that we have a 12 percent approval rating i dont think they would trust us either and i dont think the american people want us to drive less and pay more i think what the american people want is what the republicans are offering and thats why im so grateful to congressman latta tonight for sponsoring this important hour on energy because what congressman latta is trying to let the american people know is that we can get back down to 2 a gallon of gas or less if we open up the key to our own answer which is open up americas supplies and do it in a clean safe environmentally sensitive way which weve already done how do i know that to be true because the united states was one of the only countries in the world last year that actually reduced its emissions thats right the united states is one of the only countries in the world that reduced its emissions all these other countries that signed onto the kyoto treaty the eu that signed onto this elaborate bureaucraticdriven cap and trade system their emissions all went up ours went down whats the difference we in this country believe in freedom we believe in freedom and we believe in free markets to solve our problems and they do free markets solve the problems its not socializing our oil industry like the democrats have suggested its not sitting home putting x sweater on turning our thermostat down thats not going to solve the problem its not going to be paying more at the pump thats not going to solve the problem it is unleashing american ingenuity and finding these new sources of supply which we already have with technology that we already have and bring the supplies in so we can make it happen i am so excited about what congressman latta is doing and i just want to end now with these other statistics and theyre very simple house republicans voted 97 percent of the time to have coaltoliquid technology to give us more oil at cheaper prices democrats opposed it 78 percent of the time oil shale exploration the united states is the saudi arabia of oil we have more oil just in colorado utah and wyoming than all of saudi arabia over 1 3 trillion barrels of oil republicans said yes lets explore that oil 90 percent of the time democrats opposed exploring that oil 86 percent of the time outer continental shelf where we have 86 billion barrels of oil house republicans voted 81 percent of the time lets explore lets access that energy democrats almost the flip 83 percent opposed exploration on refinery increase because you know we had over 300 refineries not too long ago in this country were now down to somewhere near 150 refineries the republicans voted 97 percent to increase the number of refineries democrats opposed it 96 percent i dont take any glory in reading those numbers but if you average them all together over 90 percent of the time republicans have voted to explore american energy explore it now so that americans can pay less thats our answer were not new to this dance this has been the answer that republicans have been giving since 1994 thats the answer we want to have democrats since 1994 almost 90 percent have said no lets not access american resources in fact lets make it illegal to access these resources well thats not what the american people say over 70 percent of the american people have had it up to here theyre seeing their lives change theyre seeing jobs lost jobs sent overseas they want us to explore here explore now so they can pay less and we agree with the american people and congressman latta is leading the charge tonight to let the american people know that were with them were in their corner we dont think they are the problem we think the american people are way out in front on this solution so i yield back congressman latta i yield back because i cant wait to hear what more you have to say on this issue and thank you for that opportunity"]], "top_incorrect":

cant go forth and the public doesnt wantthey dont want that to happen so the contortions that you see on behalf of the majority party on this issue are because their desire their zeal to end support for our men and women who are defending liberty and fighting tyranny and fighting terror around the world dont mesh they dont mesh there are some who get it right though throughout congress some members of the majority party who anderstand and appreciate what their leadership is trying to do one of those is senator joseph lieberman from connecticut speaker pelosi was quoted as saying democrats have proposed a different course of action over and over again we have suggested a different plan and senator lieberman was very sage when he said any alternatives that i have heard ultimately dont work they are all about failing they are all about withdrawing and i think allowing iraq to collapse would be a disaster for the iraqis for the middle east and for us slow bleed slow bleed that is a sad and dangerous time when we find our majority party here in the united states house of representatives supporting a policy that would remove the ability for our troops to do what they must do to defend our liberty what is our principle on our side of the aisle what is the republican principle well the principle is that our troops incombat deserve to be sent the resourses and the reinforcemepts that they need to succeed in their mission in iraq without strings and without delay without strings and without delay we have as a matter of fact a piece of legislation that would do just that representative sam johnson from texas a war hero truly a war hero an individual who spent years in a prisoner of war camp in vietnam an individual who knows of the challenges that troops face when involved with an enemy that is ferocious but an individual who understands and appreciates that from this chamber from that congress you cannot micromanage a war and when you attempt to do that as a congress when you attempt to have 435 members of congress who want to all be generals or 100 members of the united states senate who want to all be generals or commanders in chief when you have that it doesnt work it cant work it is impossible so if you want to have the vote i tell my friends i ask my friends i challenge my friends in the majority party if you want to have the vote on whether or not we ought to simply cut off the funding to support our troops in iraq and afghanistan let us have that vote let us have that vote i would be interested in the outcome of that i doubt we would get 100 votes in support of that and it wouldnt because that is not what the american people want the american people dont want failure and that is the prescription that the democrats the majority party are giving us we have a bill house resolution 511 introduced by representative sam johnson as i mentioned and it is very simple it states what the prihciple ought to be when american military forces are in harms way and that principle says as this resolution says congress will not cut off or restrict funding for units and members of the armed forces that the commander in chief has deployed in harms way in support of operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom that is it that is it the problem with that is that that doesnt fit the bumpersticker politics of the majority party that doesnt fit the orwellian democracy of the majority party that doesnt fit the hypocritical actions that are being taken by the majority party and consequently this bill is languishing in committee there is a discharge petition which as you know is a petition that members of the house of representatives can sign to be able to bring legislation out of the committee when it is against the will of the leadership that discharge petition was begun today what it allowsis members of the house of representatives when there are a majority of them and that takes 218 members when there is a majority of them who sign that then that bill then comes to the floor of the house for a vote so i challenge my friends on both sides of the aisle house resolution 511 sign the discharge petition this is principle this is principle this is truth this is the kind of support that our men and women deserve it is not feigned support it is not orwellian support it doesnt say yes i support you and then pull the rug out from under you it is not hypocritical support it doesnt say we want to support you so very very much but we are not going to do what it takes this says it all it says that we will not cut off or restrict funding for units or members that are deployed in harms way whycant we have a vote on that mr speaker what are they afraid of mr speaker what are they afraid of i would suggest they are afraid of the fact that this would pass on the floor of the house of representatives this bill would pass and because it doesnt fit their political agenda their political agenda then i doubt that we will see it unless we can get 218 members of the house of representatives to sign the discharge petition so what about this bill that they are going to bring to the floor what about this supplemental bill that the majority party is planning to bring to the floor this week of course we have been told it would be earlier than this so they seem to be having some difficulty within their own ranks in garnering support but what the bill does as we understand it is to put in place an inflexible timeline an inflexible timeline that says that the troops must come home regardless of what is happening on the ground unless the mission is completely accomplished in essence well as you know in battle and in war it is just not possible to have 535 commanders in chief that is not the way our system works not the way it ought to work not the way our founders envisioned it in fact it is curious when the articles of confederation were written and our nation was formed some of the aspects of those articles didnt work very well so the match 20 2007 cc founders ofour great nationgot together in a constitutional convention and they worked on issues to try to make certain that this federalist system this united states could come together and work together and one of the first things that they did was recognize that in the articles of confederation there were no provisions for a commander in chief so one of the easiest things that they were able to do was to get consensus on the fact that the commander in chief ought to be one individual and that that individual ought to be the president of the united states and the executive branch and that that was the only way to work it because obviously you couldnt have countless members of the house of representatives or countless members of the united states senate who were functioning as commanders in chief it doesnt work and they recognized that so putting in place an inflexible timeline that culminates with a date certain for the withdrawal micromanages our commanders in the field and it undermines the efforts of our troops on the ground i believe that i believe that putting in place the kind of artificial timelines and artificial constraints on our commanders on our generals on our troops would be a disaster it doesnt make any sense all it does is make political points and that isnt fact isnt fact it is just not republicans who believe that that would be the wrong course there is a remarkable orchestra of individuals and groups all around the nation that are standing up now and speaking out against the foolishness of that kind of proposal i cite for you the washington post now the washington post is a wonderful newspaper it has been around for a long time but nobody would contend that the washington post was a very conservative newspaper or a great friend of conservative thought nobody would contend that but what does the washington post say about this plan of the majority about the democrat plan they say it is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself that was written on march 13 just 1 week ago an attempt to impose detailed management on the war without regard for the war itself what volumes that speaks when you think about where it is coming from it is not coming from individuals who would have any political chip no political reason to embarrass the majority party or to call them out on a policy that may not necessarily be very sound what that does is demonstrate that they understand and appreciate the consequence of adopting what is supposed to come to this floor this week as the iraq war supplemental would be devastating for the nation of iraq for the middle east for the united states and yes for the world we have heard a lot about the iraq study group the iraq study group was the bipartisan group that got together actually a group that began because representative frank wolf a republican in this house added it to a piece of legislation that was passed almost a year ago what it said is that we ought to have a bipartisan group get together and work in a non political way to make recommendations to the executive branch and to congress about how to move forward in iraq they came up with a number of recommendations we hear it all the time from the other side that the iraq study group didnt endorse this or didnt propose this or didnt support that that they supported a withdrawal of the troops from iraq that they didnt support any escalation in the number in fact if you look on page 73 of the iraq study group that is another fact if you look on page 73 of the iraq study group report it in fact supports an escalation a small escalation of the number of troops in iraq what they also did was oppose a date certain for withdrawal again a fact i quote from one of the cochairman former secretary of state james baker who said in testifying before the united states senate committee on foreign relations the study group set no timetables and we set no deadlines we believe that military commanders must have the flexibility to respond to events on the ground i hope that my colleagues here in the house heard that i hope that they are listening because what they are saying what the iraq study group said is exactly what we are saying now and that is that this supplemental bill that has artificial timetables and artificial deadlines that are capricious and politically motivated clearly that that kind of action is not appropriate it wasnt called for by the iraq study group and would not allow the military commanders to have the flexibility that they need to succeed how about the los angeles times again not a paper in our nation that has tended to be terribly friendly to conservatives or republicans the los angeles times in an editorial on march 12 when it had reviewed what the majority party was proposing in this supplemental iraq war resolution to fund the hard incredibly diligently working men and women who are defending liberty what did the los angeles times say well the los angeles times called for the bill to be vetoed vetoed why would they do that i appreciate our receiving a message from the senate the message from the senate is that a senate bill was passed and we are pleased to see that we look forward to the time when the senate will take up some of the legislation that the house majority has passed that they have been so terribly proudof and look forward to working in concert on that legislation but i was talking about the supplemental war resolution that will come forward the bill that will provide for appropriate funding of our troops in harms way defending liberty and defending us and the proposal that is coming from the majority party is a proposal that would micromanage the operations of our troops it is a proposal that has been described as slow bleed which is a proposal that means that you will defund you will remove the funding from the men and women who are working so valiantly to defend us that is not just an opinion from our side of the aisle that is an opinion from all over many people are recognizing that the washington post as i mentioned had an editorial that criticized the majority party for coming forward with it the iraq study group supports in fact a minor small escalation in the number of troops and never said never said that they agreed with artificial timelines the los angeles times again a paper that has not been noted for its friendliness to our side of the aisle called for the bill to be vetoed they called for the bill to be vetoed why did they do so they said it is absurd for house speaker nancy pelosi to try to micromanage the conflict and the evolution of iraqi society with arbitrary timetables and benchmarks that is a fact march 12 of this year the los angeles times calls the war supplemental absurd and what about the national intelligence estimate the national intelligence estimate which was released in january warned of the dangers of early troop withdrawal they said that if coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in iraq i think it is important to give credibility to the national intelligence estimate those are the folks that determine in an objective way in a non political way what are the consequences or prospective consequences of actions that this nation takes this poster here talks about the consequences of failure it is important that we talk about the consequences of failure because many people not just on our side of the aisle but many people around this nation including the washington post including the los angeles times have concluded for themselves that the proposal that the majority party has put forward is a bill that will result in defeat or failure in iraq so it is important that we look at the consequences of failure for our nation what are the consequences of failure this is from the national intelligence estimate what they say is that iraqi security forces would be subject to sectarian control that interference by neighboring countries would occur in an open conflict that means iran syria other neighboring countries that massive civilian casualties and population displacement would occur massive civilian casualties i wonder if the majority party the leadership in the majority party has considered the consequences of that what would happen al qaeda in iraq would plan increased attacks inside and outside of iraq and spiraling violence and political disarray including kurdish attempts at autonomy in kirkuk clearly clearly failure failure will result in a much worse situation for the people in iraq the people in the middle east i would suggest much more danger in the middle east and for our friends in israel and it would result in a much more dangerous situation i believe for the united states of america so what are they doing what is the other side doing to try to pass this piece of legislation this hypocritical piece of legislation this piece of legislation that they are having such difficulty doing because again what the american people want and what they in their rhetoric what the majority party in their rhetoric say are two completely different things so what are they having to do well they are having to use a lot of what has come to be known in this town as pork the original estimate for the bill was about 100 billion about 100 billion the other side has now added over 20 billion to the bill and what are they doing mr speaker they are buying votes they are buying votes i would suggest that an emergency bill this is an emergency bill to fund our troops is not the appropriate vehicle for unrelated spending either foreign or domestic our troops ought not be bargaining chips our troops ought not be bargaining chips that is what the majority party is doing quoted here in a publication here in washington earlier this month it says democratic leaders see this emerging strategy as a way to encourage their liberal members to vote for the supplemental budget bill this emerging strategy is buying votes adding all sorts of items to the bill curiously this party the majority party ran in their campaign on this wonderful issue of fiscal responsibility financial responsibility making certain that everything that came through congress was paid for they call it paygo payasyougo make certain that you have got the resources in place in order to pay for whatever proposal you are moving forward well they have virtually thrown that out the window we have had a number of amendments on bills that would hold their feet to the fire and make certain that they were accountable on this paygo issue and they have defeated everything that would make them accountable they are doing the same thing here they willfully abandoned their pledge of fiscal responsibility not long ago they pledged to follow payasyougo budget rules and spending restraints to curb the deficit and this bill would not be subject to paygo last year it is important to appreciate that house republicans rejected a 14 billion increase in nonemergency spending that the senate tried to attach to an emergency troop funding bill 14 billion was saved for the american taxpayer in a bill that came to the floor of the house from the senate just last year under a different majority we saved 14 billion the majority party now is going to spend if they have their way with this bill at least 21 billion more than has been requested that is important because this is an emergency bill and as such it doesnt come under the normal budgetary rules so if they are able to spend 21 billion in this piece of legislation then what happens is that they dont need to spend that 21 billion in the normal course of activity in the normal budgetary process so it frees up another 21 billion and in fact what you get is 42 billion of more spending extra spending but our troops deserve the resources that should be in this bill the finite resources the resources that the president and the generals and the commanders in the field have requested they should be able to receive those resources now not after not after our friends on the other side of the aisle in the majority party carry out this incredible political charade of voting on a bill that will never become law in its current form because the senate the senate wont go along they have in essence said so there are some incredible quotes that i have regarding this issue of micromanaging the war and this issue of loading the bill up with pork there is a democratic claim earlier this year just last week as a matter of fact frbm majority leader steny hoyer who said there is no micromanaging of the war period as you know i already have outlined that individuals outside of the republican party and the republican cause have reached the conclusion that yes in fact this is micromanagement again the los angeles times editorial where they said it is absurd that they try to micromanage the war the washington post editorial said in short the democratic proposal to be taken up this week is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself aggressive oversight is quite different from mandating military steps according to an inflexible timetable even some of their own members have reached the conclusion that this indeed is micromanaging the war representative dan boren of oklahoma said just 2 weeks ago it is still micromanaging of the war this plan that our friends on the other side of the aisle have truly does a disservice to the discussion does a disservice to the debate makes it seem that all votes are for sale here in washington to members of the house really it is a cynical ploy spending the kind of money they are proposing to spend is not helpful at all where are they planning to put some of that money it is important to look at that we talk about the iraq emergency war supplemental an extra 21 billion where would some of that money go well 1 8 billion in crop disaster assistance it may be appropriate money to be spent but in an emergency war supplemental it is absolutely the wrong place if you will recall if this house if this majority party has its way and puts that money there what it will allow them to do is increase somewhere else spending by 1 8 billion and follow their shadow paygo rules 60 million for salmon fisheries it truly is a cynical ploy on the part of this majority party if they continue to march down this road of packing this legislation with all sorts of extraneous spending that nobody in their logical correct factual truthful mind could conclude was related to the emergency war supplemental 60 million for salmon fisheries 25 million for spinach growers spinach growers may indeed need some emergency assistance but in an emergency war supplemental i think not 50 million for asbestos abatement in the capitol and it goes on and on and on as we know there are very specific guidelines in this bill for our troops very specific dates about when they must be at a certain place in the accomplishment in the engagement in the execution of the challenges that they have before them very specific in this bill there is very specific language about the amount of money that is available for the troops and when it would be cut off if in fact those arbitrary timelines and benchmarks were not met but mr speaker i learned this afternoon something very very interesting and that is there is a significant amount of money for livestock american livestock in this bill that is real pork if you will it may be upwards of billions of dollars but i cant tell you exactly what it is because in the language of the bill it says that the amount of money that will be available for this livestock provision will be such sums as may be necessary that is unlimited and it struck me as truly ironic and sad that this majority party this democrat leadership believes we ought to have an unlimited amount of funds for livestock in this nation and a finite and limited amount of money for our troops in the field that contrast just speaks volumes it speaks volumes about the cynicism with which this hquse is being led about the hypocrisy by which this bill is being brought to the floor an unlimited amount of money for livestock in america and finite limited amounts of money and arbitrary guidelines arbitrary timelines for our troops in the field it saddens me it saddens me to serve in a body where the majority party has a leadership that is that cynical and brings the debate and the items that we discussed here on the floor of the house to a point that is so very very trite really so very very trite i have only a few minutes left and i wanted to spend a few moments discussing the larger issue the larger war qn terror i think it is important we do that because when the american people think about the issue in iraq and whether or not we ought to be there and the debate can be had about whether or not we ought to be there and that is an appropriate debate to have and i wish we could have an honest and open debate and an honest and open vote on whether or not we ought to be there a single vote on that but the majority party has seen not to bring that kind of open and honest debate to the floor of the house of representatives but when americans think about what is going on in the world they understand and appreciate that however things have been executed or delivered in iraq the activity that has gone on on behalf of the american people in iraq although they may have problems with that they understand and appreciate that the bigger picture the larger war on terror is a challenge that we must recognize in america and we all must face it is a challenge and the facing of an enemy the likes of which we have never seen you dont have to go far to find examples of that in fact the best examples i have found are those that come from the selfproclaimed enemies themselves this is a quote from abu musab aizarqawi an individual with whom we had as far as i know no concerns before he decided that he wanted to become a mortal enemy of the free world he acted upon that in a way that has been extremely treacherous he said we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology well that is a little chilling but it is important that we recognize that is the nature of the enemy in this war on terror the consequences of not engaging and not being certain that we prevail in this war on terror the consequences of failure in that activity would deliver a death knell to our society the issue is as large as that i try to visit schools in my district the sixth district of georgia as often as possible and i like to talk to young people and get their perspective on their life and what they see in the future most of them are very very hopeful and i share that hope and optimism for the future of our nation but oftentimes when we are talking about government and talking about politics and talking about the issues of the day i will ask them especially the middle school students and the high school students i will ask them do you believe the united states will continue to survive forever and it is an interesting question because it forces one to think well what allows us to survive right now what has been put in place that allows us to survive right now most young people when you ask them that question they have not really ever thought about that they have not thought about what has brought about the preservation of our nation the longest surviving democracy in the history of the world it is a remarkable question to ask most of them have not ever thought about it but when they do think about it they understand the gravity of the question they understand that there are challenges in this world they understand there are people like abu musab a1zarqawi out there who want to see the end of our nation as we know it that is not our opinion that is his stated fact that is what he has said that he wants to do so the gravity of the challenge that we have facing us is real and the magnitude of it is remarkable and the ferocity of the enemy is unlike any we have ever faced when i get individuals to tell me well if you just think about this in the way we fought world war ii or previous wars in which we prevailed then you will appreciate we need to do x y and z but i would suggest that the enemy that we are up against is not like any enemy we have faced if you dont believe me all you have to do is think about the terrorist plot and the attacks that were foiled because of the wonderful intelligence work on the part of great britain and the united states and pakistan last august and that plot as you will remember was a plot to bring down at least 10 or more civilian airlines carrying enough people who were flying across the atlantic ocean to bring them down in a terrorist act so they could kill more people than were killed on 9 11 so they had to have 10 or a dozen planes that they would work in concert to bring down that plot was foiled that was a real plot that was a real plan on the part of our enemy and that plan itself is chilling enough but when you realize and appreciate that two of the individuals who were apprehended and had participated in the planning of that and were intent on carrying out that act were a married couple a mom and a dad with an 8monthold child and they were going to use that 8monthold childs baby food in the airplane to be the vessel for carrying the bomb on board they were going to kill themselves and their 8monthold child and bring down a plane and kill as many lhnocent civilians as they could mr speaker that is an enemy whose ferocity we cant even comprehend that is an enemy who says we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology that is an enemy the likes of which we have never seen and that is an enemy that requires that we in the united states house of representatives work in concert together that understand and ap preciate the gravity of our time of this time and make certain that we do all that we can to follow the principles that have allowed us to become the longestsurviving democracy on the face of the earth part of those principles are embodied in the united states constitution part of that united states constitution that has allowed us to prevail and to have the greatest amount of success and provide the greatest amount of freedom for the greatest number of people ever in the history of mankind part of those principles stipulate that there is one commander in chief not 535 so if the majority party wants to have a vote about whether or not we want to end the funding for the battle that our commander in chief believes we must be engaged in in order to make this next step in the larger war on terror if the majority party wants to have that vote then lets have that vote but to do so as they are planning to do this week in a cynical and hypocritical way to load up the bill with so much extraneous spending tens of billions of dollars in order to buy votes to pass this hypocritical and cynical bill that micromanages this incredibly important endeavor that we are engaged in right now is wrong it does an injustice and a disservice to not just this body but our entire nation i urge my colleagues to encourage leadership on both sides of the aisle to support that open and honest debate i know on our side we are ready for that debate we are ready for that debate i would hope that the speaker and the democrat leadership would encourage and support that debate as well 0l 2115 it is an incredible privilege to come to the floor of the house and share these words i thank my leadership for that opportunity it is very humbling to serve in the united states house of representatives a body in which 10 000 or 11 000 or so individuals have served in the history of our nation it is a great responsibility in serving in this body but the primary responsibility is to make certain that we do all that we can to preserve and protect our constitution and our nation i would suggest humbly that the bill thatis being proposed by the majority leadership this week on the supplemental emergency war resolution is not a bill that does a service to our nation and does credit to the work of this house of representatives i urge my colleagues to bring forth the bill that will show that in fact we do indeed support the troops in harms way"], [0.9937241673469543, 0.9937241673469543, 0, "and one by mr pearce of new mexico two amendments were made in order bishop no 1 and pearce no 4 two amendments were not germane to the bill and ruled out of order by the parliamentarian bishop no 3 and flake no 5 the subject matter contained in amendment no 2 by representative bishop was already being addressed by a selfexecuting provision in the rule which was based on language previously adopted in this house by a vote of 4165 rollcall vote 171 with all republicans including my good friend from washington voting in favor of the amendment let me take this opportunity to clear up what must be a further misunderstanding on the part of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle contrary to what my good friend the gentleman from washington would have us believe the amendment was not the modified bishop amendment and i can assure you that the rules committee did not hijack any portion of the amendment submitted by our good friend and former member of the rules committee the gentleman from utah the provision in the rule was based ori language passed on april 9 2008 during consideration of h r 2016 the national landscape conservation system act and it was done to address a concern that a number of members had about the bill the amendment was offered by mr altmire of pennsylvania was adopted with an overwhelming rollcall vote as i said before with every republican voting in favor of the amendment if you dont take my word for it i would be happy to share the rules committee report from that bill which contains the text of the amendment and i have copies of the section of the congressional record that contain the debate and the vote on the aitmire amendment i also want to point out that the selfexecuting language in the rule is not an unusual or unprecedented procedure it was done numerous times when the other side was in the majority as my good friend from california alluded to in committee testimony on tuesday its a legitimate tool available to address concerns in a bill the amendment that we are selfexecuting is nearly identical to the altmire language the rules committee believes that this language improves the bill and it is entirely reasonable to selfexecute language with a track record of overwhelming bipartisan support in the house those members who dont like the language are perfectly able to vote against the rule now the question of gas prices certainly this is an important issue that has been addressed by this house a number of times we have seen oil climb to record 145 a barrel and we have also seen big oil companies continue to post record profits lets go over a few of the points that have happened in the past years the president signed into law legislation including landmark provisions to make cars and trucks more fuel efficient and to promote more affordable american biofuels that all happened because we passed it in this house and provided leadership on this the new fuel standards will reduce our oil consumption by 1 1 million barrels a day in 2020 onehalf of the current unitedstates imports from the persian gulf and will save american families 700 to 1 000 per year at the pump the house also passed legislation to suspend the filling of the strategic petroleum reserve and just this week the speaker called on the president to unilaterally start releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve in order to try and bring down the cost of oil on the world market a very responsible proposal we have also voted to invest in homegrown american biofuels in the farm bill we voted to provide tax incentives for renewable energies and energy efficiency and plugin vehicles and creating hundreds and thousands of green jobs we further voted to reduce public transit fares for commuters pinched by the pump we voted to crack down on oil price gouging and in fact were looking into more of that weve directed the cftc to use its full authority to curtail excessive speculation in the markets and other practices which may be distorting the energy market in fact the ag committee as we speak is meeting to look into this matter and plans another hearing tomorrow we have voted to hold opec accountable for oil price fixing and we have called on the repeal of subsidies to profitrich big oil so we can invest in renewable energy futures further i think its important for us as members to look at who in fact is moving to block the lowering of our prices at the pump a general blanket statement that we c n make that i have observed is you put oil people in the white house and you can expect oil prices to go up president bush and republicans have blocked virtually every step that we have tried to make to lower gas prices for the american people some of these steps have been cracking down on oil price gouging which was opposed by 140 republicans the first time and 145 republicans the second time including all the republican leadership the democrats in the house proposed use it or lose it for oil companies holding permits and not drilling there are 68 million acres that are available for lease right now and to be drilled upon that useitorloseit provision that was sponsored by house democrats was opposed by 176 republicans the motion to hold opec accountable was opposed by 67 republicans the first time and by 82 republicans the second time including most of the republican leadership the proposal repealing subsidies to profitrich oil companies and investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency was opposed by 174 republicans including every member of the republican leadership increasing commodity futures trading commission oversight authority to prevent manipulation of energy prices which was in the farm bill was opposed by 94 republicans the bush administration has vetoed or threatened to veto each and every one of these price control bills in addition the republicans 4ave initially opposed suspending the strategic oil petroleum reserve and while the president signed it into law it was only after issuing veto threats the president vetoed the farm bill twice which included the cftc provisions and the historic investment in american biofuels i mention all these in the context of my good friend from washington bringing up that mr clinton vetoed in 1995 a bill that was put forward on energy the republican party in this house is still blaming president clinton for problems 13 years after the fact when they have been in control of this house and the presidency for the last 712 years for the presidency and almost 14 for this house before we took over in 2006 i think its time for us to understand

statement that the commander in chief calls the shots we declare war if that is what the situation calls for and then congress shall not get in the way and micromanage the operations no war by committee and no interference here on the part of these members of congress except if they have an issue then they can do behindthedoors oversight they can have those conversations the presidents door is open to the leadership of this congress we know that if they have those kind of issues they want to discuss we have classified briefings here there are plenty of opportunities for oversight if not you can ask for opportunities for oversight but to set up this congress and to use the committees and use the committee chairs and the ranking members to somehow configure a away to bring in motions and micromanage a war is a guaranteed military debacle there has never been a successful committee operation fighting a war in history and there is no way that you can set a precedent here out of this congress especially as divided and as defeatist as it is tn the majority side of the aisle it seems to me that the will to win this war runs a successful clear distinct victory that would be written by the historians as a distant victory is not really something that is loved and anticipated by the people on the otherside of the aisle and this is not a stretch that comes out of my imagination but it is simply an observation from in this chamber when the commander in chief gave his state of the union address last month now when he spoke about committing to victory in iraq onehalf of this chamber stood in a thunderous standing ovation and the other half of the chamber sat on their hands in silence disgraceful silence could they not know that our troops in the field have televisions in real time over there in iraq and in afghanistan and in other parts where our troops are today supporting our troops that are in the front lines could they not know that our commanders all the way down the line to the privates are watching this disgraceful lack of support their lives are on the line and they will hear members from this side of the aisle to a man and to a woman say i support the troops i support the troops i support the troops and the question to follow is what about their mission do you support their mission and that is when you cannot get a question answer from hardly anybody on the democratic side of the aisle in fact the speaker herself declined to say yes to that point blank question sometime in december of last year she said it was not a matter of victory it was a matter of managing well they want to manage their way out of there and i will submit that the rule of warfare is victory goes to the side that is occupying the territory at the end of the war you cannot lift people off with helicopters off a unitedstates embassy in places like saigon and say well we really won the war we tactically won the war we did not lose a battle we won we left because we wanted to it was kind of an asterisk that those things happened down there we tactically did win every battle and our unitedstates military performed courageously heroically and gloriously and they need to be honored by every generation from here on out but we did not win the battle of who stood on the terrain at the end and these enemies that we have in the middle east are a philosophical enemy that goes deep back into history and before i go deep back into history i will speak again to the iranian issue of mr andrews which is he criticized the regime of iran i agree with him it is an unstable leader that they have and they have some mullahs that seem to be directing the action of that unstable leader so that cabal in the middle appears to me to be from our view from our western civilization view an irrational group of leaders he said the regime must never have a nuclear weapon i agree mr andrews 100 percent they must never have a nuclear weapon and yet we cannot go forward he said we cannot go for a reckless premature action against iran i agree with that as well it cannot be reckless it cannot be premature but does anybody really think that we can make nice enough talk nice enough be reasonable enough and take our case to the iranians and say somehow can we just put out an olive branch here and have an open discussion and find out what our disagreements does anybody really think that ahmadinejad or the mullahs would just then peacefully come to the table and they could be reasoned into a position of giving up their nuclear weapons i mean they came out yesterday and their announcement was that they will continue to develop their nuclear weapons and they say they have a right to do so but does anybody believe that they can be talked out of them i am wondering what it is about human nature that i see this so clearly that they have gone down this path they will not let go they will not give up why does anybody on that side of the aisle think that they can debate ahmadinejad into giving up his nuclear missiles and his nuclear technology and ability when i would ask them how long has it been since you have seen anybody in this congress change their mind because of the shear force of a debate i mean these are not so momentous a decision that we make but we come down here on the floor and how often can anyone point to a single time that they have said something that was soprofound so honest so insightful that another member said i did not know that i am on your side i will switch my position change my vote i will be with you because you made sense it is so utterly rare in this congress why would the gentleman believe that we could send negotiators over to iran and they would say well it makes sense to me we will just demolish all of that nuclear capability we want to sign a peace treaty with you all we will start trading and it will be a wonderful world again the reason that we have a problem there is because we have a fundamental philosophical disagreement and misunderstanding this began in iran when president jimmy carters belief in supporting religious fundamentalists caused him to support the return of the ayatollah and the demise of the shaw in iran and when that happened in 1979 that was the beginning of the hostile iran and it did not take very long before we saw 444 days 52 american hostages paraded regularly in front of our television trying to humiliate the united states and some believe that ahmadinejad was part of that group they think they have pictures that show him there a kidnapper of american diplomats i do not know i do not know if that is true or if it is not true but he certainly was not opposed to that that we know he is for the annihilation of israel the annihilation of the united states these dictators tell us what they think and often they follow through on the those actions and so no i do not trust the iranian leadership i do trust a lot of the iranian people and i would trust the iranian people to capture their freedom if given the chance i would paint this image in the minds eye of all who might be contemplating this in the map you will see iraq to the west and afghanistan to the east and right in the middle linked together bordering the two countries is iran now i will argue that afghanistan today is a free country and our troops were on the ground guarding the polling places the first time ever in the history of the world that since adam that there had been any votes that took place on that soil today it is a fledgling democracy it has its problems certainly it will we had our problems in the early years we have our problems today it is never pretty it is always difficult but it is always worth the effort but afghanistan is a free country iraq is technically a free country today the part that diminishes that freedom is the 80 percent of the violence that takes place in baghdad and within 30 miles of baghdad but iraq much of iraq is peaceful it is pacified and it is becoming prosperous i went over there the last time over the last thanksgiving i actually spent my thanksgiving day eating dinner with a good number of wounded troops in landstuhl germany at the hospital and encouraged by their courage that was the most monumental and profound thanksgiving that i have ever had or ever hope or expect to have and from there i traveled over to iraq where i did spend a couple of days in the baghdad area and then i went to a camp a forward operating base just out of baghdad and then on up into erbil in the north in the kurdish area in the north i have been to most corners of iraq over the last few years i try to get there as often as i can to get a feel for what is going on i do not think it is possible to understand that operation over there without going there i was encouraged by the level of peace and the growing prosperity especially that that i saw in erbil and up in the kurdish area you get out of the plane there take off your flack jacket toss your helmet in the back and walk across to the parliament i sat down with some members of parliament there and then they cooked also a turkey thanksgiving dinner that was something that i have not seen done as well in this country gregarious hosts and wonderful people that is how i find most of the iraqi people i do not accept a 60percent number that was delivered here by the gentleman from georgia that 60 percent of the iraqis believe it is good or okay to be attacking americans i do not know where that poll would come from maybe if you polled the terrorists you would get a number like that but i do not believe that that is the sentiment of the iraqi people the iraqi people are grateful that the united states has stepped in to liberate them there is a bit of a power vacuum especially in baghdad the presidents plan is to go in and fill that power vacuum muqtada alsadr has done a job in filling that power vacuum and he has been supported and funded and armed by ahmadinejads people in iran iran is fighting a proxy war against the united states within iraq you also have syria fighting a lesser effective but to a lesser degree a proxy war against the united states in iraq when the president came out shortly after september 11 he said if you harbor terrorists fund terrorists train terrorists you are a terrorist and we will treat you as a terrorist state iran is one of those countries syria is one of those countries i know of no example in the history of the world where an insurgency that could go back and hide and have sanctuary in a sovereign state has ever been defeated you have to take your battle where the insurgency is and if they have got a sanctuary you have to go to their sanctuary that doesnt meani that we need to take on iran it means that we have got to eliminate sanctuaries and we cannot delude ourselves into believing that we can negotiate a nuclear capability away from iran it would be just utterly ineffective because they have a goal and they have a vision and from that point i would submit that the background here of united states history american history instructs us on what has been historically and is televant to today i would submit that back in 1783 would be the period of time when the new united states made peace with great britain and at that time we had an american merchant marine that was sailing the world and trading we have always been a very effective seafaring nation and as our american merchant marine sailed and traded to the world and they went into the mediterranean up until 1783 they had the protection of the british navy because we were up until 1776 at least a colony of the british and so we are now rectified of their navy but when we were recognized by britain and began to fly the american flag and were not under the protection of the union jack 1783 america made peace with britain and then 1784 the first american ship was captured by pirates from morocco thus began the barbary wars where we took on the barbary pirates from 1784 and on up until about 1815 the united states was engaged sporadically and periodically but actually almost continually in a war again the barbary pirates along the barbary coast and before i go into that i need to give a little bit more of the history of that region barbary pirates in that region had been raiding the mediterranean shoreline especially the european side of that for years and i will submit that they had been raiding the shoreline for almost 300 years at that point in 1784 when they captured the first american vessel beginning about 1500 1502 1503 is when the barbary pirates began an active and aggressive pirating of merchant marines that were sailing into the mediterranean and their goal was capture the ship and the cargo and the crew and the most valuable portion of that was all too often the crew because they were pressed into slavery and they brought back european slaves to the barbary coast where they pressed them into slavery and they built many of the edifices that you see there today the old architecture from the 1500 era and on clear on into the early 1800s about 1830 much of that work was done by christian slaves that were pressed into slavery by muslim masters and in fact there is a book written by a professor at ohio state university called christian slaves and muslim masters and he has gone back and studied the coastline the european coastline of the mediterranean and old church records and other family records and old family bibles and put together a credible history of the slave trade by the barbary pirates as they moved in with their corsairs and took over the merchant marine the merchant ships from europe the barbary pirates raided the shoreline all around greece and italy and france and spain and all the way up the coastline of france and the atlantic into england and on over as far north as iceland in fact there is a fairly detailed commentary about 400 icelanders who were pulled from their beds at night just near the shore of iceland pressed into slavery and sailed back down to the barbary coast on the north shore of africa and of all of the slaves that were captured along all of that coastline from greece all the way up to iceland these icelanders survived the least and they perished the most they got the least amount of work out of them and they died the most quickly and that happens to be some remarks that are written into the historical documents some say it had to do with the climate change some say it had to do with the work they pressed them in some say it had to do with their hearts being utterly broken that they were pressed into slavery and they just lost their will to live but there is very little if any genetic remnant of those slaves today because the men that were pressed into slavery and it was almost all men they were never allowed an opportunity to do anything but walk in their chains and row the corsairs or else do their slave labor building the buildings and doing the kind of construction work that built those cities they didnt have an opportunity to procreate so you dont see their genetics in the faces of the people that live on that part of the continent today occasionally i am told that there are some blue eyes that pop up that look like they might be the descendants of the women who were captured aboard ship or offshore who were pressed into i will say concubinery and so there are some descendants from that but it is very little from remnants but all together professor davis documents about 1 25 million christian slaves that were pressed into slavery by the barbary pirates and this period of time would be from about 1500 on to about 1583 well it continued from that point forward and europe built a practice of paying tribute to the pirates and seeking to purchase back their most valuable citizens and it would be those men and women of substance if they had a wealthy family then they would try to go and pay tribute to get that member of the family back that went on for hundreds of years there was a pattern there it was a business that was being run and when the united states found themselves sucked into that in 1784 when our first ship was captured by the pirates from morocco that began the long conflict that lasted until at least 1815 and one will remember that the united states took a posture eventually we paid tribute here out of this congress to the barbary pirates and some of those line items that i have seen were as high as 250 000 to pay tribute to the barbary pirates but that would be just one line item and in fact that was a line item that was refused but we paid more than that on an annual basis and that tribute that bribery got so high that it became as high as 20 percent of the entire federal budget to pay off the pirates in the barbary coast and so we decided that we couldnt afford this any longer and we had two alternatives one was to outfit a navy and a marine corps and send them over there to punish the barbary pirates and get them to back off of any vessel that flew the stars and stripes so we sent our best diplomats over there to negotiate with the barbary pirates and i dont know that we have diplomats of that standing today but historically they will stand very high in the minds eye of americans and so in 1786 thomas jefferson who was then the ambassador to france and john adams who was the ambassador to britain met in london witii and i dont have this name memorized met in london with sidi haji abdul rahman adja the ambassador to britain from tripoli our american ambassadors jefferson and adams ambassadors to france and britain respectively asked adja why his government was hostile to american ships that even though there had been no provocation his government was hostile to american ships the ambassadors response was reported to the continental congress and is a part of the permanent record today that can be reviewed over in the library of congress the response from sidi haji abdul rahman adja the ambassador to britain from tripoli i will repeat was this and i quote it was founded on the laws of their prophet that it was written in their koran that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found and to make slaves of all they could take as prisoners and that every musselman and that is the term for a muslim today who should be slain in battle was sure to go to paradise sound familiar to some of the things that we hear today and jeffersons analysis his comments upon that valiant effort at diplomacy an effort that has been suggested by mr andrews here this evening jeffersons analysis was this and i will paraphrase and summarize and not quote but it is hard to reach common ground it is hard to negotiate with people whose profound religious belief is that their salvation is from killing you 1786 20062007 we think we have come a long way we may have not gained a single inch in this disagreement just had some interim conflicts and relative periods of peace i think the american people need to understand this and so out of the failure of that diplomatic effort that valiant diplomatic effort the united states navy was born march 1794 the marine corps joined with the navy and they went to the shores of tripoli and that is today in the marine corps anthem from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli and our navy was fitted and they designed frigates for americans and these frigates had superior speed and superior maneuverability very much an american thing that was the first time that americans went to war after the ratification of their constitution and they went to war with the most modern frigates that had a tactical advantage because the technology that was developed by the innovative nature and the inventiveness of american shipbuilders and today we are off in space with that same kind of innovation the marines when they went to the shores of tripoli they knew what they were up against to some degree and we have all heard marines called leathernecks most dont recall marines got the nickname leathernecks because they put leather collars around their neck thick leather collars when they went into battle to reduce the chance that they would be beheaded by the enemy that is how marines got the nickname leathernecks they got that nickname over 200 years ago and it is part of their history and part of their lore and the shores of tripoli are engraved on their iwo jima monument over across the potomac river and so we need to go back and revisit history and understand that this enemy is driven by the same philosophy they still believe their path to salvation is in killing us there are passages in the koran that support this almost verbatim that i have happened to have read thomas jefferson had a koran i understand that koran came to this congress to be used in a swearingin ceremony some say that he leaned towards islam because he owned a koran i will submit that thomas jefferson also studied greek and he had a greek bible he wanted to be able to understand the passages in the bible from the perspective of the greek rather than relying on the translations from greek into an english version thomas jefferson was perhaps the preeminent scholar of his time maybe the preeminent scholar in our history he took his work seriously of course he needed to understand nosce hostem which is latin for know thy enemy and that would absolutely be the reason why thomas jefferson acquired a koran so he could understand that enemy that said that it is written in their koran that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found and to make slaves of all they could take as prisoners and that every muslim who should be slain ih battle was sure to go to paradise what a promise to make and when that is a profound religion it is impos sible to negotiate with so what we did we went to war against them and over time put them in a position where they needed to sue for peace and i will submit also that algiers came under attack from the british twice and the french once and they didnt cease their attacks on western europei will say western civilization and the shipping industry within the mediterranean as a piracy approach as a government policy they didnt cease those attacks until 1830 when the french went in and occupied algiers and so here we are today with an enemy globally in the world which is a segment of islam and i certainly respect and appreciate moderate islam i february 8 2007 co ask them to step forward and be our allies i believe they are a peaceful people and a goodhearted people and the more i travel and the more people i meet the greater my respect and admiration for the goodness of humanity is but there is an element within islam that is radical islam the jihadists the islamists as daniel pipes has named them that element is a significantly large element and there are maybe 1 2 to 1 3 billion muslims in the world and according to daniel pipes our benazir bhutto 10 percent and according to pipes perhaps as many as 15 percent are inclined to be supportive of al qaeda now if it is 10 percent you are looking at 130 million if it is 15 percent add half again to that that is a huge number of people who philosophically believe that their path to salvation is in killing us and that they dont really take a risk with their destiny when they attack us because if they are killed in the process they will surely go to paradise that is the enemy that we are against may i inquire as to how much time i have left"], [0.9681150913238525, 0.9681150913238525, 0, "on rollcall no 21 on motion to suspend the rules and agree

make sure that the american people are secure we want to make sure that our troops can be successful we want to make sure that our troops come home and we want to make sure that the iraqi people can live with dignity the one thing that i will add with that statement that ms slaughter just made is that not only simply live with dignity but with the kind of selfdetermination that led to a 70 percent voter turnout in iraq so obviously we share the exact same goal that ms slaughter just outlined but i am very very troubled with the plans that we have before us frankly withdrawal that would begin in 90 days would undermine every single one of those goals to which ms slaughter just referred and this time it is not just the presidents opposition that stands in their way of what it is that they are trying to do their own colleagues in the senate have said that the house democratic leaderships approach wont work on their side of the capitol ej 1230 senate majority leader reid has criticized their punting strategy and acknowledged he has serious doubts that the house plan could actually get through the senate now this policy of defeat couldnt prevail in april it wont prevail in may so it would appear the idea is to wait and hope for the best in july now the war in iraq is not a game funding our troops who are in harms way is not a game these votes may make my friends on the other side of the aisle feel good but they arent doing anything to get our troops what they need to protect themselves and to fight effectively against terrorists around the world thats what matters here again going back to the words of the very distinguished chair of the committee on rules ms slaughter we want to make sure that we are secure at home the way to do that is to ensure that the troops have what they need we have an obligation to have a serious substantive debate to supply our troops with the funds they need to do their job and to demonstrate to the american people that we are doing what is necessary to win in iraq and to bring our troops home but rather than fulfilling our duties as responsibl6 legislators democratic leadership has simply scheduled one more empty political vote under yet another totally closed process in fact the democrats go so far as to have three closed rules two of them on appropriations bills now we will consider four appropriations bills this year and all of them will have been under a completely closed process and we all know under both democrats and republicans the tradition is that when it comes to wartime supplementals they be considered under an open amendment process but thats been thrown out the door this is a far cry from the open and fair congress that was promised to the american people worse yet buried in the appropriations bill is yet another totally closed rule completely and prospectively shutting out republicans 2 months from now hw~ and they even go so far as to totally deny us a motion to recommit something that we never did in the 12 years that we were in the majority and those were tame restrictions when compared to what they tried to do to the senate it has been said by my very good friend from massachusetts for whom i have the highest regard i served with him for many years on the rules committee i had the privilege for the past 8 years of chairing the rules committee and during that period of time mr mcgovern would regularly say that the rules committee is the place where democracy goes to die ithink that it is only fitting that it is the rule which provides for this bill for his bill that we will use to pronounce the time of death and while this tactic fails to achieve a legislative success here at home it fs already producing disastrous results in iraq ryan crocker the very highly regarded new ambassador to iraq ive heard a number of leading democrats a number of leading outspoken foes of what it is that we are doing in iraq speak very highly of ryan crocker ambassador crocker said last week in an interview with morton kondracke of the roll call that the iraqis are watching the democratic leaderships political games play out in congress they hear the calls to abandon our mission and it is taking away any will to negotiate among political factions and achieve an effective government capable of bringing about a political solution to the crisis as kondracke puts it in his piece and i quote what is going on in congress is hurting crockers ability to get the sides in iraq to make agreements with one another he goes on to say it hardens the sectarian divisions they think we are going to leave and instead of reaching across lines and making agreements with the adversary they are getting ready to go to the mat now that is what mr kondrackewrites following his discussion with ambassador crocker and its very troubling what we do here and say here has consequences and the report back from the new ambassador to iraq is that those consequences are not good those who would declare this war lost before the new strategy of again the very highly regarded general david petraeus who enjoyed unanimous support of the united states senate that means democrats and republicans on a recorded vote provided unanimous support confirming general david petraeus we are now basically with what we are trying to do here with this effort not even giving his new strategy a chance to succeed and i believe that it is a huge mistake now like everyone in this institution and people around this country i read the newspapers and i wbtch the news i watch the pictures on television and i know that the terrible images of violence that are broadcast every day permeate and as we see those horrible pictures i dont blame the american people for becoming extremely discouraged by what is being reported out of iraq and i will say that i am horrified by the pictures and the things that we see coming out of iraq but there is real and significant progress that is being achieved by our military the chicago tribune editorialized just yesterday on one of the great success stories that snccess story being the al anbar province which is the large province just to the west of baghdad its capital city ramadi was once described by the new york times as the most dangerous city in iraq and potentially the most dangerous city on the face of the earth today this former outpost for the insurgency is not only a secure city it is a model for sunni shia and american cooperation in the fight against the organization that was responsible for what happened on september 11 2001 that being al qaeda the chicago tribune editorial said al qaedas terrorists in iraq now face a new enemy sunni tribesmen in the al anbar province their editorial goes on and i quote these tribal leaders in the heart of the insurgency are now backing coalition and iraqi forces against the terrorists you want good news from iraq the chicago tribune editorial goes on to say there it is flashing in neon now this editorial goes on to quote the new york times report saying the progress has inspired an optimism in the american command that among some officials borders on giddiness there are some people who would say we have won the war out here one marine officer said i am simply quoting i would say to my friend the chair of the rules committee not something that a republican said but the editorial that appeared just yesterday i would encourage all of our members to look at that editorial in the chicago tribune now through the joint services stations that have been established local sunni police shia army officers and unitedstates military have worked hand in hand to take back the city and the province and drive al qaeda out with the full support and cooperation of the local sunni leaders the shia army has earned the confidence of the local population through their alliance they are achieving our objective for the entire country peace sustained by the iraqis themselves through national unity general petraeus came here as we all know just 2 weeks ago to provide members of the house of representatives with a classified briefing on iraq unfortunately the speaker of the house ms pelosi was unable to attend that briefing but for those of us who were there we were given a realistic picture from general petraeus of what was taking place he did not and i dont know all of the members who were there but i will say general petraeus did not sugarcoat the tremendous challenges that lie ahead in this war in iraq but he also described tremendous successes such as this great success that i just reported on in ramadi what was one of the most dangerous cities on the face of the earth and has now been stabililed in the al anbar province generl petraeus described the sunni arabs who have turned against al qaeda and have joined the iraqi security forces our american and iraqi forces have succeeded in detaining a number of key network leaders getting critical intelligence on how various elements of al qaeda operate in iraq taking apart a car bomb network that killed 650 citizens in baghdad and destroying several significant car bomb factories these are the kinds of joint efforts that are taking place at this very moment in iraq now general petraeus has spoken publically about these successes about the reduction in sectarian murders in baghdad by twothirds so far this year about the tripling of seizures of weapons cashes this year about the revival of markets and the return of displaced families to neighborhoods and cities that were previously totally uninhabitable because of violence these success stories are not meant to paint a rosy picture of iraq and i will say that again im not attempting to sugarcoat the situation in iraq im notattempting to paint a rosy picture of what is taking place in iraq i know how horrendous and what a difficult situation this is we all know the enormous challenges that our military still faces there and will continue to face for some time to come not just to be solved by september it will extend longer than that we all know that the other night i was with ambassador john negroponte who reminded me of the public statement that he made just as he left his ambassadorial post in baghdad he said it would be at least 5 years so we all know that this battle and this struggle is going to continue but what these successes do demonstrate very very clearly is that we have not lost this war they demonstrate that our men and women when they have the necessary resources can achieve victory we must give general petraeus adequate time and adequate resources to build upon these successes and make his newstrategy work setting a day for defeat whether it is today next week or at the end of july or september is simply not an acceptable policy rationing funding for our troops is not an acceptable policy now i offered two amendments yesterday in the rules committee that would have stricken two of the most egregious elements of this legislation first i proposed to remove the july cutoff date for the troops funding our generals in the field have said that this limitation ties their hands and keeps them from doing even their nearterm planning which is absolutely essential if the successes that we have seen are going to continue wars arent won in 2month increments and military victories arent achieved by congressional decree now my second amendment would eliminate the requirement that the president make his reports to congress on the internet even in its unclassified form this highly sensitive information would provide information to our enemies and the enemies of the iraqi people it would provide them with their blueprint for victory the notion of providing this report from the president to the congress not in any kind of confidential way but on the internet is absolutely outrageous there is no justifiable reason for us to give the people who are wanting to kill us and are responsible for the violence in iraq this kind of information now unfortunately neither of the amendments that i offered was made in order they would have provided an opportunity to consider a troop funding bill that would actually be enacted and would actually fund the troops rather than simply staging one more meaningless vote allowing members to posture now i understand very well having been in the majority for a while i understand that the democratic leadership is in a very tough spot they want to be able to say that they are funding the troops at the same time they have to accommodate their members who want to get out yesterday they want to get out immediately regardless of the consequences so their political situation is to schedule vote after meaningless vote they get their weekly opportunity to say i support the troops out of one side of their mouth and lets retreat and get out immediately out of the other side of their mouth but our troops and the american people deserve more than political gimmicks we must stop playing dangerous games with the lives of the american people our men and women in uniform and the iraqi people who have been struggling for freedom we must get our troops the funding that they need and give our military commanders the means to win and to do what we all want to bring our troops home i reserve the balance of my time"],

senator dick lugar and i established the congressional caucus for freedom of the press since then this bipartisan bicameral caucus has sought to highlight the importance of free expression around the world the caucus is a forum where members of congress can work to combat and condemn media censorship and the persecution of journalists worldwide our caucus works to send a strong message that congress will defend democratic values and human rights wherever theyre threatened we work to highlight abuses of press freedom and foster reforms in support of press freedom around the world we have hosted panel discussions with press freedom experts journalists and victims of press freedom crimes we have written to the leaders of countries which jail journalists impose censorship and allow harassment attacks and threats to occur with impunity and weve spoken out here on the house floor and in the media to call for reforms in countries that seek to censor freedom of speech and expression the caucus enjoys the support of a wide range of organizations including reporters without borders freedom house the committee to protect journalists the national endowment for democracys center for international media assistance as well as the legendary walter cronkite world press freedom day was first designated by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization in 1993 as an occasion to pay tribute to repressed journalists and to reflect upon the role of the media in general in advancing fundamental human rights as codified in international law regional conventions and national constitutions in keeping with that tradition we have hosted a special order hour in honor of world press freedom day each year since the inception of the caucus the universal declaration of human rights which is a foundation of the postwar human rights movement guarantees freedom of expression in article 19 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of any frontiers it may not be as elegant as our first amendment but its effect and its desire and goal are the same for americans this day should spur us to consider the role that journalists play ii our society and to ponder what our nation would be like if this cornerstone of liberty were to be curtailed many americans take the concept of a free press for granted and dont realize that an unfettered press is vital to americas national security and to our democracy here at home freedom of the press is so central to our democracy that the framers enshrined it in the very first amendment to our constitution thomas jefferson so valued the principle of press freedom that he said given the choice between a free government or a free press he would choose a free press he said the basis of our governments being the opinion of the people the very first object should be to keep that right and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspaper without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter journalists have jealously guarded their rights and american courts have in the main carved out broad protections for the press in the united states the press operates almost as a fourth branch of government the fourth estate independent of the other three and positioned as an agent of the free people winston churchill agreed with the idea that a free press was almost another independent branch of government saying a free press is the unsleeping guardian of every other right that freenen prize it is the most dangerous foe of tyranny under dictatorship the press is bound to languish and the loudspeaker and the film to become more important but where free institutions are indigenous to the soil and men have the habit of liberty the press will continue to be the fourth estate the vigilant guardian of the rights of the ordinary citizen from the pioneering work of journalists during the civil war to the muckrakers who were committed to exposing the social economic and political ills of industrial life in the early 20th century to the work of the washington post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein in uncovering the watergate scandal a year later journalists have performed a crucial role as watchdogs of american freedom but in order for the press to do its work properly it must be free and journalists must be able to do their work without fear of retribution information is power which is precisely why many governments attempt to control the press to suppress opposition and preempt dissent far too often the reporters and editors who demand reform accountability and greater transparency find themselves at risk the censorship intimidation imprisonment and murder of these journalists are not only crimes against these individuals they also impact those who are denied access to their ideas and information freedom of expression and a free press is not just a cornerstone of democracy it has also proven to play an important role in economic and social development james wolfensohn former president of the world bank has long argued that a free press is not a luxury it is at the core of equitable development the media exposes corruption helps build a public consensus to bring about change and facilitates the transmission of innovative ideas and valuable information that empowers people to share and shape their own destinies there is an emerging consensus among development institutions that a skilled and a viable media sector is a societys most promising tool for motivating government reform and poverty reduction regrettably censorship intimidation imprisonment and even murder of journalists are far too common in countries all around the world the map to my right provides a visual representation of press freedom rights by country this map was provided by freedom house which releases an annual index called freedom of the press a global survey of media independence the countries that are highlighted in green are listed as having a free press the countries in yellow represent countries that are partly free and the countries colored purple are cbuntries they describe as not free in terms of press freedom rights and as you can see in addition to problems here we have vast expanses in africa in asia in the middle east and in south asia to break it down a little more when taking population into account 42 percent of the worlds people live in countries that have a press that is not free forty percent of the worlds population live in countries that have only a partly free press that is exhibited here in yellow and in green we see that only 18 percent of the worlds citizens enjoy a free press quite remarkabie 18 percent free 42 percent not free and the additional 40 percent only partly free more than 80 percent of the worlds people therefore are denied full access to information this is not for economic reasons as you might expect such as printing costs lack of internet connections or illiteracy all of which are problems in their own right eightytwo percent of the worlds population 82 percent of the world is being denied access to information because their governments dont want them to have that access its also important to note that even as the world continues to globalize tragically press freedom continues to slip this was the sixth consecutive year that freedom houses index showed a reduction in global press freedom a worrisome trend as i mentioned this is the third special order hour we have held in recognition of world press freedom day the first year we launched our caucus we outlined the intention of our caucus and press freedom abuses around the entire world last year we decided that each year we would focus on a particular hot spot and highlight a single country where press freedom rights are particularly limited last year we focused on russia we profiled 18 journalists murderdd in russia during the administration of outgoing president vladimir putin all of these journalists were believed to be killed due to their work most of these murders remain unsolved to this day tonight i will focus on the lack of press freedom in china leading up to the 2008 summer olympic games in beijing this august i have chosen to highlight press freedom in china for a number of reasons including its failure to implement promised press freedom reforms before the olympics its incarceration of more journalists than any other country its lack of independent media and its censorship of the internet all of which i will be discussing tonight as the worlds most populous country china denies more citizens access to a free press than any other country it is also tied for 181st place out of 195 countries in press freedom rights in freedom houses survey to give you a bit of perspective china ranks between syria and iran in the survey and russia which as i just mentioned lost 18 journalists murdered journalists during one presidents administration that country is ranked ahead of china on the survey as i speak here tonight the chinese government limits more than 1 billion peoples access to an open internet and an independent media despite the fact that article 35 of the chinese constitution guarantees freedom of speech assembly association and publication unfortunately other articles in its constitution subordinate these rights to what is called the national interest this allows the ruling communist party to maintain direct control over the news media through the central propaganda department the cpd the chinese government has even proposed fines for domestic and foreign news organizations that report sudden events such as protests disease outbreaks or national disasters without government authorization some of these are public health emergencies epidemics that the chinese government wants to have the ability to hide these are just a few of the examples that ive chosen to highlight china tonight china is an enormously important country china has emerged in a big way on the world stage and china is a country of immense promise it is important both to the chinese government and to the chinese people as well as to the rest of the world that we help to promote press freedom in our largest neighbor in the world and one that will take a position of increasing importance in the years to come before i continue i want to thank all the press freedom advocacy organizations that helped provide this information for tonights discussion the committee to protect journalists reporters without borders the national endowment for democracy and freedom house have all been chronicling press freedom abuses in china and much of what i will share with you tonight is a product of these groups research investigation and reporting i want to thank them not just for their efforts in helping us here tonight but more importantly for all of their work to defend journalists and journalism around the world and i also want to take a moment to thank sean oblack of my staff for all of his effort and leadership in helping to put this caucus together and the presentation tonight during the olympic bidding process as international opposition grew to rewarding the olympics to china the chinese government promised to strengthen human rights in china this included a commitment to press freedom in the days leading up to the olympic vote wang wei secretary general of the beijing olympic bidding committee said we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china regrettably though china has not delivered complete freedom to its own reporters in september 2007 teng biao and hu jia two of chinas most celebrated human rights activists in an open letter to the international community detailed chinas failure to live up to its olympic commitments including press freedom teng and hu wrote as of this writing 35 chinese journalists and 51 writers are still in prison over 90 percent were arrested or tried after bejings successful bid for the olympics in july of 2001 for example dr xu zerong a scholar from oxford university who researched the korean war was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for illegally providing information abroad qingshuijun huang jinqiu a freelance writer was sentenced to a 12year term of imprisonment for his online publications some writers and dissidents are prohibited from going abroad others from returning to china due to this letter due to this letter hu jia now sits in jail i will be profiling his case later in the hour human rights watch reports that chinese journalists remain closely observed by state security agencies to ensure that their reporting reflects the official government position the governments publicity department heavily influences the weekly editorial content for print radio and television platforms by preventing the reporting of sensitive topics that fall under the vague metric of issues affecting social stability journalists that stray from the government line as teng and hu noted face imprisonment travel restrictions or are effectively deported foreign correspondents do not experience complete freedom either when reporting in china on january 1 2007 the chinese government introduced a temporary measure that was intended to increase foreign reporters freedom in china before during and after the olympic games this measure was set to expire in october 2008 while some foreign correspondents have experienced increased journalistic freedom since the measure went into effect most have not a foreign correspondents club in chinas survey showed that 40 percent of foreign correspondents have experienced harassment detention or an official warning during the news gathering in beijing and other areas one foreign reporter in china that human rights watch interviewed experienced harassment and had difficulty renewing her work visa after covering political dissidents and the highly publicized murder of chinese journalist lan chengzhang she told human rights watch i know the stories we have done have angered the chinese government and my visa renewal problems began after after those reports other foreign correspondents have been detained for legal reporting activities the new york times shanghaibased correspondent david barboza his chinese assistant and a photographer were detained for more than 10 hours by staff at a factory in guangdong province while doing a story about toxic lead paint disc6vered in the factorys exports to the united states barboza was eventually let go after writing a statement explaining the reason for his factory visit and stating that he hadnt obtained permission to take the photographs at particular risk are the assistants and sources of foreign reporters as theyre helping on stories that domestic reporters cannot cover one local assistant of a foreign press correspondent was told by security agents that it was his responsibility to notify the agents if the reporter was uncovering anything sensitive and warned him and his family of possible legal action if he did not sipa press photographer natalie behring described to human rights watch the obstacles foreign reporters face in finding a cooperative source in light of the new rules the chinese government cant stop us from talking to anyone so they intimidate the subjects of our reporting rather than intimidating the reporters in the fall of last year i along with my congressional caucus for freedom of the press cochair mike pence wrote a letter to liu qin president of the beijing organizing committee of the olympic games expressing our deep disappointment in the governments failure to live up to the promises that it made before the olympic vote in 2001 the letter expressed our frustration that chinese journalists face imprisonment for reporting stories unfavorable to the state are forced to toe the government line and the everincreasing restrictions on accessible material on the internet in the past the olympic games have helped establish freedoms in countries struggling to emerge from authoritarian rule most notably the 1988 summer olympics in seoul korea played a critical role in helping to bring democracy to that country its my hope that china begins to live up to its promise of complete freedom for journalists that it will cease the harassment and imprisonment of journalists and allow the chinese people to experience the full oommunicative and economic powers of the internet and that the games will usher in a newer freer era in chinese public life im now going to spend a few minutes talking about one of the extreme measures that governments take to censor the media and that is arrest and detention unfortunately its become commonplace for some governments to silence journalists simply by jailing them and regrettably there is no bigger offender in this regard than china and again this is one of the main reasons we have chosen to highlight china here tonight before i discus chinas imprisonment of journalists i would like to give a brief overview of this problem around the world and in fairness and in completeness while we are focusing on china because ot the magnitude of the problem there and because of the promises that were made in advance of the olympics its important to recognize this is by no means a problem confined to china tragically as weve seen in the diagrams we had up earlier press freedom is very limited in many places around the world and under great assault in many places around the world so china is not unique in this respect it is unique in its size its unique in some of the technological instruments it has used to effectuate censorship in this era of internet journalism but it is not unique around the world for this problem according to the committee to protect journalists as of december 1 2007 127 journalists were in prison around the world as a consequence of their work of these more than 80 were being held by only five countries however china cuba eritrea azerbaijan and burma this statistic only includes journalists that the committee to protect journalists can account for and that cpj has confirmed are being jailed it does not include another alarming category that the organization tracks and that is journalists who have either disappeared or have been abducted by nonstate entities including criminal groups and gangs rebels and militant groups cpjs research has found that nearly 17 percent of journalists jailed worldwide in 2007 were held without any publicly disclosed charge many for months some for years and some in secret locations the majority of journalists being imprisoned are being held on spurious antistate allegations such as subversion or divulging state secrets or acting against some undefined national interests cpj has found out that about 57 percent of journalists in their survey are jailed under these charges and of those many are being held regrettably by the chinese government these statistics demonstrate that china is not the only offender in this practice but clearly one of the worst as we have stated we have set aside this time tonight to highlight china but while we are on the subject of jailing journalists nationwide i would like to take a brief moment to discuss one particular case in eritrea that was brought to my attention by a constituent of mine who works with amnesty international group 22 in pasadena eritrea is a country of only 4 6 million people yet it imprisons the thirdmost journalists of any country 14 whats worse the government of eritrea will not even confirm whether the journalists in its custody are alive or dead and it also holds the most journalists in secret locations one such journalist being held in a secret location in eritrea is seyoum tsehaye a freelance reporter his arrest and jailing was believed to be part of the governments crackdown to eliminate political dissent ahead of elections scheduled for december of 2001 which were later cancelled he was arrested on the street in september of that year the first day of a major roundup and imprisonment of reformers in eritrea there are concerns about his health but the government has refused to provide details about his wellbeing he has never been allowed a family visit or a lawyer he has never been charged or appeared before any court last year reporters without borders honored him as their 2007 journalist of the year and tonight we take a moment to think about seyoum tsehaye freelance reporter in eritrea held in custody in a secret location since september of 2001 so its clear this is a problem not only associated with china it is also clear there are more cases of imprisoned journalists around the world than we have time to discuss tonight or for that matter over the course of a great many nights its important though to cast a spotlight tonight on china because of the significant role it plays on the international stage its one thing to talk about eritrea and the role it plays its another to talk about one of the worlds superpowers with all of its promise with all of its future and with a current policy extremely inhibiting of a free press in addition to hosting the summers olympic games chinas the world most populous nation permanent member of the united nations security council and as i mentioned an emerging superpower rightly or wrongly many countries look to china to set an example that others can follow in this case that is a great concern to the wellbeing of global citizenry as i mentioned here tonight china promised the world community to improve press freedom in advance of the olympics for 9 years however it has held the distinction of being the worlds largest jailer of journalists as the internet continues to grow and more and more people around the world have access to the internet more people are getting their news online nowhere is this truer than in china this is a fact that the chinese government has not overlooked and that is why 18 of the 29 jailed journalists worked online according to cpj reporters without borders lists china as jailing an additional 50 cyberdissidents chinas list includes imprisoned internet journalist shi tao an awardwinning journalist who is serving a 10year sentence for emailing details of a government propaganda directive to an overseas web site well talk more about shi tao later tonight but the list of chinas unenviable distinctions when it comes to press freedom and the jailing of journalists includes one other significant fact cpa lists china as having the longestserving journalists in jail chen renjie and lin youping were jailed in china in july 1983 for publishing a pamphlet titled ziyou bao freedom report and their codefendant chen biling was executed we will profile these journalists later tonight as well journalists in china are also held in appalling conditions prison is never pleasant no matter what country you are in but reporters without borders reports that journalists in jail in china frequently experience the harshest of conditions they are placed in overcrowded cells subjected to forced labor and regularly beaten by their guards and fellow prisoners this ill treatment is at its worst in the first weeks in custody when police try to extract confessions many of the charges weighed against journalists in china are trumped up for americans these charges are pretty unimaginable to give you some perspective on why some of the journalists are sitting in jail right now i am going to briefly mention a few of their cases these cases are examples of journalists being jailed for what we in the west would consider responsible journalism i wouldnt even get into some of the other journalism we see here as well the rest of the world but for laudable journalism for journalism we would applaud in this country these journalists are being jailed zhang jianhong for example the former editor of the now closed news website aegean sea was arrested in 2006 and charged with inciting subversion for posting an essay criticizing chinas human rights record and the poor treatment of journalists ironically ahead of the olympic games lawyer yan maodong who also calls himself guo feixiong and his picture is here as well in the upper righthand corner was arrested in september of 2006 because of his critical writings and human rights activism he was officially accused of selling a book using a false publishing reference but he says the books content was what the government objected to but imagine being jailed since september of 2006 on the charges of using a false publishing reference according to the new york times guo had repeatedly called on chinas communist party leadership to liberalize the political system his wife and supporters in the international human rights community have said that guo has been tortured in custody and that the police coerced him to confess to a nonpolitical crime he was entenced to 5 years in prison in november of 2007 for illegal commercial activity the new york times has also reported that a tibetan scholar dolma kyab dolmas picture is here to my far right has been jailed since 2005 after writing an unapproved history of tibet reporters without borders reports that dolma was sentenced to 10 years in prison at a secret trial on september 16 2005 by the lhasa peoples intermediate court for endangering state security and for alleging spying he managed to smugglea letter out of prison in september 2005 to the u n human rights commission saying he had been jailed for writing about democracy freedom and the situation in tibet zheng yichun is another illustration of the problem in china he was sentenced to 7 years in prison followed by 3 years of deprivation of political rights for writing a series of editorials that directly criticized the communist party and its control of the media li changqing a journalist for the fuzhou daily was sentenced to 3 years in prison for spreading false and alarmist information when he reported about a 2004 dengue fever outbreak in may 2006 internet writer yang tongyan was sentenced to 12 years in prison for posting articles on overseas web sites in which he simply called for the release of chinese dissidents in july 2006 li yuaplong a reporter for the bijie daily was sentenced to 2 years in prison after he posted essays on foreign web sites in which he discussed the harsh living conditions of peasants in the guizhou province yu huafeng i believe we have yus picture right here to my immediate right was the deputy editor and general manager of the nanfang dushi bao southern metropolitan news he was detained less than a month after the newspaper reported a suspected sars case in guangzhou the first case since the epidemic died out in july 2003 thankfully mr huafeng was released earlier this year when his sentence was reduced zi beijia of beijing tv was sentenced by the beijing number 2 intermediate court to a year in prison for the unusual crime of infringing on the reputation of a commodity that is really quite remarkable zis arrest came amid widespread international reports about food and product safety defects in china after the arrest cpj research found that domestic news reports about consumer safety were noticeably tamer imagine in this country if you could jail a journalist for infringing on the reputation of a commodity for taking issue with the safety of a childs toy lead paint the safety of a train or an air bag imagine if you could be jailed for that and you can imagine the situation that occurs in present day china wu lihong an environmental activist was jailed after criticizing the ongoing polluting of lake taihu the countrys third biggest lake and a major source of drinking water in the eastern province of jiangsu he also denounced the uncontrolled dumping of industrial waste by privatized city owned firms after being hounded by police and local organizations he was arrested in april 2007 and thrown in jail accused of demanding money from the firms he was tortured during interrogations and not allowed any defense witnesses at his trial he was sentenced to 3 years in prison for theft and extortion and again it is hard to imagine what it would be like in this country if reporting about contamination of drinking water or dumping of toxics into a lake would end you up in prison for a matter of years without any ability to present the defense and unfortunately that is the situation that wu lihong found himself in an outbreak of disease government corruption public safety concerns to me these are stories that the press should be reporting indeed in terms of the interests of the chinese people these are stories the chinese people need to know these are the stories that the public has the right to know about and the press has an obligation to report articles like these were exactly what the framers of our constitution had in mind when they drafted the first amendment this is exactly what thomas jefferson said and had in mind when he said that no government ought to be without censors in his case he was meaning critics and where the press is free no one ever will the chinese government is not censoring the press out of national security concerns but instead to shield itself from what a free press might uncover about corruption inefficiency human rights abuses environmental issues health problems or any other afflictions that might accompany authoritarian rule chinas censorship and intimidation of media are not limited to chinese journalists freedom house has also highlighted the convictions of two chinese journalists working for the beijing bureau of the new york times and ching cheong a correspondent for singapores straits times in china their convictions may have been intended to intimidate foreign correspondents and newspapers according to reporters sans frontieres there were at least 25 incidents of arrests threats or assaults against members of the foreign press in 2006 alone so not only is the government in china jailing journalists to keep information from its own people but it is also seeking to censor information to the rest of the world with this understanding of how and why the chinese government has sought to jail journalists i think it is important now to profile some of the most egregious cases the reporters involved here are true profiles in courage these journalists knew the consequences of their writings in advance of their publication and yet these chinese journalists believe so strongly that all citizens deserve access to information that they are willing to put their freedom on the line to better inform the public these journalists ought to be commended for their work not jailed and that is what we are doing here tonight we are saying thank you to all the brave chinese journalists eritrean journalists cuban journalists and all other journalists around the world who have risked their safety and freedom to spread valuable information around their countries and around the world information that we benefit from the concept of censorship of the media can be so strange to us here in america that we often dont realize that journalism can cost one his or her freedom or even their life as we have seen in russia and indeed in china so lets go to some of these profiles i would like to start the profiles tonight with the leading activist named hu jia who called for greater attention to human rights around the olympics and was arrested on january 30 of this year according to human rights watch press freedomand hu is pictured to my rightand human rights organizations are concerned that hu is being prosecuted simply for exercising his rights to freedom of opinion and expression at issue is an open letter that he coauthored calling for the international community to look beyond the veneer put in place in beijing for the olympics and to seriously examine the extent to which china had fulfilled the promises it made to improve human rights in advance of the games three months after publicatio of this letter hu was arrested at his home on april 3 2008 he was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment for incitement to subvert state power a charge regularly leveled against activists and dissidents reporters without borders has reported that chinese authorities have prevented hu from appealing his sentence one of his lawyers li fangping was refused permission to see him 10 days after the sentence was handed down the authorities said he was undergoing a medical examination prior to entering prison he was again refused permission to see him on a later date on the grounds that the deadline for filing the appeal had already expired according to reporters without borders li wanted to give him official documents related to his appeal which he urgently needed for him to sign but the guards refused without giving any reason hu has not been allowed to take any telephone calls and his family is very worried about the state of his health the plight of hu has been recognized by leaders around the world earlier this year it was reported then when our secretary of state condoleezza rice met with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao in beijing she raised human rights issues and voiced concern about the situation of political prisoners of hu and shi tao whom i will speak about next the following day chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao insisted that hu was being detained legally earlier this year the paris city council named hu an honorary citizen of paris this title was bestowed on hu for his work as an activist on behalf of human rights free expression the environment and hiv aids sufferers other people to have been declared honorary citizens of paris include ingrid betancourt a colombian politician with french citizenship currently a hostage of farc guerillas and burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi i next i would like to profile shi tao the chinese government 9ften uses vaguely worded laws to detain journalists dissidents and others in the peaceful exercise of their right of free expression including those arrested for the legitimate use of the internet this is despite the fact that the right to freedom of expression is protected in chinas constitution one of the many unfortunate examples of this practice is the continued imprisonment of shi taohis photograph exhibited herea journalist and poet imprisoned solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression and his right to seek receive and impart information shi the former editorial director at the changshabased newspaper dangdai shang bao was detained near his home in taiyuan in the shanxi province in april 2004 mr tao sent an email from his yahoo account to a unitedstates based prodemocracy website in which he summarized a government order directing media organizations in china to downplay the upcoming 15th anniversary of the tiananmen crackdown in the anonymous email sent several months before his arrest shi transcribed his notes from the local propaganda department instructions to the newspaper which included directives on coverage of the falun gong and the upcoming 15th anniversary of the military crackdown on demonstrators at tiananmen square the official xinhua news agency reported that the national administration for the protection of state secrets later certified the contents of the email as classified later certified them as classified 2115 on the basis of this email police arrested shi 6 months later in november of 2004 charging him with illegally providing state secrets to foreign entities as if chinese efforts to downplay or fail to report on tiananmen were somehow a state secret on april 27 2005 the changsha intermediate peoples court found shi guilty and sentenced him to a 10year prison term in june in june the hunan province high peoples court rejected his appeal without granting a hearing court documents in the case revealed that yahoo had supplied information to chinese authorities that helped them identify shi as the sender of the email in november of 2005 cpj honored shi with its annual internation press freedom award for his courage and defending the ideals of free expression on june 4 2007 the 18th anniversary of tiananmen square shi received an additional honor the golden pen of freedom award the award is the annual press freedom prize from the world association of newspapers which is based in paris and is the global organization for the newspaper industry it has awarded the golden pen annually since 1961 shi also was presented with pen new englands vasyl stus award in 2006 the award is presented to a writer who has been persecuted for the peaceful expression of his or her views and whose courage in the face of censorship and oppression has been exemplary this award is named after the poet vasyl stus who became a leading voice of his generation and who was also the last ukranian writer to die in the soviet gulag unfortunately all of these awards are presented in absentia due to mr shis continued incarceration his mother accepted the golden pen of freedom award from wan on his behalf in june of last year at the awards ceremony she expressed what the award meant to both her and her son when she stated in china he was taken as a criminal but today wan made up of over 100 newspaper organizations awards him the golden pen of freedom it is not only an honor but also a huge comfort to shi tao it proves that my son is indeed innocent he has only done what a courageous journalist should do that is why he has got the support and the sympathy from his colleagues all over the world who uphold justice here and now i am able to stand on the stage on behalf of my son what an arduous journey it has been to tell you the truth i cant believe it is true and even the best human language in the world cannot express the gratitude from the mother and son its good to know that awards like these help provide at least a little comfort for journalists like shi but more importantly these awards should raise awareness surrounding press freedom abuses around the world mr shi is clearly deserving of all these accolades the chinese people and citizens around the world are thankful for his dedication to true journalism next iam going to speak about two dedicated chinese journalists who have been detained longer than any journalists in the world today chen renjie and lin youping twentyfour years after their imprisonment in the early days of chinas economic reform chen renjie and lin youping have been in prison longer than any journalists in cpjs worldwide census the two men along with chen biling wrote and published a pamphlet entitled ziyou bao freedom report they distributed 300 copies of the pamphlet in the southern chinese city of fuzhou fujian province in september the following july they were arrested and accused of making contact with taiwanese spy groups and publishing a counterrevolutionary pamphlet according to government official records of the case the men used propaganda and incitement to encourage the overthrow of the peoples democratic dictatorship and the socialist system in august 1983 chen was sentenced to life in prison and lin was sentenced to death with reprieve chen biling was sentenced to death and later executed their case is so old and with the lack of an independent and open media we have had a hard time finding out more information about chen renjie and lin however i would be remiss if i did not pay special attention to highlight these two reporters who have endured more time in jail due to their effort to share information than any other journalist today the last topic i want to focus on tonight is internet censorship according to freedom house china is the worlds second largest population of internet users after the united states with an estimated 210 million people online or just under 16 percent of the countrys population however access to china to the internet in china is not the same as access to the internet here in america freedom houses 2008 press freedom survey reported that last year in china was marked by additional internet restrictions as well as the jailing of more online journalists and bloggers according to their findings in 2007 at least nine additional journalists and online writers were detained during the year for information they had published on the internet particularly on unitedstates based independent chinese news web sites in china web sites that have not established or not been established by an official news outlet such as a newspaper or broadcaster are forbidden from gathering or editing their own news or commentary legally they can only reproduce material that has passed through sensors at approved media organizations as we have mentioned tonight all media in china are government controlled china is not the only country to manage public opinion by controlling the internet as of 2007 cpj had documented internet censorship in 22 countries worldwide but china was first to launch a comprehensive program to censor online speech and to monitor email and text messaging its censorship program is so expansive and technically sophisticated that countries such as vietnam zimbabwe and thailand have adopted its practices this gets back to what i have referred to earlier tonight the fact that because of its prominence china sets an example for good or for bad in this case regrettably for ill due to technological advancements and the efforts of overseas activists the chinese government attempt to suppress information has become more difficult but that has not stopped the governments efforts to censor online information many have referred to internet restrictions in china as the great firewall of china the government employs extensive surveillance and filtering systems to prevent internet users from accessing material that the government considers obscene harmful to national unity or politically subversive in may of 2007 reporters without borders launched a web site in chinese and it was blocked within hours of going live additionally all ip addresses linked to a web site deemed undesirable are blocked without warning as the web has become a new forum to distribute information the chinese government continues to create new laws to suppress the free flow of information on the internet in the 5 years after china first allowed private internet accounts in 1995 it has issued more than 60 sets of regulations to tighten its control of online content these regulations continue today in 2005 the government introduced new regulations that bar web sites from distributing information that violates chinese constitutional provisions endangers national security encourages illegal strikes or promotes unrecognized religious groups in march of 2007 the ministry of culture and the ministry of information industries banned the opening of new internet cafes 113 000 were in existence at the time many times internet censorship is used as a political tool internet censorship in china increased prior to and during the 17th party congress in october of last year during which the party leadership for the next 5 years was endorsed between april and september access to over 18 000 web sites was blocked the committee to protect journalists reported that in september of 2007 security agencies in several regions ordered internet data centers which host large numbers of web sites and blogs to suspend their service or disable interactive features such as bulletin boards and comment sections during the congress meeting in an apparent effort to overcome difficulties monitoring audiovisual content with automated filtering technology the goternment issued a regulation requiring web sites with audio visual context to apply for permits i guess that would pretty well put youtube and other like web sites out of business the regulation which affects approximately 60 000 sites in china also banned audiovisual content deemed to fall into vaguely defined categories such as opposing the principles of the peoples republic of china constitution harming national unity contributing to ethnic divisions or disrupting social harmony so if there were entrepreneurs who wanted to start a chinese version of youtube unless they register unless youtube registers that would be prohibited indeed the content on those sites would be strictly scrutinized by the chinese government according to freedom house in some instances restrictions were imposed on a local level after bloggers supported a protest against construction of a chemical factory near the southern city of xiamen the local government adopted measures requiring internet users to provide their real names when posting material on more than 100 000 web sites registered in the city the chinese government demands that individual service providers monitor content these providers filter searches block web sites delete content and monitor email traffic the chinese language search engines of many unitedstates firms filter search results and restrict access to information about topics deemed sensitive by the government these include searches such as falun gong tibetan independence and human rights unitedstates filters have to adopt certain restrictions unitedstates sites like youtube and others are subject to the same scrutiny in 2007 more than 20 companies some american were forced to sign a selfdisciplined pact which forces them to censor the content to blogs they host in china as bloggers to provide their real identity and to delete postings considered illegal and unhealthy despite all this discouraging news there is a silver lining though the governments efforts are not foolproof brave and determined

to be very pleased with what offered in the appropriations process i have done each one has been the same to hold the other issue is that we are talking the line on spending i dont do it to be about a 200 000 earmark and i had a pain in the rear to the committee or hoped for significantly more than that to the ranking member i appreciate we are spending 285 million a day 11 the work of the committee and our million a hour in iraq if you subtract ranking member and those involved on 200 000 that would reduce the number this committee in bringing this bill of cocacolas in iraq by about four forward cases based on the price they have been i do it because we have a spending gouging problem we have a spending problem i yield back thebal in this congress and in this governance of my time ment and there is going to come a day when we are going to have to deal with it there is no better time to start than now and no better place to start than to say lets just hold the line because here is what happens every single time government continues to spend and spend and spend it inevitably leads to higher taxes higher taxes that hurt our economy higher taxes that hurt our standing in the international marketplace but most importantly higher taxes that hurt families out there trying to do the things for their kids and their grandkids so they can experience the american dream if you dont believe me that spending is going to lead to higher taxes all you have to do is look at yesterdays roll call where there is a story in fact we just had the distinguished chairman from the ways and means committee down here defending an earmark in his district but he is talked about and the article talks about the tobacco tax that they are looking to put on the american people to fund increased spending the old line its tax and spend tax and spend politicians its actually the opposite its spend and tax spend and tax spending drives the equation and that is why we need to begin to get a handle on spending thats what this amendment does in the course of offering these amendments over the last several weeks we have consistently heard two arguments from the majority party the first is the old devastating cut argument that somehow if we just spend what we spent last year that will somehow be terrible and the sky will fall and the world will end and everything will go to chaos i find that hard to believe in light of the fact that countless number of american families have to do that all the time live on last years budget but somehow government never seems to be able to do that i the other line that we have heard and i find this one somewhat amazing but the line is how dare republicans talk about holding the line on spending because you increased spending over the last several years as well i am fascinated by that argument because the argument when you boil it down is this because republicans spent too much we are going to spend more so i fail to see the logic in those two arguments what i do understand is this government spends too much families know how to budget we should be able to do the same thing families dont just get an automatic 4 6 percent increase in their budget we should look to hold the line on spending that is what this amendment does it will help set us on the path of fiscal discipline so we can begin to deal with the big problems that i referenced earlier that are going to be out there with entitlement spending and begin to get a handle on our budget so that our economy can continue to grow and prosper i reserve the balance of
