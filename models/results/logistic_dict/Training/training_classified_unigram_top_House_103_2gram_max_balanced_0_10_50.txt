straightforward it simply freezes spending for these programs at the current level under the democrat bill the spending would skyrocket from 388 million this year to 541 million in fiscal year 1994 and 1 billion in fiscal year 1995 my amendment would prevent this profligacy and save the taxpayers 800 million it was just a few short weeks ago that the democrats in this house passed a 5year budget plan which included the largest tax increase in american history we were told then by the democrat majority that this hefty contribution on the part of hard working taxpayers was necessary to reduce the federal budget deficit and here they propose increasing spending on corporate giveaway programs by 158 percent and what does h r 820 do under this bill the federal government is going to build an enormous network of technology centers so bureaucrats can show business men and women what machines to buy and how to run their businesses and the same people who gripe about socalled junk bonds are putting uncle sam in the venture capital business if you thought the s l crisis was bad wait until bureaucrats start making multimilliondollar commercial loans and finally the government is going to spend hundreds of millions each year picking winners and losers in the name of promoting technology here is what we are saying to the taxpayers today the government that brought you amtrak the post office the usda and 500 toilet seats at the pentagon is going to teach real entrepreneurs how to beat international competition the reason this bill is on the floor of course is that the majority believes that committees here in congress and the bureaucrats at the commerce department know how to run the economy as george will noted in a column 2 weeks ago the liberals in washington dc believe they know far more about competing in the marketplace than the undiscerning men and women who have risked their life savings to start a real business in the real world well let us take a look at what the democrat majority has already done for business this year it has heaped another mandate on workers and business in the form of mandated leave legislation it has passed a budget resolution which promises business higher energy and corporate income taxes the majority has promised the business community and the country another 5 years of huge budget deficits which will deprive the private sector access to capital but we have only just begun on the way is striker replacement and the rest of the big labor and trial lawyer agenda which will undermine americas competitiveness the finest illustration of the economic illiteracy of the majority is this the democrat party opposes indexing the capital gains taxwhich lowers the cost of capitalyet supports indexing the minimum wagewhich increases the cost of labor but the democrats are here to help business today they say the party that beleaguers business with higher taxes and regulations at every opportunity now wants to help the majority wants to promote economic growth and jobs through investment sounding ironically like supplyside onservativq republicans but as my friend jude wanniski says the majority is operating on the dark side of the supplyside modelinvesting in government bureaucracies instead of the private sector so as russia sweden mexico france poland and on and onmove away from state planning to emulate the american model of free enterprise the majoritywhile paying lipservice to the market seeks to move more and more resources from the productive private sector to the wasteful public sector if my democrat friends are genuinely interested in creating real jobs in the private sector they should consider this over the last 4 years the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent these small businesses create 76 percent of the new jobs in the economy if you want to help the entrepreneur lower his cost of capital stop tying his hands with unnecessary red and green tape do not raise his energy costs and corporate taxes reform americas legal liability laws amend antiquated antitrust law in short get the government off the backs of small business but do not burden all businesses with massive new taxes and regulations and then give away a billion dollars to the politically wellconnected that will not make america more competitive i would close with a quote from adam

least 800 per year in new taxes forcing every american family to tighten their belts yet these same democrats continue on their drunken spending spree refusing to cut their own budgets and even worse

opposition in the strongest terms to the proposal being offered today by bill clinton and the democrat majority in congress the budget proposal offered by the democrats is a recipe for economic and fiscal disaster it proposes to increase taxes at a time when americans are already overtaxed it proposes to increase taxes at a itime when we have a fragile economy higher taxes will only stifle job creation and economic growth it proposes to continue the path of excessive govemnment spending excessive spending is the reason our federal government is currently saddled with a massive debt depending on whose estimates you believe bill clinton is proposing to raise taxes anywhere from 250 billion to 315 billion no matter which figure you use if his proposal becomes law it will be the largest tax increase in the history of our nation moreover egardless of the exact figures his proposal taxes everyone from the small business owner to the social security recipient to the working middle income american family and we thought mr clinton was only going to sock it to the rich it is an absolute outrage that a man who actually promised middle american taxpayers a tax cut during the campaign can now turn around and unblushingly pr6pose to raise taxes in a magnitude of historic proportions mr clintons assertion that the reason he must now raise taxes is because the deficit figure is higherthan he anticipated during the campaign is quite frankly bull in fact last july during the campaign clinton predicted even higher deficitsup to 40u billionthan actually materialized moreover democrat budget committee members advising clinton during the campaign and working with their good friends at the congressional budget office certainly were well aware of what to expect in the way of deficit figures most conspicuous among those members is leon panetta former chairman of the housebudget committee and now clintons director of office of management and budget for clinton to rationalize raising taxes based on claims of new deficit figures is the height of hypocrisy this is just another example of mr clinton trying to be slick more importantly regardlessof what the actual deficit figures are t is excessive spending not insufficient tax revenues that has produced our gushing red ink indeed when you combine federal state and local taxes you find that the american taxpayer is already being taxed at alltime record high levels analyzing the federal budget over the past 12 years further drives home thepoint in 1980 revenues to the federal treasury were 500 billion by 1992 revenues had soared to 1 1 trillion a massive 600 billion increase in 12 years in other words in 12 years the american taxpayer shouldered an additional federal tax burden that was greater than the magnitude of the entire tax burden it took us over 200 years to reach one would think that the federal government could do just fine with 600 billion in new tax dollars each year but alas it isnt enough to quench the insatiable thirst of democrats in congress during that same timeframe federal expenditures rose frem 600 billion to nearly 1 4 trillionan increase of 800 billion this simply illustrates the historical fact that for every new dollar the treasury receives in taxes congress spends 1 60 more indeed the 1990 budget deal which had promised spending cuts for every dollar in new taxes instead resulted in congress spending an additional 2 37 for every dollar in new taxes republicans have been willing to make the hard choices and make the spendlng cuts how many times in the past 12 years have i seen this congress on a party ing vote reject republican amendments to trim as little as 1 percent from an appropriation bill how many times have i seen the democratcontrolled rules committee decide to prevent republlcant from offering amendments to cut spending and make economies indeed in that regard i was deeply disappointed that the democrats did not allow my good friend from indiana congressman dan burton to offer his budget freeze proposal i have long been an advocate of an across the board spending freeze mr burrons proposal would have made a bigger dent in the deficit than any of the proposals before us today moreover in my view mr burtons acrosstheboard freeze is the fairest way to spread the burden of spending cutseveryone who benefits from federal spending must tighten the belt however once again in an abuse of their uninterrupted control of the house of representatives for the past 40 years the democrats decided to gag the opposition rather than debate a viable alternative on its merits republicans have proposed viable alternatives and the budget proposal offered by my good fmlend john kasich is the kind of proposal that the american public deserves it proposes no tax increases and will cut the deficit significantly i can only hope that there are democrats in the house that can see the error of mr clintons ways and join republicans in supporting the kasich budget bill clinton has broken his promise to the american people as he has broken so many other promises in his short tenure mr clinton does not understad one

subject a little bit from an international issue to a domestic issue which is troubling me and troubling a lot of us from the state of california two years ago i came here as a former small business owner thinking that i could have a real opportunity to help this nations small businesses however i found out over the last 2 weeks that that is not necessarily true let me tell what happened the lkst 2 weeks several weeks ago i found out that sba a federal agency that is supposed to act as an advocate of small businesses spent over 100 000 of taxpayers money to promote employee mandates i was shocked that the sba would do such a thing especially since small business owners and employees overwhelmingly oppose employer mandates they are frightened for good reason every credible study predicts substantial job losses as a result of the employer mandates so i decided to offer an amendment which would change this ridiculous situation my amendment was simple it would prohibit the sba from spending taxpayer dollars to promote employer mandates the first thing i found out is that my amendment will not be allowed to be offered on the floor unless the rules committee approves the rules committee decides which amendments can and cannot be offered on the house floor for debate so i went to the rules committee to offer my amendment i thought that this was a simple amendment and that it should not have any problem being accepted when i walked into the rules committee i was surprised i found out something interesting there are nine democrats and only four republicans serving on that committee suddenly i had a bad feeling about my amendments chances sure enough the democratcontrolled rules committee rejected my amendment remember my amendment is simply asking sba not to spend taxpayers money to promote employer mandates it was simply rejected they said that the sba bill was not the appropriate place to debate health care issues despite the fact that my amendment dealt specifically with the sba and despite the fact that our own house parliamentarian ruled that my amendment was perfectly germane this ruling was obviously very unfair so i went to the house floor to try and overturn the rules committees decision and you can guess it i was defeated again even though 10 brave democrats stood up lid joined all of the republicans in voting to overturn this unfair decision my amendment again was blocked despite this defeat i was not willing to give up the fight for small businesses in fact i found out that i had one last chance to get a vote on my amendment i decided to offer a socalled motion to recommit which would have forced the house to debate and vote on my amendment just as i was preparing to offer my motion the democratic leadership removed the

amendment they are terrified that this body might actually pass my amendment and reveal the truth that the american people dont want employer mandates and being taken over by government small business people do not want employer mandates california people do not want employer mandates because they know that with employer mandates it is not a question of whether jobs will be lost it is just a question of how many jobs will be lost this is exactly why the american people are so frustrated with congress they are frustrated because instead of debating issues openly and honestly the democrat leadership of this body delays and hides behind parliamentary rules the american people are frustrated because instead of telling the truth about employer mandates the democratic leadership uses its dominance of the house to force members to toe the biggovernment line on health care reform the american people should know the democrat leadership is holding a bill hostage which would provide

threats during a time of shrinking defense dollars as president clinton said during his state of the union speech we must draw the line against further defense cuts though the fiscal atmosphere calls for tough decisions both the administration and the budget committee lave managed to retain a strong defense budget and stay within the discretionary spending caps taking an additional 2 4 billion out

meetglobal and regional threats to which threats will go unmet as the representative of the aerospace center of california i know what is at risk and it is not pork the balance achieved in the committee budget resolution reflects the tough budget choices we made last year enacting the largest deficit reduction package in historynearly 500 billion over 5 years included in that package was a proposal i coauthored with several of my colleagues to create a deficit reduction trust fund to ensure that net revenue increases and spending reductions included in the package go toward deficit reductionnot new spending this discipline has paid off the deficit is lower than it has been at any point in the 1990s we have a growing economy a falling jobless rate historically low interest rates and negligible inflation our direction is sound and the committee budget resolution keeps us on this fiscal path and keeps federal spending within the caps that the congress enacted last year in contrast to maintaining the balance the solomon and kasich alternative budgets compromise the investments we need to secure a productive future the solomon proposal cuts the technology development associated with the space station it cuts wastewater treatment land conservation job training education and law enforcement the kasich proposal cuts energy research including renewable energy research it cuts environmental cleanup civilian technology research transit student loans and high speed rail development and these are cuts beyond the substantial scaleback of discretionary spending under which we are now operating that is not to say that additional balanced deficit reduction cannot still be achieved during the coming months many of us will be fighting for specific cuts during the appropriations process we need further tools to ensure that those cuts stick that is why i have joined with a bipartisan group of colleagues in drafting a deficit reduction lock box this lock box will mandate that cuts made in appr6priations bills go to deficit reduction instead of simply freeing up the funds for future spending we need thelock box to mak sure that the deficit reduction momentum we

mistakes made and there have been some overruns made some of the mistakes are legitimate and deplorable but most of the mistakes and overruns were because of poor management models we correct that in this new redesign i have been pushing very hard to make one prime contractor in charge of building the space station to make one center instead of six in charge of building the space station to have one program director in chugs of building the space station we have that in the redesign in fact because of that management change we get a lot or most of the savings that are realized in the redesign also this is the first time that we have built a space station we are going to run into mistakes because it is the first time that we have built a space station it just makes logical sense that we are going to make some mistakes it has been said i think on this floor that there is a lack of science dan golden dr gibbons and many others have said that most of the science that the members voted for when they voted for space station freedom will be done on space station fteedomderved so we are going to get a little bit less science but if we are going to have these kinds of savings we have to give up some science but some very basic science some very real science in all kinds of areas will be done with this redesign to my colleagues on this side of the aisle and to the authors of the amendment that say we have to reduce the deficit i have the amendment right here i do not see anywhere in this amendment that says this savings is going to go to deficit reduction we know how this place works the freshmen that are against this listen up if the money is cut out of space station it is going to go somewhere else i serve on the subcommittee on va hud and independent agencies of the committee on appropriations and we can very easily and it will be take money from space station freedom and put over into hud or as the gentleman from ohio has said he has already made a list of things he wants to spend this money on medicare veterans benefits health insurance infrastructure we know where this money is going to go this ts going to go out of good basic science into warm fuzzy programs that they are all for that is why there will be no deficit reduction from this savings we know how this house works the choice is do we have a manned space program do we have exploration of

japanese i think it is signifidant there is something there about the difference between our relationship with japan and our relationship witlr mex ico i come from california and we californians of course all of us are from the southwest and there is a special relationship between mexico and the united states we feel that because we know that our part of the united states used to be part of mexico we haveso many citizens who are of mexican descent they are such an important part of our society and we are proud of our heritage mexicans they do not want to be just our neighbors they want to be our friends they literally want to be our friends perhaps the japanese when we are talking about trading agreenments with the japanese yes they believe in equality in trying to have some mutual benefit but it is not done in the same kind of spirit of friendship and understanding the mexicans understand well that they will always be the neighbors of the united states of america i think it is about time when we look at this debate that we keep that in mind no matter what happens they are always going to be our neighbors they are always going to be next door whether or not they are going to be friends whether or not the type of friendship that we have is going to be something that we can be proud of and whether we can march together into the future that iswhat we are going to make ot that neighborliness they are always going to be there this is perhaps something that i tried to tell the people in this hall because i am very aware of that they take all the good things that are happening in mexioo for granted right now if this treaty goes down this is the first administration that i have seen in mexioo in my lifetime where we did not have a government being run by someone who is viciously antiamerican because they would play on the fears just like some of our people here are playing on our fears of potential change with mexico they played on the fears of their people

rise today in strong support not just of the general agreement on tariffs and trade but also in recognition of the inventiveness and creativity that is the american genius which will be wellserved by gatt history tells us that when we are able to level the playing field and create equal opportunity in the international marketplace the united states does very well in 1970 exports represented 14 percent of our gross domestic product today that figure is 27 percent of our gross domestic product by 2005 just a little over 10 years from now exports will account for at least 36 percent of our gdp gatt will create jobs and opportunities in america and jobs remains my favorite fojrletter word there is a big downside to defeating gatt there is no question that it will send the wrong signal to the world capital and trade markets a message that says the united states is reverting to an isolationist mode that in the 1930s let to the great depression we do not want that we want to expand our markets and create more job opportunities gatt offers that very likely prospect three presidents starting with ronald reagan continuing with george bush and currently with bill clinton have embraced this agreement the bipartisan leadership in congress has done so as well gatt is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination there are some problems with it but the opportunities far outweigh tthe potential problems and even the potential problems can be dealt with im concerned about the possible effects of gait on dairy farmers but some opportunities lie immediately ahead to address this issue with dairy farmers just a few months from now we will begin working with dairy farmers on the reauthorization of the farm bill i am convinced that we will be able to address some of the concerns of the dairy community in that vehicle furthermore to those who suggest that were giving up our sovereignty i would quote speakertobe newt gingrich who told me this morning that simply is not so the new majority leader of the senate bob dole was very effective in negotiating an agreement with the administration that overcomes one of the concerns i had with the sovereignty issue and whether or not the united states would be treated fairly there is now a mechanism built into the legislative initiative under which 20 senators or 100 representatives either or could call for a vote on gatt at any time

shortsighted and in fact counterproductive to achieving the goals we all share the united states is the only nation that annually considers revoking mfn trade status for the prc in doing so we ignore the fact that foreign investors including united states companies have brought freemarket economics and new political ideas to some parts of the prc economy helping to raise the standard of living for many chinese and to expose them to our democratic and social ideals which foster political change denying mfn would hit hardest those areas of the nation that have moved most aggressively toward a market economy and are relative hotbeds of new political thinking china experienced double digit economic growth last year and was one of only two nations to experience any growth china is and will continue to be a critical market for united states manufacturing companies and it supports thousands of united states jobs should we pass this resolution our failure to supply airplanes or elevators to china will not create a shortage of these or any other products but will merely secure the place of foreign suppliers in the incredibly large and fastest growing market in the world inconsistent unitedstates policy already has allowed european manufacturers to take business from us by arguing that unitedstates companies are unreliable suppliers i remind my colleagues that over the past 5 years 80 percent of the growth in our gnp resulted from growth in exports our standard of living depends on successful exporting cutting ourselves off from the chinese market will effect our standard of living and at the jul 21 1993 0 same time diminish our ability to influence the very chinese policies we oppose since 1990 judicious congressional and presidential pressure has forced the prc to accept more change than would have otherwise occurred and supported the forces for change at a time when china faces inevitable significant turnover in her leadership in fact the pace of change in china is simply incredible not only have they changed the curriculum in their schools not only is there education every morning on the radio about how to be an entrepreneur but people are beginning to see their own personal futures differently and are behaving differently economically and politically when congressman archer and i traveled to china a few months ago we expressed concern directly to chinas leaders that they released political prisoners accept some of the moderate reforms proposed to open up their system address their growing trade imbalance with us and join the international effort to control the spread of nuclear arms assistant secretary of state for east asian affairs winston lord also visited china to express similar concerns as a result the prc government continues to take steps to release political prisoners address human rights issues of concern to all free nations and is more actively working with us on the issues of arms control and trade imbalances i believe slow progress will continue but a chi nas leadership changes new leaders will have a far better understanding of the international communities expectations and the pace of change will accelerate in the meantime it is critical that we continue to trade with china and maintain our presence in that country so that we can continue to affect economic social and political change i urge opposition to
