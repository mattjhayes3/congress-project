irresponsible budget resolution because it continues the reckless approach to fiscal policy that that the house majority championed for years with disastrous results i oppose the resolution before us because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose the resolution because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract in our america by turning medicaid into a block grant i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair we democrats have a better way we understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it beginning in 2024 all texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year the republican plan would reopen the donut hole forcing seniors to pay the full cost of their prescription drugs if their yearly drug expenses are more than 2 970 for the year seniors reaching the prescription drug donut hole would pay an average of 828 more in prescription drug costs in 2014 and approximately 13 000 more from now through 5 under the republican budget 2 445 462 texas seniors would be forced to pay for preventive health services by repealing health reform the republican plan will require that the 2 445 462 texas seniors who utilized free preventive services currently covered by medicare in 2012 will face increased costs in the form of higher deductibles coinsurance and copayments for certain services including even cancer screenings and annual wellness visits 6 the republican budget slashes 31 71 billion in nursing home care and other health care services for 754 500 texas seniors and disabled who currently rely on medicaid for their longterm care needs 7 the draconian cuts included in the republican budget would have a devastating impact on the 1 191 certified nursing homes in texas that serve 91 717 seniors with more than half relying on medicaid as their primary payer as a result nursing homes would be forced to slash services turn away seniors or close their doors mr chair this budget could have invested in programs that help strengthen the middle class reduce poverty and strengthen our economic recovery instead the republican budget makes deep cuts to the area of the budget helping lowincome families put food on the table and make ends meet these are families who are already struggling with unemployment lower wages and just simply trying to make ends meet the house republican budget will push millions more americans into poverty and put a large number of lowincome children seniors and people with disabilities at risk it guts medicare and medicaid and calls for massive cuts to food assistance all in order to protect tax breaks for special interests and for multimillionaires who are not even asking for them the republican budget may be characterized in many wayscruel irresponsible shortsighted recklessbut fair and balanced is not one of them in contrast the alternative budgets proposed by the democratic caucus congressional black caucus and congressional progressive caucus which were made in order by the rules committee are each worthy of support because they fairly balance the need for increased revenues and responsible reductions in expenditures with the imperative of making the necessary investments in human capital required to move our country forward specifically the alternative budgets proposed by the democratic caucus cbc and cpc help create more jobs now replace the sequester make key education investments invest in research and development and clean energy invest in longterm infrastructure preserve medicare as we know it protect health reforms benefits for seniors protect medicaid for seniors in nursing homes preserve supplemental nutrition assistance snap reduce the deficit through a smart targeted and steady approach provides tax relief for working families and ends tax breaks for the wealthy take a balanced approach to reducing the longterm deficits and debt and put the budget on a sustainable path mr chair under the democratic budget the deficit would fall from 7 percent of gdp in 2012 to under 3 percent of gdp by 2015 and to 2 4 percent of gdp in 2023 the balanced plan put forward by the democratic caucus will bring the budget into primary balance in 2017 and complete balance by around 2040about the same time as the house republican budget last year the democratic budget alternative will generate 1 2 million more jobs this year compared to the republicans austerity first plan by investing 200 billion in creating jobs upfront strengthening the middle class creating greater upward mobility and ensuring opportunity for our children and future generations included in the democratic proposal is 50 billion to fund jobs that address immediate surface transportation priorities and 10 billion to establish an infrastructure bank as well as tax incentives to support small businesses and manufacturing additionally the democratic budget immediately ends the sequester which would otherwise cost the economy 750 000 jobs by the end of the year and replaces it with deficit reduction resulting from a balanced approach combining responsible spending cuts with increased revenues by cutting tax breaks for special interests and wealthy individuals without increasing the tax burden on middleincome americans finally mr chair as a senior member of the committee on the judiciary let me note my disappointment that an amendment i offered which would have made this dreadful budget resolution a little less hurtful was not made in order by the committee on rules the jackson lee amendment to h con res 25 would put the congress on record in support of current funding levels for crime prevention grant programs administered by the department of justice the first and most important obligation of government is to ensure the safety of the people and nothing is more destabilizing to communities and inimical to job creation and economic growth than crime that is why it is counterproductive to cut investments in crime prevention under the guise of balancing a budget to spur economic growth it is said often mr chair but is no less true that the federal budget is more than a financial document it is an expression of the nations most cherished values as the late and great former senator and vicepresident hubert humphrey said the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the elderly and those who are in shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped for that reason that in evaluating the merits of a budget resolution it is not enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility to keep faith with the nations past to be fair to the nations present and to safeguard the nations future the budget must also pass a moral test the republican budget resolution fails both of these standards the democratic alternatives do not for these compelling reasons i

democratic whip task force on poverty and opportunity i rise today to continue talking about the ongoing crisis of poverty and the impact of sequester we are well aware of the impact the sequester is having on many many communities across the country in terms of devastating some of the basic social safety networks that we have all benefited from in many many ways theyre really very very harmful to our most vulnerable nearly 50 million americans including 16 million children all across our country and in every congressional district are living in poverty yet the sequester continues to have devastating impacts on access to childhood education affordable housing hot meals for lowincome seniors head start and countless other programs that help lowincome and vulnerable americans but these draconian cuts are not enough for some of my colleagues given what took place last night at the ag committee last night the ag committee passed a 20 billion cut to our nations first line of defense against hunger in the farm bill the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as the food stamp program is really a vital lifeline for millions of americans as a young single mother i relied on food stamps and public assistance during a very difficult period in my life let me tell you no oneno onewants to be on food stamps but it is a bridge over troubled water and so i am quite frankly appalled and very sad to see my colleagues attacking the integrity of such essential programs for families that need a helping hand during difficult times as we work to create hopefully a balanced reauthorization of the farm bill we must keep in mind the people the families and businesses impacted by these proposed cuts nearly half of all snap recipients are children one in five children in america are at risk of hunger and we know that nearly half of all children in america will be on snap benefits sometime during their childhood thats half of all children in america not only does snap help put food on the table for struggling families every 1 increase in snap benefits generates 1 70 in economic activity yet if the farm bill becomes law more than 2 million families will be cut off from this economic lifeline with unemployment still at 7 5 percentand in some communities its over 13 percentand the rate of poverty at 15 percentagain some communities its 27 to 30 percentongoing cuts to snap and other nutrition assistance programs will increase hunger in america and we will see even greater consequences hungry children cannot learn in school and suffer developmental delays hungry children have worse health outcomes hungry children have bleaker economic outlooks through the rest of their adult lives but the impacts dont stop there cuts to critical nutrition programs dont just hurt the hungry families who rely on them they hurt the economies of local communities as families have less money to spend in local stores allowing an increase in hunger across america will threaten our nations ability to develop the highly skilled and highly educated workforce that we will need to compete in the 21st century we must not make cuts on the backs of hungry children to balance our budgets doing so would be morally wrong and an economic disaster instead of scheduling a 37th vote to repeal the affordable care act we should come together to work to find an approach for all americans to help get everyone back to work we need a comprehensive solution to replace the sequester and to address the ongoing crisis of poverty that is why with the support of our democratic caucus we started a task force on poverty and opportunity in february which i am proud to chair we are working to build support for a comprehensive national strategy to help eliminate poverty grow the economy and create millions of new jobs and i urge all of my colleagues to join us i also hope that our colleagues will join myself representative jim mcgovern our congressional black caucus chair marcia fudge congresswoman jan schakowsky and our democratic caucus vice chair joe crowley in taking the food stamp challenge we need to raise the level of awareness

for a 155 billion increase in the deficit which they all say they want to bring down i am sure they will get up and rationalizeas they did in 1981 in 2001 and 2003that those tax cuts would magically grow the economy so that they would not exacerbate the deficit in the 33 years i have been in congress that has not been our experience so mr leader i very sincerely hope that we can join together in

place but not by doing violence to our children this body is so magnificent because it is so diverse we represent districts all over the country we represent people of different backgrounds all over the country but one thing among others that we certainly have in common is that each one of us have people in our districts who depend on the snap program for their nutrition there isnt one person in this room who could rise up and say nobody in my district relies on the nutrition programs that are in the farm bill chief among them are children seniors veterans and their families they are the real faces of hunger in america and their stories are the most compelling reason to reject this dangerous republican legislation in my district in san francisco people from all walks of life have relied on

recession took its toll on students across the country looking for work catlin found that she could not afford to pay rent and purchase food each month because she qualified for the emergency food

time volunteering at st anthonys dining room helping other people this is a place that helps other people to find food shelter clothes and compassion in our community there he gives back what little he has to the community wholeheartedly serving our seniors veterans children and families who also rely on the generosity of people like brian to feed themselves and their loved ones like brian and catlin millions of people across america are working hard and giving all they have to lift themselves up and help others get on their feet one of my colleagues said something like if you dont work you shouldnt eat something to that effect i hope i heard it incorrectly its really important to note that because of the low minimum wage in our country a family of four with both parents working full time and earning the minimum wage are below the poverty line they dont even come close to the 130 percent of poverty they are below the poverty line so in some respects the snap program is subsidizing a low minimum wage in our country as other support does as well i wish that we could respect how hard it is for a family of four with two people working full time not making enough money to put food on the table that we respect them for their struggle and for their concern for their families and not judge them that they dont have food on the table because our country has chosen to pay a subliving wage to so many people in our country the republican proposal on the floor today slashes the legs on which many of these people stand indeed cutting the investments is a full assault on the health and economic security of millions of families consider this one in five childrenit is soon becoming one in fourstruggle with hunger and nearly half of all snap recipients are children nearly 4 million

h r 4031 does not adequately address the performance metrics of va executives it doesnt provide any framework for ensuring problems and failures dont occur in the first place i introduced h r 4399 which the american legion also supports which establishes upfront organizational goals and expected outcomes for veterans that every single va senior leader must deliver it would require these goals and their outcomes to be the driving factor in performance assessment for these executives and the basis for any awards or bonuses this bill before us today does not address the senior physicians and dentists known as title 38 employees who receive executivelevel pay and have organizationallevel responsibility for veteran care and services this is important because one of the executives implicated in manipulating the wait times in phoenix was a title 38 employee which this bill does not cover that we are voting on today so the very individual responsible for the catastrophic failures that we have seen across the va recently may not even be impacted by the current legislation that we are dealing with my bill h r 4399 does address title 38 physicians and dentists which covers approximately 80 000 employees within the va title 38 employees mandating standardized rigorous performance management tools that hold employees accountable and justifies any performance pay finally my bill would prohibit one of the most egregious examples of the failure of the current system as it applies to title 38 employees a doctor was provided partial performance pay even though he had failed to maintain a current license that is correct he received partial performance pay even though he failed to maintain a current license because maintaining a valid license was not one of his performance objectives this bill that we are dealing with today does not address that issue good policy good legislation comes from conversation collaboration and compromise i am supporting moving this bill forward today because i believe we need to begin this discussion as how to best ensure va employees are held accountable when they fail to perform let me be clear we can and we must do more to ensure that our veterans get the quality services that they deserve and have earned i am hopeful that we can have the necessary dialogue in conference to ensure that any bill that we send to the president is a more comprehensive reform measure that is wellconsidered and actually has the desired and needed impact of changing the va and ensuring the best outcomes for our nations veterans i reserve the balance of

nation this allows cbp officers to screen and make admissibility decisions on individuals goods and baggage long before they ever leave a foreign port or could possibly become a threat to the homeland i myself have been screened as a part of preclearance operations in canada and ireland apparently these operations offer not only a convenience for travelers but also an effective and efficient way of carrying out security operations in fiscal year 2012 alone cbp officers and agriculture specialists precleared more than 1 5 million travelers destined to the united states to outright prohibit the expansion of this program to an area of the world where we know terrorists are actively traveling and training and seeking to carry out missions of harm against the homeland simply makes no sense whatsoever i understand many domestic airlines have expressed concern that this deal would somehow give uaebased airlines an upper hand but there are some facts that arent disputed and we simply should consider for one cbp has stated numerous times that access to abu dhabi for american carriers would be a precondition of implementing preclearance there secondly our bill provides statutory language that prohibits preclearance operations at new locations until three conditions are met the foreign and national security rationales have been provided to the congress a full cost analysis has been provided to the congress and an economic impact analysis of any new location on unitedstates airline carriers has been conducted and provided to the congress thats good language that will be good
