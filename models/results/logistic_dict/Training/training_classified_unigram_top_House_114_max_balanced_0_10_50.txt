our colleagues and we support each other in times of need i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries the gentleman from new york who is also host of this special order i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home

last 11 years walked away with the weapon that they went in to buy now in the wake of the horrific attacks in orlando congress must make it a priority to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of suspected terrorists there is bipartisan legislation that would prohibit those on the terrorist watch list from being able to purchase firearms in our country this bill is common sense if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun it is long past time for the republican leadership to bring that bill up for a vote we also need to pass my bipartisan bill to require background checks for all commercial gun sales background checks are our first line of defense when it comes to stopping dangerous people from getting firearms we know that background checks work every day they

background check by purchasing guns online or at a gun show this is a dangerous loophole that needs to be closed yesterday senate republicans blocked consideration of no fly no buy legislation and a

1644 under a structured rule making four amendments in order three from the democrats and one from the republicans h r 3662 under a closed rule and s j res 22 also under a closed rule like many americans i have grave concerns about the administrations nuclear agreement with iran since the agreements adoption in july iran has shown no goodwill or intention of improving its relationship with the west in many ways the iranian regime has increased its aggressive attitude toward the united states and our allies against u n security council resolutions the rogue nation has expanded its ballistic missile program testing two missiles as recently as last fall just on december 26 an iranian military ship fired a rocket near unitedstates and french military vessels in the persian gulf these incidents occurred just months before crippling international sanctions against the country are scheduled to be lifted further iran continues to be a state sponsor of terrorism a direct threat to our closest ally in the region israel continues rampant human rights abuses and continues the wrongful imprisonment of five american citizens president obama and senior administration officials have claimed that the nuclear agreement and lifting of economic sanctions which could return as much as 100 billion in frozen assets to tehran will help iran down a more moderate path however reality appears to show the contrary is occurring just weeks after the deal was signed supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei stated that we wont allow american political economic or cultural influence in iran and just last week the supreme leader told a gathering of prayer leaders that americans have set their eyes covetously on elections but the great and vigilant nation of iran will act contrary to the enemies will whether it be in elections or on other issues and as before will punch them in the mouth while president obama may find something positive in irans actions and statements i believe congress owes it to the american people to view iran with skepticism and concern h r 3662 the iran terror finance transparency act requires the president to certify that those individuals and entities receiving sanctions relief under the iranian nuclear deal are not involved in irans support for terrorism its human rights abuses or its ballistic missile program by passing this legislation congress can help ensure that the unitedstates will continue to sanction and deter terrorism and illegal ballistic missile tests within the state of iran in arguing for the nuclear deals adoption the president committed to congress and to the american people that our sanctions on iran for its support of terrorism its human rights abuses its ballistic missile program will continue to be fully enforced this legislation gives us the opportunity to hold the president to his word and conduct the necessary oversight to ensure that sanctions are enforced additionally this rule will provide for consideration of two other very critical measures that will help protect american businesses and families from the administrations regulatory overreach this rule provides for consideration of h r 1644 legislation that was drafted in response to the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcements ongoing rulemaking process that seeks to govern the interaction between surface mining operations and streams it is commonly referred to as the stream buffer zone rule in december 2008 the outgoing bush administration published its final stream buffer zone rule this rule was the product of over 5 years of deliberation extensive scientific research environmental analyses public comment and a concurrence from the environmental protection agency put simply this rule was developed the right way with transparency unbiased research scientific integrity stakeholder engagement and most importantly public involvement however shortly after the final 2008 rule was released several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the osm ultimately leading to a settlement agreement between osm and the environmental groups after numerous missed deadlines the environmental organizations renewed the litigation the administration agreed with the complaint as a result the court vacated the 2008 rule and osm subsequently restarted the rulemaking process since that time the entire process has lacked transparency oversight conducted by the house committee on natural resources of which i am a member revealed that the settlement agreements expedited timeframe coupled with an inexperienced contractor and gross mismanagement of the rulemaking process resulted in major issues with the administrations rule now this may sound just a little familiar it is the very same sue and settle practice that the house addressed just last week with the passage of h r 712 the sunshine for regulatory decrees and settlements act the outcome is another example of why sue and settle leads to poor rulemakings and onerous regulations that significantly harm the people businesses and jobs they are supposed to be supporting backroom deals between environmental groups and federal agencies do not lead to sound regulations but instead circumvent the rulemaking process to serve the interest of a select few namely special interests and environmental groups for 6 years osm has been rewriting this rule and the ongoing process has now cost the taxpayers over 10 million though this is only a small fraction of the cost it will have on businesses and hardworking american families the stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access to coal which accounts for nearly half of our countrys electricity leading to higher electricity costs and significant job losses according to a study from the national mining association the number of direct mining jobs that could be lost is between 40 000 and 77 000 and the total job losses is between 112 000 and 280 000 a fact that is underscored by the nations second largest oil company arch coal filing for bankruptcy largely due to the increased cost of federal regulations that happened just this week for these reasons it is imperative that we pass h r 1644 legislation that delays the rules implementation increases scientific transparency for rulemakings affecting mining directs a transparent third party to evaluate the existing stream buffer zone rule and reduces duplicative regulation this rule also makes in order legislation dealing with an issue that i hear about very often in my congressional district it strikes the controversial waters of the united states or wotus rule s j res 22 is a resolution of disapproval of the presidents wotus rule that was passed by the senate in bipartisan fashion and it is now time for the house to consider and pass this important measure this legislation was crafted in response to the wotus rule promulgated by the epa and the army corps of engineers which redefines and vastly expands the scope of water subject to federal jurisdiction under the clean water act by issuing this rule these agencies have given themselves broad new power over water and land across the united states like many of my constituents i am very concerned with this massive federal overreach it goes far beyond the agencies statutory authority and could impose significant costs not only on american farmers and small businesses but on states and local governments the rule is another federal power grab that has more to do with controlling land use decisions than protecting access to clean water s j res 22 utilizes the congressional review act to block this harmful regulation and it is time to send this critical measure to the presidents desk i urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation and the rule providing for its consideration the rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of three bills that are critically important for the future of this country we must pass h r 1644

of transportation determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the traveling public and that the state or local agency has made a good faith effort to improve the performance of the hov lane the secretary may require the public authority to take additional actions to improve the hov lane the current hov degradation standard requires hov lanes to maintain an average speed above 45 miles per hour 90 percent of the time during peak hours i repeat during peak hours this arbitrary standard does not take into consideration or account the specific transportation concerns of each state over 60 percent of californias highways are noncompliant by this federal degradation standard which means that california will be forced to spend limited resources on transportation projects that do not meet the needs of the general public california will also have to reduce the amount of energyefficient vehicles that it allows in the hov lane in california we have studied the issue and have found that they do not meet the minimum driving speed standard because of accidents weather events and other unpredictable events the degradation standard is supposed to address manageable recurring congestion but california is noncompliant in the standard based on manageable traffic events this amendment would allow the dot to recognize that there are special circumstances in each state that

unfairly disadvantaged indian tribes in western oregon after signing many treaties with the tribes the united states removed them from their original homelands and put them on only two reservations established to house potentially more than 60 tribal governments in 1954 congress made things worse all tribes west of the cascades lost federal recognition when the western oregon termination act became law scholars called it the termination era it was terrible federal indian policy it was so bad that it was formally rebuked by congress less than 30 years later in the 1970s congress began the process of restoring the western oregon tribes to federal recognition cleaning up the mess and injustice the united states had made in fact i began my congressional career as an original sponsor of

themselves effectively unlike many tribes the coos lower umpqua and siuslaw as well as the cow creek are deprived of any land held in trust unlike any other tribe in the united states the coquille

office of science it eliminates a very poorly designed setaside that is based on spending that is completely unrelated to the actual office of science if the goal of this program were to equalize the funding in the office of science then it should be based on the actual expenditures of the office of science so that states that are underrepresented there would presumably be able to qualify for these it does not do that if it were designed to equalize the spending between states that receive a lot more federal funding than those that dont then you would see a very different set of states in this particularly the fact that it is not based on a per capita basis is the fundamental flaw in this thing if you look at those states the single distinguishing characteristic is not that they are poor or rural or anything else it is that they have small populations which means that they are overrepresented in the senate one of the main mechanisms for transferring wealth out of large states like new jersey like illinois like california and a large number of other states into smaller states are spending formulas that have frankly been cooked up in the senate where small states are overrepresented and the formulas steer large amounts of money into them if this were based on a per capita basis it would at least be rational if the office of sciences funding were based on actual expenditures at least in the department of energy it would be rational what we see are states receiving epscor funds that get far more than their share both in federal funding and in department of energy funding overall a rational program would first off collect all research funding in all areas and base the setasides on that secondly it would do it on a per capita basis these are fundamental flaws and at this point it is preferable to just eliminate the entire program and start over if people think it is a useful thing i urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment mr chair i
