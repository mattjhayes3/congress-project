the men women and children who have been exposrd to this highly toxic chemical we b aieve the government has a responsibility to these veterans and finally we believe that compensation should begin as soon as possible unless the government can prove in fact that these disabilities were not caused by exposure to herbicides the vietnam veterans did not ask the government to give them more time when
