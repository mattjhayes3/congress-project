been made out here in the last 3 years because it is significant and it really brings us to the question of what next we came here many of us came here out of the private sector with no political background myself included and we came here in1995 set on the idea that it was our responsibility to do something about the deficit to get us to a point where this government spent no more money than it brought in to get us to do something about the high tax rates in this country and we were very concerned about social security and medicare as it related to our senior citizens it has been a great day in washington because today we actually introduced a bill that deals with the next step and in order to deal with the next step that is paying down some of that debt you first have to recognize we are in the third year of a 7year plan to balance the budget we are on track and ahead of schedule medicare has been restored so our senior citizens can rest assured that medicare is safe for at least another decade and good news for virtually every american all over this country taxes are coming down we have got a 500 per child tax credit coming through if you own stocks or bonds or have a retirement fund of any sort the capital gains tax reduction will affect you and allow you to keep more of your own money instead of sending it to washington the death taxes are coming down and of course there is all sorts of other tax provisions in there the 1 500 if you have got a student in college right now the 1 500 to help you get that student through college but the good news and we will see more of this as we go forward this evening is there are more tax cuts coming in the plan the logical next step is to talk about paying down the debt and before i get into this i think it is real important we pause and just make sure that we talk a little bit about the difference between the deficit and the debt every year since 1969 the federal government has been spending more money than what ithas in its checkbook it is not a lot different than our home in our home we have income we get a paycheck every month or every week depending on what kind of setup you have but at any rate you get a paycheck you put it in your checkbook and you write out checks to pay your bills well in your home you cannot write out checks for more than is in your checkbook or of course the checks are going to bounce well what the federal government has been doing since 1969 is collecting taxes putting those tax dollars that they take out of your pocket into the government checkbook and then writing out all kinds of checks the problem in the government is it is very different than in our homes when the government writes these checks out they write out checks for more than what is irl their checkbook that is called the deficit since 1969 every year the government takes money out of your pockets puts it in their checkbook and then writes out checks for more money than they have in the checkbook that is the deficit well what happens with that deficit since their checkbook is overdrawn they really only have one thing that they can do they go and borrow the money to put in their checkbook and here is what has happened over the course of the last few years from 1960 to 1980 the growth of the debt was fairly small but from 1984 forward you can see that government has been overdrawing their checkbook by a substantial amount so what happens well in the year 1980 for example they wrote out more checks than what they had in their checkbook and they borrowed the money and the debt started growing by 1985 you can see the debt was growing more and more and every year they kept writing out more checks than what they had money intheir checkbook and the debt just kept growing now i point to this chart because it is about the best picture that i have seen to show just how serious this problem of debt is because every year when they go out and borrow that money to make their checkbooks solvent of course it just gets added on to the debt to show you how serious this problem is we are currently about here on this debt chart it is a very very serious problem facing this country now when washington tells the american people that they are about to balance the budget what that actually means is they are going to quit spending more money than they have in their checkbook now most americans would ask the same question they do in wisconsin they would ask the question well if you balance your checkbook that is you stop spending more money than you have in your checkbook what about that debt that is still out there and i should show just how big that number is that we actually put a number to it as we would in our own homes with our own checkbooks the debt the amount of money that the government has overdrawn their checkbook by in 1969 they borrowed it and then in 1970 they borrowed some more 1971 and all the way through to and including this year that debt adds up to 5 3 trillion the number looks like this but let me translate that into english it is effectively the same as 20 000 for every man woman and child in the united states of america again this is the debt this is the amount of money they have actually borrowed this is the money that we will pass on to our children if we do not do something about it another way of looking at this is for a family of five like mine the federal government has actually borrowed 100 000 basically over the last 15 years put another way the federal government spent 100 000 more than what it took in in taxes from an average family of five like mine and here is the real problem with that a lot of people in this community would like to say well do not worry about the debt it is no big deal it will go away but here is the real problem the real problem is that an average family of five in america today sends a check for 580 every month to washington d c to do nothing but pay the intereston the federal debt now the families out there should be thinking about well what could we do if we did not have that debt well you would keep the 580 in your own pocket and a lot of them are going well i do not know what he is talking about because i do not really pay 580 in income taxes but i would like to point out that when you walk in a store and you buy a loaf of bread and the store owner makes a small profit on the loaf of bread part of that profit gets sent out here to washington in the form of a tax and that is part of the 580 a month that our families are paying in interest on this federal debt so again there are 2 different topics here one is the deficit the deficit is the amount that the federal government overdraws their checkbook by every year when the people in washington talk about balancing the budget what they are talking about is their checkbook they are talking about stopping the practice of spending more money than they have in their checkbook every year well what that means is after we balance the budget we have still got this 5 3 trillion debt hanging over our head now i started this evening by saying it is a wonderful night tonight because today we introduced a piece of legislation that goes to the what next the what next of course is what do we do about this 5 3 trillion debt do we pass it on to our children and i am talking some flack over this bill to be perfectly frank were you we had a former vice presidential candidate that said that we do not have to worry about the debt in fact jack kemp said that the debt will take care of itself over a long period of time and we really do not need to worry about paying the debt back when we start running surpluses that is when we start collecting more taxes than what we write out checks why do we not just do all tax cuts and not worry about this debt well i want to tell you there is two gentlemen and we are not allowed to show them here because of house rules on the floor here with me this evening my son is here and the reason we cannot look the other way is because it is not acceptable for us in our generation to pass this 5 3 trillion debt on to our children is it really fair that our generation spend this money and look the other way and say well lets hope it takes care of itself or do you think we more have a responsibility to do something about the debt much like any homeowner would do with any debt against their home the bill we introduce today is much like repaying a home loan it is much like any family in america would do where you simply start making payments on the debt and over a 30year period of time we repay the federal debt here is what the bill does after we reach a balanced budget we cap the growth of government spending 1 percent below the rate of revenue growth that creates a surplus because if you are in balance to start with spending goes up by one amount a little bit less then revenues go up that creates a surplus that surplus we take twothirds and we apply it toward paying down the federal debt we take onethird and supply additional tax cuts to the american people well 2 things happen under this bill actually 3 things one is there are additional tax cuts for the american people but 2 other very significant things happen the first and what i consider to be the most important we pass this nation on to our children debt free by the year 2026 under our plan the federal debt is repaid in its entirety again by 2026 the debt could be repaid in its entirety under this plan the other thing that happens is equally significant today we collect more dollars in the social security then what we pay back out to seniors in benefits that money is supposed to be sitting here in a savings account someplace well it is not here and i do not think this is any big surprise to anyone the money has been spent on other washington programs and in fact the social security trust fund is all part of this 5 3 trillion debt as we pay back the federal debt the second thing that happens is we put the money back into the social security trust fund that has been taken out so our senior citizens can again be assured that social security is solvent at least to the year 2026 so this bill really has something in it for all generations to the young people they will not have to make that 580 a month payment to washington to do nothing but pay the interest on this debt instead they can keep that money in their own homes for their own families and decide how to best spend their own money that is what this should be all about so to the young people they get a debtfree nation what a wonderful opportunity that is in this bill for the people that are working today onethird of those surpluses are dedicated to additional tax cuts for working families in america today so the good news is for people in the work force taxes go down some more for our senior citizens the social security trust fund the money that has been taken out by the washington bureaucrats and spent on all kinds of other programs that money gets put back into the social security trust fund and social security once again becomes solvent for our senior citizens a good day in washington a good day in washington is where we can introduce a bill that actually talks about paying off the federal debt lowering taxes and restoring the social security trust fund that is what happened today what kind of support do we have on this let me start with the members of congress in the house of representatives we have roughly 100 sponsors from both sides of the aisle i am happy to say there are democrat cosponsors in this as well as republican in the house we have people such as speaker gingrich the gentleman from georgia mr newt gingrich is a cosponsor of the bill the chairman of the committee on appropriations the gentleman from louisiana mr bob livingston a cosponsor of the bill the chairman of the committee on the budget the gentleman from ohio mr john kasich a cosponsor of the bill the honorable chairman of the committee on rules the gentleman from new york mr jerry solomon a cosponsor of the bill the gentleman from new york mr bill paxon a cosponsor of the bill 100 cosponsors in the house of representatives already on this idea it goes beyond that it goes beyond that we had an interesting conversation think about this range of support from the speaker the gentleman from georgia mr newt gingrich to the conversation i had yesterday with a wellknown american citizen ross perot we are going to see ross perot tomorrow and present the rest of the details of the plan in person to him but he is very optimistic and very supportive of the plan because of course it does what he talked about doing for the last 5 7 8 10 years and that is balancing the budget and paying off the federal debt so we have a wide range of support for this it goes beyond that two hundred fifty thousand members of capitol watch have signed off as endorsing the plan united senior citizens association let me see what they say about it since its inception the united senior citizens association has lobbied congress to restore the stability of the social security trust fund the introduction of the national debt repayment act is a step toward making social security solvent the council for government reform on behalf of over 250 000 members of the council for government reform i urge you to cosponsor and support mark neumanns legislation entitled the national debt repayment act coalitions for america coalitionsfor america supports the national debt repayment act of 1997 we do so for the simple reason that your bill sheds some sadly needed light into the tremendous load of red ink america is drowning under businessindustrial council on behalf of 1 000 member companies the unitedstates business and industrial council usbic i would like to extend our support for the national debt repayment act of 1997 the gentleman from georgia mr newt gingrich in a press release strongly supporting it the debt repayment act takes us in exactly the right direction to lead a national dialogue on how to best deal with the surpluses once the budget is balanced i can keep going on this but the bottom line is the support for this thing and the range of support from republicans to democrats from the speaker of the house to ross perot the support for this particular idea grows because it is a commonsense straightforward approach for this great nation we live in what a dream for america what a dream for this great country a balanced budget lower taxes medicare restored and now the next step we pay off the debt so our children can get this nation debt free we restore the social security trust fund so it becomes solvent again and we continue the process of reducing the tax burden on working families in america what a dream for this great nation we live in i would like to next go to a little bit about what has been happening before 1995 what has happened from 1995 to today and then how we can get to the point where this bill is actually put into place and actually used to begin this discussion i want to start with the past i have to say that the past is before i was actively involved in politics before 1990 i was never in politics i was working very hard building a business out in wisconsin we built the business from the ground up in the end we were providing about 250 job opportunities in southeastern wisconsin and in northern illinois what was going on out here in washington is that people in washington were making a series of promises to the american people and they kept getting broken that is what drove many of us out of the private sector and with a concern for our children and future generations of this great nation we left the private sector to serve our country for a period of time undo what was done in those broken promises hopefully straighten this out and then return back to the private sector let us look at the promises let us think back to before 1995 this is the past this is before the american people basically provided the impetus or the revolt if you like of what was going on they did that in 1994 let us go back before then and talk about what was promised in the late 1980s and early 1990s i have up here the grammrudmanhollings act this blue line shows how they promised they were going to get to a balanced budget notice it reaches zero in 1991 that is to say they promised the american people they would balance the budget by 1991 i watched this thing from its inception only when they promised it was going to get balanced instead what happened is this red line that is the deficit line that is how much they overdrew their checkbook by i was out there working hard to run a business make sure those 250 people got paid every week and i was watching washington overdraw their checkbook every week it was very frustrating to watch when they made this promise and then broke it they overdrew their checkbook by even more than they said they were going to many americans kot very angry at this situation as they felt threatened for the future of our country i do not care what anybody in this community says the american people do care about this country they care about what kind of a country we are going to pass on to our children so they saw they could not live up to what they had promised in 1985 and they put a new plan into place they called it the grammrudmanhollings act of 1987 this one provided another blue line another series of promises it was supposed to be balanced in the early 1990s but instead of following their promise again they broke it and overdrew their checkbook by massive amounts of money this is what led to the 1994 if you would like i would call it an uprising of the american people it was not a revolt in washington it was the american people saying we are sick and tired of these people making promises to us out there in washington we are sick and tired of those promises that were broken at this point i might add that the democrats were in control of both the house of representatives and the senate and the presidency they said we are sick and tired of those broken promises so we got to 1993 this was going on in 1993 they said well we had better get serious about this our checkbook is really overdrawn the people that were in washington in 1993 said well the only thing we know to do to balance our checkbook is to reach into the pockets of the american people and take out more money that was the tax increase of 1993 broken promises and higher taxes that is before 1995 that is before the american people sent a new group to washington to change these broken promises and higher taxes i would hope all of my colleagues take a moment tonight to remember the tax increases of 1993 because we need to remember what that environment was back in 1993 the broken promises and the higher taxes to understand just how far we have come in the last 3 years remember in 1993 they raised gasoline taxes they raised social security taxes the biggest tax increase in history and there was a huge fight out here in washington as a matter of fact they passed the bill by one single solitary vote in the house of representatives and not a single republican would vote for the tax increase so it went over to the senate in the senate they again passed it by one single solitary vote the biggest tax increase in american history and it passed both houses by one single vote and was of course then signed into law by the president what was the result the result was the american people said i am sick and tired of these promises being broken i am sick and tired of the people in washington thinking that the right solution to their spending habits is to reach into the pockets of the american people and take more money out to washington we have had it with that so in 1994 they elected a new group of people and sent them on out here to washington again i would emphasize that at that point the house of representatives was taken control of by a new party by the republican party the senate also was taken over by the republican party at that point but it is not the party difference that is important here it is the change in what was happening and the concept of the way to solve the problem of balancing the budget reaching into the pockets of the people and taking more money out to washington or the very different view that was brought in in the different view went like this instead of reaching in the pockets of the american people and taking more money out here to washington so we can maintain big government instead of doing that what we are going to do is curtail the growth of government spending when we curtail the growth of government spending since the government spends less that means they will not need as much money out of the pockets of the american people when they spend less of course they are going to borrow less here was the theory if the government borrowed less money out of the private sector that would mean there would be more money available in the private sector more money available in the private sector would keep the interest rates down and when the interest rates stayed down people would probably buy more houses and cars because they could afford them when they bought more houses and cars people would have to go to work building those houses and cars of course when they went to work they were leaving the welfare rolls and went into the work force i have good news we have now moved out of the past and into the present our motto was put into place in 1995 the american people deserve the credit for this the american people sent a new group to washington that new group sent to washington with their ideas of curtailing the growth of government spending have laid this down and now we are in the third year of this the american people have every right in the world they should be checking us they should now be asking the question is this group that we put in charge in 1995 doing anything different than what the people did before them the broken promises of grammrudmanhollings is there anything different going on i brought a chart along to help see just how different it really is out here in 1995 we promised the american people a balanced budget by the year 2002 we laid out the deficit stream just like they did with grammrudmanhollings in the first year we promised the deficit would be below this red column below 154 billion the deficit in the first year was actually 107 billion here is what was promised that is the red column here is what the deficit actually was please note the deficit that actually occurred was smaller than what was promised to the american people we not only hit the target but we were ahead of schedule the second year we said it would be under 174 billion it is actually now well under 67 in the second year of this plan again the promises the red column and the blue column is what actually happened conceptually the idea of controlling the growth of government spending worked the idea of the government borrowing less money and leaving more available in the private sector keeping the interest rates down so people would buy more houses and cars providing more job opportunities it worked we are now in the third year of that plan and again in the third year we are not only on track but ahead of schedule that is the debate going on in washington today we are well ahead of schedule to be to a balanced budget by the year 2002 has anything changed i would like to point out that under the grammrudmanhollings they never hit the targets under the new group that is here since 1995 we have not only hit the targets but we are ahead of schedule in the first year we not only hit the target but we are ahead of schedule in the second year we not only hit the target we are ahead of schedule in the third year the good news for the american people is that we may very well have a balanced budget by next year we are so far ahead of schedule on our plan because the idea of the government borrowing less keeping the interest rates down so people can afford to buy houses and cars and provide job opportunities that working model of 1995 worked so well that we are probably going to have a balanced budget by the year 1998 that is great news for the american people a lot of people cannot figure out exactly how this happened i brought another chart along to help show what this curtailing the growth of government spending really means before 1995 the average growth of spending under the old regime was 5 2 percent annually i went back 7 years and took the average growth in spending of the 7 years before the 1995 group took over before the american people put the republicans in charge of the house and senate since then spending is still going up by 3 2 percent but the growth of government spending in washington has been slowed by 40 percent in 2 short years this is how fast it was going up before 1995 this is how fast it is now going up after 1995 if spending still going up or are we making draconian cuts that virtually every american has been told about i have news there are no draconian cuts spending in government is still going up by 3 2 percent a year government is still getting bigger and a lot of us do not like that a lot of us would prefer to see this number at zero government does not need to be bigger cut out the waste and get down to the programs that people actually need but the facts are government spending is still going up by 3 2 percent a year if we look at inflation in adjusted dollars it is going up by about 6 percent per year if we take a look at what is really happening to government spending it was going up in real dollars by 1 8 percent a year it is now still going up by about 6 percent that is after inflation government unfortunately is still getting bigger so we have plenty of room to move this plan forward to the next step and stop government from growing at all but at this point what has been done is the growth of government spending has been slowed it is the slowing of that growth of government spending that has led us to a point where we can actually both balance the budget probably by 1998 or 1999 well ahead of schedule and reduce taxes on the american people at the same time what a wonderful situation this is and what great news this is for america instead of in 1993 talking about higher taxes we have in fact curtailed the growth of government spending to a point where we can both balance the federal budget and at the same time provide tax relief for the americgn people it is good news for america that is what i said when i started this evening it is a great day in washington and there are not a lot of great days in washington believe me but it is a great day because we know that what has been tried in 1995 that model that was put into place we know that model actually works and it is very very important i have one more thing here that shows just how important the work that has been done is and credit for this should go to a lot of the different leadership in both houses for this but most important to the american people because after all it is the american people that had the common sense in 1994 to change what was happening in this community it would not have changed without the american people it cannot change without the support of the american people what this chart shows is where the deficit was headed if the group that came here in 1995 played golf and basketball instead of doing their job this line shows where the deficit was headed when we got here in 1995 the yellow line shows how much progress was made in the first 12 months under a new party in control my colleagues will notice that the deficit projections came down but they still were not going to zero at that point the green line is the 1995 plan that we put into place and the blue line this is the good news the blue line shows us what is actually happening again here is what would have happened here is how much progress was made in 12 months here is our plan this is what we hope for this is like the grammrudmanhollings promise to the american people and here is what is actually going on we are not only on track in our plan we are ahead of schedule to the point where the budget will probably be balanced next year or the year after and we can provide a tax reduction to the american people i have got to pause for a moment in this presentation and say i have been upbeat very positive about where we are going with this country and very positive about the possibilities for what can happen i want to pause for just 1 minute and make sure we have a dose of reality in here this is a topic that i think is very important for all americans to understand whether they are in their thirties or forties or fifties and thinking about at some point receiving social security or whether they are in their fifties and sixties and are nearly ready to start receiving social security or whether they are 65 or 62 and over and are receiving social security this is a very important thing to understand when washington says they are going to balance the budget what they do not tell the american people is they are still taking money out of the social security trust fund to do it let me explain that every year the social security trust fund takes money in out of the paychecks of the american people it takes in more money than what it gives back to the seniors in checks that is to say there is a surplus they are collecting more money the reason for that is very simple the baby boom generation is moving toward retirement and when the baby boom generation gets there there will not be enough money to pay social security that happens in 2001 so they are collecting more money than what they are paying out right now the idea is that money gets set aside in a savings account and the savings account then provides the money in 2012 when the baby boom generation starts retiring and there is not enough money there to write out the social security checks the only problem in washington this should come as no big surprise to anyone when washington saw that extra money being collected out of the paychecks instead of putting it aside in a savings account they spent the money they put it in their big government checkbook and spent the money so at this point the only thing we have in that savings account is a bunch of ious it is all part of the 5 trillion debt so when washington says they are going to balance the budget it is important to understand that what they actually mean is they are going to use that social security trust fund money to actually count toward their checkbook and call that balanced again i have a picture here to help make that clearer the surplus in the social security trust fund for 1996 was about 107 billion so they have got this extra money coming in about 100 billion extra coming in when they say balance the budget what they mean is i am sorry the deficit was 107 billion in 1996 on top of that there was 65 billion in the surplus social security money so there was 65 billion extra came in to social security more than what they paid out the deficit had originally been reported as 107 billion the true deficit then 172 billion when washington says they are going to balance the budget what they really mean is they are going to zero out this blue area so even after they zero out this blue area that is the deficit what they call the deficit out here they are still using the social security trust fund money to make their checkbook look balanced so in 2002 or whenever we hit a balanced budget and washington proclaims victory we need to understand that that victory still means they are using the money out of the social security trust fund that leads us again to the national debt repayment act and why it is so important under the national debt repayment act of course what we would do is after we balanced the budget we would cap the growth of government spending at a rate 1 percent lower than the rate of revenue growth so as to create a surplus that surplus is what we use to put the money back in the social security trust fund that has been taken out so over a period of time then when we get to a true balanced budget that is we get to a point where we are not using that social security money to mask the true size of the deficit or to make the budget look like it is balanced when it is really not we get past that in our national debt repayment act and we actually get to a point where all of this money that has been taken out of the social security trust fund gets put back in if that happens social security again becomes solvent through the year 2029 i want to talk again we talked about the past and the present i want to go again into the future because understanding the problems in the social security trust fund and understanding how significant this debt is on our children and what it means to them and how much interest they would have to pay or how much they do not have to pay so they can keep the money in their own home a lot of folks are talking about our budget plan as being pieinthesky we cannot really balance the budget i put together a little chart that looked at the average federal revenue growth over the last 3 years revenue to the federal government that is if we just look at how much money is coming in to washington it has been growing by 7 3 percent average over the last 3 years over the last 5 years it went up by 7 3 percent a 10year average is 6 2 percent a 17year average is 6 8 percent in our budget resolution in the budget plan that balances the budget by 2002 we only projected revenue growth of 4 percent that is to say the plan we laid on the table was extremely conservative the reason there are projections out there that the budget will be balanced in 1998 or 1999 is because revenue is in fact growing even faster than the 4percent number when it grows faster of course that gets us closer to a balanced budget i put together a little table i asked the question what if revenue grows at a more historical level say 6 percent that is what this chart shows if we can hold the spending in line as we have been doing and meet the spending targets that are in the budget resolution that has just passed and revenue grows by 6 percent instead of the 4 percent still lower than it has been growing but faster than what was projected in the budget resolution what happens is we do in fact balance the budget by the year 2000 and start running a surplus that is the real importance of passing the national debt repayment act these surpluses could start as soon as 1999 or 2000 and when those surpluses start there is going to be a frenzy in washington dc with a strong desire to spend more of the american peoples money by passing the national debt repayment act we would assure that twothirds of this surplus goes to repaying the debt including paying off the social security trust fund and that onethird of this surplus is provided for additional tax cuts to the american people that is what the national debt repayment act is about it was introduced today and i would strongly encourage my colleagues to be actively involved in supporting it and equally important i think the american people need to get actively involved in this because inside the beltway there is this strong sense that somehow the debt is irrelevant it is almost like we do not care if we pass it on to the children we want to give more tax cuts because that will be politically popular i deep down inside believe that the american people understand that the right and proper thing to do the morally and ethically right thing to do is to pay the bills that we ran up over the last 15 years the national debt repayment act will allow us to do just that before people in my age group leave the work force we would have the debt repaid in its entirety for the people who want more tax cuts i would just pe nt out that as we pay off the federal debt as we implement this sort of a plan the interest payments to the federal government will be reduced and when we reduce those interest payments of course taxes can be correspondingly held down there are two important things in order to bring all of this about there are two very important things one of them is that we curtail the growth we continue curtailing the growth of government spending we do not have to have draconian cuts we do not have to wipe out all kinds of programs that are important to people what we do have to do is we have to curtail the growth of government spending that may mean that a program gets killed on one side that was wasteful or not as productive or not as important as another program someplace else if we were to say limit the growth of government to the rate of inflation some program might grow faster than inflation such as medicare some other program might have to grow slower than the rate of inflation i would point to one of these last year we sent 35 million to russia so russia could launch monkeys into space i do not think we needed to send that 35 million we took 35 million of the taxpayers money we sent the money to russia for the russians to launch monkeys into space for research those things should be eliminated the dollars spent on those sorts of programs should be redirected to programs that are more important say medicare for example and that should allow us to keep the growth of government spending at the inflation rate or even lower the beauty of this whole idea the national debt repayment act is that we have onethird of the surplus going to additional tax cuts twothirds going to repay the debt we get to pay off the entire debt by the year 2026 and give this nation to our children debt free the social security trust fund is restored and we get to provide additional tax cuts to the american people i cannot think of much better that we could spend our time and effort on i cannot think of a better vision for the future of this great country i have got a few minutes left tonight i would like to jump over into another topic that i think is very important out here i would like to go into a little more detail on the tax cuts that are coming for the american people there is a lot of debate in this community right now about whether people who are not paying any income taxes should get a tax cut or not many of us feel that if a person is not paying taxes it is probably pretty hard to get a tax cut there is a debate about whether the social security taxes that are withheld out of a paycheck should be applied or not i guess that debate will go on but the bottom line is when it is all over and done with people with children families with children with incomes below 110 000 a year or 75 000 if they are single they get 500 per child back in their home if they are in a house where they have got one child headed off to college and two kids in school yet they will get 500 for each one of those kids on top of that for the one that went off to college they will get an additional 1 500 this is not like they get from washington this is their hardearned money that instead of sending it out here to washington to let washington decide how to spend it they get to keep this money in their own home and spend it in the way that they think is most desirable for their own family i was talking to a family with three children in church the other day they said to me the first thing i am going to do with this money 500perchild i am not going to go and spend that money thatis going into a college fund for my kids so i know when they get there and i will have three in college at that point i know when they get there we can pay the college bills what a great statement that is for america american families care this country is not dead and gone the people of this country care not only about the country they care about their family when the 500perchild tax cut comes through families are not going to go out and blow that money they are going to use that money to provide a better life for their children in this case they are going to put it away for a college fund that is great news for the future of this country that is the way it should be i would like to address another group of people and this is not often discussed in the tax cut plan that is currently on the table out here i talk with a lot of folks where their kids are grown and gone i have a 20yearold an 18yearold the 18yearold heads off to carthage college next year the 20yearold is going to new ulm mn to college i have a 14yearold at home that i am sure will head off to college in three or four years at that point my wife and i become empty nesters an empty nester is a family where the kids have grown and they have left the house and are no longer living there there are a lot of american people out there in their middle forties that are empty nesters they are in this big house that they built to raise their children they do not need that big house anymore the dilemma under the tax code right now is this if they sell their house today and they are 48 years old their kids are gone they decide they want to go into a smaller home lower payments and start saving for their own retirement if that is what they would like to do under todays rules they sell that bigger house and move into a smaller house and the tax burden comes out and grabs lots of money from them under the tax cut package that is here today this is very significant for empty nesters if they wish to downsize their house the government is not going to come and take a portion of the inflated price of their old home their bigger home let me walk through this suppose a family has three kids and they are young kids and when they were 35 years old they bought a house for 35 000 40 000 they kept that home and now they are 48 years old and their kids are all gone and they need a smaller house the home that they bought for 35 000 is now worth 85 000 so there has been a 50 000 inflation in there under the old rules if they sold the house before age 55 they pay taxes on that 50 000 they pay a capital gains tax on it under the new rules if they sell their house even before the age of 55 they do not have to pay the taxes on it so if they want to sell their big house move to a smaller house lower payments and save for themselves for retirement go ahead and do it that is what the new tax rules are saying it is a significant change for a lot of americans that has not really been talked about out here there is another area of tax cuts that i think is very significant lots of people especially my age group 20s 30s on up into the 40s we started saving in a pension plan of some sort for our own retirement many times even outside our employers plan we started some other sort of a savings plan to get ready for our retirement or if it is our place of work and they provide us with a pension plan of some sort in that pension plan they have been buying maybe stocks and bonds or whatever they buy in that pension fund by the time they reach retirement the value of those stocks going to have increased we hope that is why they are buying them so they will increase in value under the old rules when we pull those stocks out of the pension fund we pay a 28 percent tax on them it is called a capital gains tax under the new rules instead of paying 28 percent we will only pay 20 percent that is a very significant reduction that is an 8 percent reduction if we pull money out of our pension funds and let us say we are taking out 1 000 of this profit a month instead of paying 28 percent 280 in taxes out of that thousand dollars we are taking out we are now only going to pay 200 and we get to keep an extra 80 bucks in our own home to spend as we see fit instead of sending it to washington to spend on our behalf another very significant change in the tax code there is lots of good news out there in the tax code a lot of times the american people get bogged down in all the bickering and fighting going on down here in washington but i think it is important as we are listening to that that we remember the huge difference in transition that has taken place from before 1995 to today before 1995 there was no fighting about tax cuts for goodness sakes there was no tax cuts even being discussed the only thing being discussed were which taxes should be increased and how far today yes there are some disagreements over which taxes should be cut and how far but is it not a wonderful situation for the country to be in where we are talking about which taxes to reduce on the american people and how far they should be reduced let us have that debate and the good news is that under the national debt repayment act there is more tax reductions coming for the american people i would encourage every american to get actively involved in this debate if for some reason somebody can find a way that they are not affected by the tax cuts that are currently on the table i think it is important that their representatives know about that so that in the next round of tax cuts as the national debt repayment act is put into place and onethird of the surplus is allocated to additional tax cuts congressional representatives should know exactly what it is that their constituents would like to do with those tax cuts to make sure it affects them too let us make sure everybody in america that is working and paying taxes gets a reduction of some sort because that is what this is all about washington does not need to take as much money from the american people as it is taking i believe very deeply that the american people our families out there our singles out there that the american people can do a much better job of spending their own money than the people out here in washington can so as we go through tax cut round after tax cut round after tax cut round think back to 1993 and just think as we are going through some of these debates what a wonderful thing it is that we are actually having these debates out here in washington as opposed to the alternative which was here in 1993 what i want to do now is just wrap up this discussion i would like to go back to the past the present and the future just quickly through it i will start with the past and again just remind folks exactly how far we have come i always use this chart of the grammrudmanhollings promises because of the past before 1995 a different party in control of the house of representatives the democrats in control of the senate and the presidency what was the world like before 995 before the american people made a change it is not washington that made the change in 1994 the american people decided to make a change before they made that change what was going on and what brought the american people to make that change well in the 1980s they promised under the grammrudmanhollings act to get us to a balanced budget following this blue line for deficits but they did not meet their targets they broke their promises to the american people and it was more than money it was the fact that the people in washington had made promises to the american people when they could not keep their promises they said we know what to do let us make a whole new set of promises and they passed grammrudmanhollings ii and made a whole new set of promises to the american people and again broke those promises to the american people the past folks broken promises pre1995 someone else in control of congress the past these broken promises of a balanced budget the past 1993 which taxes should we raise to get us to a balanced budget and how far should we raise those taxes the gasoline tax social security tax everybodys taxes went up if one owned an automobile they paid more taxes the past broken promises higher taxes the present the american people revolted in 1994 and they put the republicans in control of both the house and the senate to see how different things are those broken promises of the past that is not the group that is here now the american people should evaluate this change they should look out here now and say did the republicans fulfill their commitments or are they like all the rest and broke their promises too well here are the promises the republicans made in 1995 we laid out a plan to balance the federal budget we said in the first year of that plan the deficit could not be more than this red column well it was the blue column we not only hit our target but we were ahead of schedule year 2 we promised not more than the red column blue column is what actually happened year 2 on track ahead of schedule very different we not only hit our targets we were ahead of schedule in the first 2 years we are now in year 3 in year 3 even if we go into a rescission which is what is currently projected this is what was promised back in 1995 and this is where we actually are a very different group of people with very different results how did we make this happen what brought this picture about what brought this picture about is not raising taxes not reaching into the pockets of the american people and giving more money to washington what brought this chart about is curtailing the growth of government spending looking at our government asking ourselves which programs do we not need what can we do to do a better job how can we curtail the growth of government spending government spending is still growing it is still going up by 3 percent a little faster than the rate of inflation but not as fast as it was before and since it is not going up as fast as it was before government spending goes up slower since we are not spending as much money that means the government did not borrow as much out of the private sector when they did not borrow as much our theory was that with more money available in the private sector because the government borrowed less more money would be available in the private sector and interest rates would stay down law of supply and demand with interest rates down people could afford to buy houses and cars which they did and when people bought houses and cars other people had to build them which meant they left the welfare rolls and got a job that is exactly what has led to this picture up here of being not only on track but ahead of schedule so what happened that group that got sent here in 1995 they fulfilled their commitment and curtailed the growth of government spending not draconian cuts spending still went up but at a much slower rate we curtailed the growth of spending to a point where we cannot only balance the budget but also reduce taxes on the people at the same time that is where we are at now today we are actually at a balanced budget in 1998 we will stop spending more money than we have in our checkbook as soon as 1998 and at the same time we are providing tax relief to the american people that is what has happened and that is a very different picture than 1993 the past the present the future the future of this party the future of this great nation much more important than the party itself the future of our country needs to recognize that even after we get to a balanced budget we still have a huge debt hanging over our heads five trillion dollars we need to live up to and accept the responsibilities of our generation a generation who has spent this money our generation has overdrawn its checkbook each year since 1969 the future folks we must do what is right for the future of this country and live up to our moral and ethical responsibilities to do something about the 5 3 trillion debt we do not want to pass that on to our children i think it is totally inappropriate for our generation to look the other way and pass that debt on to our children our job is to do something about it and that is the national debt repayment act we introduced it today in congress the national debt repayment act goes like this it says after we reach a balanced budget that is the same number of dollars coming in as what the government is writing out checks for after our budget is in balance we cap the growth of spending at a rate 1 percent lower than the rate of revenue growth if revenues go up faster than spending that creates a very small surplus to begin with the surplus grows each year onethird of that surplus goes to providing additional tax cuts to working families twothirds to repay the federal debt the future the future is paying off the entire federal debt under this plan by the year 2026 giving our nation to our children debtfree and of course as we are paying off the debt we restore the social security trust fund the future the future is the national debt repayment act providing additional tax cuts to working families a secure future and debtfree nation for our children and restore the social security trust fund so our seniors once again are secure in this great nation that we live in that is a very different vision than the past that we have had here this is such good news for america it is such good news it should be put out on every station to let all the people know just how changed this place is the past broken promises higher taxes the present third year of a 7year plan to balance the budget on track and ahead of schedule very changed place curtailing the growth of government spending to the point where we can both balance the budget and at the same time reduce taxes on our families out there and after all that is what this is all about the futurq the future is about our children and future generations of americans the future the national debt repayment act where we repay the entire federal debt by the year 2026 and give this nation to our children debtfree the national debt repayment act where we are paying off the debt and restoring the social security trust fund the national debt repayment act where we allow additional tax cuts for working families additional tax cuts for working families a restored social security trust fund for our seniors and a debtfree nation for our children that is a vision for the future of this great nation that we live in that is what i sincerely hope happens out of what has started here today as we have introduced the national debt repayment act and that is my vision for the future of america"], [1.7177888366859406e-05, 1.7177888366859406e-05, 0, "for the purpose of debate only i yield the customary 30 minutes to my very good friend the gentleman from dayton oh pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume during consideration of this resolution all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only"], [1.8353497580392286e-05, 1.8353497580392286e-05, 0, "i rise today to bring back information that i heard all over my district this weekend we had a chance to travel and see my son who is a junior in college i got a chance to talk to some of his friends at college as well as some of their parents i thought i would come back today and relay some of the information regarding the tax cuts becausethey still seem to be generally misunderstood out there they affect so many people in so many good ways that this is good news that just plain needs to go out to the american people i would like to start today by going through the tax cuts reminding all of my colleagues out there what is all in the bill as it relates to these tax cuts and remember this is legislation that has actually passed congress this is now the law the law has changed dramatically in terms of how much taxes are owed by families out there by senior citizens out there the tax laws have changed and they have changed dramatically i thought i would start today by revamping what is in the change in the tax code before i go into the specifics of this i think it is important to also note that we are about to balance the budget for the first time since 1969 for all the folks out there saying how can you both cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time let me explain very simply that by curtailing the growth of washington spending that is washington spending grows less that leaves more money available and it is simply being returned to the american people so we are both balancing the budget and lowering taxes at the same time let me go into some of the things that i found that my families out in the first district of wisconsin were talking about and found very useful for their information let me start with the simplest one that is the most straightforward each family with children next year 17 or younger gets a 400 tax credit for each child if we start there with the simplest one what this really means is that in january of next year a family with children should go into their place of employment they should lower the amount of tax dollars that are sent to washington dc by 33 per month per child this is literally a change of where the money that our workers are earning where that money is going to in the past that 33 came out here to washington now it should go into your takehome pay but you have to go in and adjust the w4 form in order to increase your takehome pay and decrease the amount of money that is coming out here to washington the 33 per month per child is very simply 400 the tax credit per child divided by the 12 months in the year starting with january of next year a family with children should increase their takehome pay by 33 per month for each one of their children so if you are a family of five like ours you have three kids 17 and younger for example you should increase your takehome pay by roughly 100 per month starting next january that affects approximately 550 000 wisconsin families alone but it does not end there families saving up to send their children to college there is a new education savings account and it works like this a family with children can put 500 per year into a savings account that will then accumulate interest tax free until the children are ready to go to college called the education savings account i found that a lot of the grandparents were talking about this because a lot of times a birthday will come or christmas and they will not quite know what to get the grandchildren for a gift this makes a wonderful gift the grandparents can literally put this money into the education savings account and it works like an ira for the kids when the kids get to college education age they simply take the money out and use it to go to college another one for families with kids already in college if you have a freshman or a sophomore in college virtually all freshmen and sophomores in college paying 2 000 a year or more for room board and tuition will get a 1 500 credit next year on their taxes if you have a freshman or a sophomore in college it is a 1 500 tax credit next year it works like this it is 100 percent of the first 1 000 of cost and 50 percent of the next 1 000 or 1 500 total out of a total cost of 2 000 so for most of the families and most of the college students i was talking to over in new ulm mn most of those families will get a 1 500 credit next year for the freshman and sophomore if you are beyond the sophomore year it is 20 percent of the first 5 000 or in most cases it is 1 000 so for freshmen and sophomores the tax credit is 1 500 for juniors seniors and beyond that the tax credit is 1 000 and again if you are not paying that much overall for your room board and tuition and total cost of going to college it is prorated backwards freshmen and sophomores virtually all of them that we talked to would be eligible for the 1 500 per year credit junior seniors and beyond many of them are going to be eligible for the full 1 000 and some of them prorated amounts these are major changes in tax code policy that are going to allow our families with children and with college age children to keep more of their own money let me give you an example what we found friends of ours from church they have got one off in college just started this year is going to the same school as my daughter carthage college in kenosha wi they have got two kids still at home that family is eligible for 1 500 for the student enrolled at carthage and 400 for each one of the two kids at home for a total of 2 300 let me translate that again in january of next year this family should literally start taking home roughly 200 a month more of their own money instead of sending it to washington again this is a family with a freshman who got 1 500 for the freshman college credit 400 for each of the other two children still at home for a total of 2 300 that they keep in their house instead of sending it to washington it was really interesting because when i talked to some of the folks out there they said i do not have kids and therefore i am not eligible for any of this a lot of those families found that they had stock that had appreciated in value they were going to sell that stock of course the capital gains rate has been reduced from 28 to 20 percent again i pause in between this is not washington jargon this is the law this has been passed it has been changed the benefit is there it is on the books the capital gains tax rate has been reduced from 28 percent to 20 percent if you sell stocks or bonds or whatever else it is you might have in that portfolio i caution folks take a good look at this because there are time limits on how long you have to have held the investment let me go to another one that a lot of folks did not realize this affected one family we saw some friends of ours that had moved from wisconsin to minnesota in fact they had sold their home in wisconsin as most people do that have been in their home for a period of time they made a profit selling the home that is the way it works the change in the tax law now says that if you sell your home after you have lived in it for 2 or more years there are no federal taxes due i started explaining this to one family in green bay wi the caller on this radio show asked me three times if i was sure i had this right if you have lived in your home for 2 years or more principal residence for 2 years or more and you sell the home and make a profit there are no federal taxes due the old age 55 where folks in their early 50s wanted to sell but waited for the 55 exclusion the exclusion is gone it is at any time during your life if it is your principal residence for 2 years or more there are no federal taxes due on the sale of your home a person in a situation of a job transfer like our friends we saw in minnesota this weekend where they sold a home in wisconsin and moved to minnesota they are no longer forced to purchase a home of equal or greater value to put off paying taxes that is the way it used to be it is not true anymore if you sell your home there are no federal taxes due if it has been your principal residence for 2 years or more in virtually all cases i have not talked too much about the farmers ninety percent of all farms can now be passed on to the next generation because of this new tax change without paying federal taxes on it as it is passed from one generation to another same thing on closely held family businesses then i saw some union workers some of the union workers said but my kids are all grown and gone and they are out of college i do not qualify for any of those things you just described in fact i am in a pension plan where i work and therefore none of that stuff is applicable to me i said did you think about the roth ira people in their early 50s kids grown and gone they are out of college they are no longer around and not eligible for any of these other tax cuts they said well we are not thinking of selling our house i said to them why do you not think about the roth ira the roth ira is a brand new account that is going to help allow millions of americans prepare to take care of themselves in retirement the roth ira works like this you can put up to 2 000 per year into the roth ira the interest that accumulates or stock appreciation or whatever you put this roth ira into as it appreciates in value you reach retirement age you take the money out you do not pay taxes on it the roth ira is sort of like the ira of old only backward and open to a lot more people it used to be in the old iras this is still available for those people that were eligible before but in the old ira you put 2 000 in you wrote it off on your taxes this year under the roth ira you do not get the tax deduction this year but when you take the money out in the future the appreciated money you do not pay taxes on it in retirement it is a great way to save for retirement for millions and millions of americans that virtually takes into account any of the other folks that were not covered or benefited by one of the other tax cuts that i spoke of earlier i talked to some young couples who were thinking of a first home or saving up for a future college education maybe had a bachelors degree and looking to go back to school complete a masters or a doctorate under the new iras they can also save up for their first home or for future education costs under the roth ira so the good news is these tax cuts when we were all over and done discussing them we found that virtually every american benefits in some way shape or form from the tax cuts from families with 400 per child to the 1 500 for college credit to the 1 000 for those that are further on in college to those that are saving for their own retirement to those who are already in retirement and sold their home virtually everybody across the board benefited from the tax cut package it is just time that america understands what is in it my fear is this my fear is that january is going to get here and those 550 000 families in wisconsin that are eligible to keep 33 per month per child more of their own money in their own home they are not going to do it they are going to let that money keep flowing out here to washington wlen washington sees the money as hard as members like myself are going to fight to stop them from spending it it is going to be more difficult with the money out here in washington than if the folks keep the money in their home themselves that money belongs to our families in wisconsin and other families across america those families ought to keep their own money do not send it out here to washington and hope you will get it back a year later keep it in your own home you earned it it is not a gift from washington keep your own money and make the changes as soon as you can you are eligible in january of next year and those changes should be put into effect immediately if you have got a freshman in college 125 bucks a month you ought to be keeping of your own money if you have a child under the age of 17 17 and under 33 a month make the changes in your withholding immediately so that money does not get out here to washington first good news for america i conclude this portion of what i have to say here today on the tax cuts in a very upbeat mode because we have not only lowered taxes we did not do it at the expense of future generations of americans we have lowered taxes at the same time we balanced the budget and we did it by controlling washington spending and i think that is what the change in 1994 was all about with that having been said i think we should talk about what has happened in the past out here in washington because it is pretty significant there is a lot of people very concerned about it myself included it is really the primary reason i left the private sector what i have in this chart is the growing debt facing the united states of america we can see that from 1960 to 1980 this debt grew in a very small amount but from 1980 forward this debt has grown right off the chart alot of people look at 1980 and they say that is when ronald reagan was elected that is the democrats they blame the republicans and republicans go that is that democrat congress they spent out of control and the republicans all blame the democrats the bottom line is that as americans we need to understand what we are about here on this chart if we keep fighting republicans and democrats the problem is not going to get resolved this is an american problem we need to look at this picture and understand the problem is real and start addressing the problem if you have not seen how much debt we are in as a nation it is almost scary to talk about it the number is 5 3 trillion and the number looks like this the people that were here in washington before 1995 saw fit to spend 5 3 trillion more than they collected in taxes basically in the last 15 years let me translate that into english i used to teach math we used to divide the total debt by the number of people in the country every man woman and child in america today is responsible for 20 000 of debt if we divided debt up amongst all the people in the country 20 000 for every man woman and child in america and for a family of five like mine it is 100 000 here is the kicker on the debt that is real debt and like all debt you pay interest on it a family of five today in america is literally paying 580 a month every month to do nothing but pay interest on the federal debt let me put this another way the federal government is collecting taxes out of the payohecks of workers all across america for a family of five in the amount of 580 a month to do nothing but pay interest on the federal debt a lot of folks are going i do not have to worry i do not pay that much in taxes the reality is every time you walk in the store and you do something as simple as buy a loaf of bread the store owner makes a small profit on that loaf of bread and part of that profit gets sent out here to washington dc you guessed it it goes to pay interest on the federal debt as a matter of fact 1 out of every 6 that the federal government spends remember when they spend money they are collecting it out of your paychecks first 1 out of every 6 that they collect out of your paychecks goes to do nothing but pay interest on the federal debt i think it is reasonable to ask how it is that we got to this situation i think to answer that question we ought to look back at what was going on out here before 1995 so we can see the difference in 1994 the american people said we are not going to put up with this anymore and they elected a new congress and i think it is important to look at the difference between the past and what is happening now and understand that there has in fact been a very significant change this is the grammrudmanhollings bill of 1985 and the blue line shows how they were going to decrease the deficits and get a balanced budget in 1991 the red line shows what they actually did back then they did not meet those targets they left the blue line literally after 1 year and they never came close to hitting the targets again well they did what washington does pretty well when they saw they could not make the first projections they gave some new promises out of this city and the new promises went like this well we will balance the budget by 1993 we see we cannot keep the old promises so we will make some new ones but what happened is after a year and a half they quit honoring their promises again and in 1993 the year they were supposed to have the budget balanced based on all those promises again instead of balancing the budget they raised taxes the thinking went like this well we understand we cannot control washington spending so what we will do instead is we will simply reach into the paychecks of american workers and take more money out here to washington because if we get more money out of their paychecks we can maintain our washington programs keep spending money out in this city and eventually we will get to a balanced budget because we will keep taking more and more money out of their paychecks that was 1993 the biggest tax increase in american history was passed in that year that has led to the problems of today raising taxes did not and does not work to balance the federal budget that is not how to go about balancing the federal budget well in 1994 the american people looked at this situationand said broken promises higher taxes that is not what we want going on in washington dc we want a group of people out there who will promise us a balanced budget keep their promises and at the same time lower our taxes that was 3 years ago and i think it is reasonable that the american people start asking what has happened since 1995 when we put the republicans in control of the house of representatives and we put the republicans in control of the senate has it been different let us be fair about this they left a democrat president in control out here so the american people have a right to ask with republicans in control of the house and republicans in control of the senate and in all fairness a democrat president what is going on well in 1995 we laid a plan into place to balance the federal budget too we inherited this if we had done nothing when we came here if we had done absolutely nothing when we got to washington this was where the deficit was going to as a matter of fact it would have grown to 350 billion when we got here in 1995 if nothing would have changed we would have played golf we would have played basketball and not done our job the deficit was growing and it was going to keep right on growing after 12 months and many people remember the hassles of the first 12 months of 1995 in those 12 months we went through battle after battle after battle to change what was going on in washington dc by the end of december if we had quit at that point the yellow line shows where the deficit would have gone but we had this plan in place and the plan was the green line this green line is much like what we saw in the grammnrudmanhollings promise of the past chart the only difference is instead of missing our targets we are not only on track but ahead of schedule remember this is the promise much like the promises made under grammrudmanhollings but instead of being above that target we are below the target we are not only on track to a balanced budget but we are significantly ahead of schedule is there anything different from pre1995 to post1995 you bet your bottom dollar there is a lot of difference out here instead of missing our targets we are on track and ahead of schedule and we will deliver to the american people a balanced budget literally by the year 1999 at the latest maybe even 1998 3 years ahead of schedule no more broken promises we are not doing it with higher taxes but by controlling the growth of washington spending when i am home in my district and i am telling this a lot of people say yes but the economy is strong it is all the economy that is doing it and in all fairness the economy is strong but we have had strong economies in the past and when we have had strong ecomomies in the past and washington slides to revenue washington simply increases their spending to match that increase in revenue and the deficits kept going up washington is different since 1995 and i think the people have a right to know before 1995 when we got here this red column shows how fast spending was going up it was going up 5 2 percent annually when we got here in 1995 we slowed the growth of washington spending instead of going up at 5 2 percent it is now going up at 3 2 percent frankly faster than some of us would still like to see it we would like to see this even smaller yet but let us be real about this we had a 40percent drop in the growth of washington spending in a 2year period of time we have a strong economy extra revenues coming in and at the same time we have slowed the growth of washington spending the result the result is we can both balance the budget and reduce taxes at the same time that is great news for the future of this country i brought a chart to help explain this a little better because it gets reasonably simple to understand how that changes the impact of what is going on out here and why we are actually at a balanced budget sooner rather than later and why we can both reduce taxes and balance the budget at the same time this red line shows spending growing at 5 2 percent just like the last chart i had up here and we will notice when we get to 1995 the red line starts going up at a slower rate well since the red line is going up at a slower rate and the blue line shows revenues and the blue line keeps going up at a very strong rate well if the red line goes up slower and the blue line goes up faster we reach a balanced budget ahead of schedule that is in effect what has happened we can see from this picture that as the revenues grow at a faster rate and spending instead of growing at a faster rate to keep up with that grows at a slower rate we get to the point where the two lines cross each other and in fact we have a balanced budget not only in the year 2002 as promised but significantly ahead of schedule perhaps 1998 or 1999 it is also interesting to note what happens next with the revenues continuing to grow and the spending growth slow we actually create a surplus out here where we can look at having more federal dollars coming in than what we are spending now i do not think we should negate our obligation and responsibility here with more federal dollars coming in than what we are spending we certainly have a responsibility to return some of those dollars to the american people but we also still have that 5 4 trillion debt staring us in the face and that has to be paid down but the point here is that as revenues keep going up and spending growth is slowed we get to a balanced budget not only on track but ahead of schedule and we actually start developing surpluses as early as the year 1999 this is phenomenal news for the united states of america and it is a phenomenal change from where we were before 1995 the credit for all of this the credit should go to the american people because after all it is the american people that saw fit to change who was in control of washington who saw fit to send a group out here that would in fact control the growth of washington spending as opposed to spending more in the face of a strong economy i have one other chart up here that just helps us also to see just exactly what is going on and how much we are keeping our commitment to the american people the red columns here show the promises made by the new congress in 1995 when we got here and these are easy to check these are actually down in law this is the deficit projection that we said in order to reach a balanced budget we had to achieve well in 1996 we said the deficit had to be 154 billion as we laid out our path to a balanced budget it came in actually not only on target but ahead of schedule at 1oy7 billion the second year 1997 we had projected it had to stay at least at 174 billion in order to keep us on track actually it is coming in the chart shows 67 it is actually coming in at 34 billion i want to talk a bit about how this helps the economy and why we are seeing such a boom even though we are at the end of what might be considered a normal business cycle this means the government spent 100 billion less than everyone expected them to spend when the government spends 100 billion less and that means they borrow less out of the private sector that means there is 100 billion more money available in the private sector this is kind of the law of supply and demand if there is more money available in the private sector needless to say the interest rates will stay down with the interest rates down of course the natural things happen people buy more houses they buy more cars they buy more things and when people buy more houses and cars because the interest rates are down that of course means there are job opportunities because people have to build those houses and build those cars and build those washers and dryers and all the other things they are buying to go into those homes so it works pretty much like this the government not only hit their target but they are way ahead of schedule 100 billion since they borrowed 100 billion less out of the private sector that left 100 billion more available in the private sector well banks had to lend that money out so they kept the interest rates down so people would buy more houses and cars people bought more houses and cars and when they did that of course other people went to work and started paying taxes instead of drawing off the welfare roll that was our theory back in 1995 this picture shows how well that theory works it is kind of a selffulfulling prophecy as the government borrows less there is more money available the interest rates stay down and when the interest rates are low and capital is available that means people buy houses and cars when they buy houses and cars we expect the unemployment rate to stay low and that is actually happening all around us right now so i contend the picture we are looking at is not really not to be expected it should be expected because the theory is now a reality it is not a theory any longer it is now a working model and in fact we see in this picture our working model is very effective and works pretty well now having said all that i go back to the first chart we had up here it is the chart that shows the growing debt because as positive and optimistic and upbeat as all this is we have talked about the fact that it has changed since before 1995 in the past we had the broken promises of grammrudmanhollings in the past we had the tax increases of 1993 and in 1994 the american people changed that they put the republicans in control of the house and the republicans in control of the senate and in all fairness they have left a democrat president in charge so let us keep it as bipartisan as we can but the reality is it changed dramatically in 1994 so with this change we have reached a balanced budget for the first time in a generation and lowered taxes for the first time in 16 years but we have still got this problem that we are right here on this debt chart so i think the remaining question that has to be asked is if this group that is now in charge out here is actually going to solve the problems facing this nation balancing the budget for the first time since 1969 lowering taxes for the first time in 16 years restoring medicare what about that debt that is still out there facing the american people are we really willing to leave that as the legacy that we pass on to our children if nothing is done about it we keep the budget balanced so we do not borrow more money we will still pass that 5 3 trillion debt on to our children that is the remaining question that needs to be answered i am happy to say that we have developed a plan that specifically addresses that question it is called the national debt repayment act now under the national debt repayment act of course our ultimate goal is to pay off the federal debt to pass this nation on to our children debt free when we think of the benefits of passing this nation on to our children debt free it would be nice if a generation from now a family of five did not have to send 580 to washington to pay nothing but interest on the federal debt here is how the plan works after we reach a balanced budget and again it has to do with the revenue line climbing faster than the spending line after we reach a balanced budget we cap the growth of washington spending at a rate 1 percent lower than the rate of revenue growth now a lot of folks will look at this red line which is the spending growth and say wait a minute i have been hearing about these draconian cuts that are being made in washington but how come that spending line is still going up there well it is time the american people get to know the truth even when washington slows the growth of washington spending the spending line is still going up they are still spending more money each and every year many of us would like to see this red line much flatter than what it is i have made a reasonable projection here as to what can be accomplished in this community even with all the pressures to do all the different things being leveled on the many people out here in washington so what our bill does is it says we will let spending go up but at a slower rate than the rate of revenue growth if revenues go up faster than the rate of spending growth that creates a surplus that surplus is used to two ways first we use onethird of it to further reduce the taxes on the american people and let me address further reducing the taxes on theamerican people our tax code is so complicated that virtually no one out there can understand it our tax code is so complicated and i was so frustrated this morning i about threw one of our staff members out the window and i owe him an apology because i was so upset because as we started going through the tax rules they are so complicated it seemed like nobody was willing to write down what the actual answer to our question was because nobody was 100 percent sure because the rules are so complicated so as we look at this picture and realize that we can in fact create these surpluses by controlling the growth of washington spending onethird of those surpluses dedicated to additional tax cuts let us start by looking at opportunities to reform the tax code in its entirety maybe throw out the irs as we know this complicated monster to be today and start with something newer and simpler that people can in fact understand so i would suggest we use the additional tax cuts for acrosstheboard tax cuts and the other thing i think needs to be eliminated is the marriage tax penalty and it is important to get to that in a hurry in america today if four people all work at the same job and all earn exactly the same income but two of those people are married to each other and two of those people are living together forget the social evaluations on what you think of that the facts are that two people that are married to each other pay more taxes than the two people that are living with each other and that is not right in this nation that is promoting exactly the opposite of what many of us would think we should be promoting in this country r would say we need to eliminate the marriage tax penalty and look for acrosstheboard tax cuts and with that onethird let us look to revamp the tax system in its entirety and get to something that we can understand i have another example of how frustrating it is my 14yearold son who mowed lawns and made 900 mowing those lawns owed 128 into the social security system but because he was selfemployed filling out the forms is complicated enough that you need an accountant to do it that is how ridiculous our tax system is today as we look at this picture and we realize that simply slowing the growth of washington spending will allow us to develop this surplus and onethird of the surplus goes to additional tax cuts hopefully revamping the tax system the other twothirds goes to paying down debt let us make this very very clear if this program is put into place in 2026 the entire debt all of it would be repaid that is to say we could pass this nation on to our children debtfree think about the difference and the contrast in these legacies as we look before 1995 we were looking at passing on a legacy of trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars of debt to our children we can now look forward to a bright future in america where instead of passing on a 5plus trillion debt we could literally be on track to pay the federal debt off in its entirety and instead leave our children a legacy of a debtfree nation what a wonderful opportunity we have staring us in the face in understanding that if we simply control the growth of washington spending we can literally repay the federal debt twothirds of that surplus then is allocated toward repaying the debt i would like to go into one other thing as we are paying down the debt that is very important the social security trust fund plays into this picture very prominently in social security today we collect more tax dollars than what we are paying back out to our senior citizens in benefits as a matter of fact this year alone the federal government will take out of paychecks taxes that equal 70 billion more than what is paid back out to senior citizens in benefits if you collect more money than you are paying out to seniors in benefits the question is what happens to that 70 billion it is supposed to be sitting out here in washington in a savings account on reserve so that when the baby boomer generation hits retirement and starts drawing social security the savings account is there you get the money out of the savings account and make good on the social security checks i suspect this will come as no great surprise to anyone when we acknowledge the fact that there is no savings account all of that money that has been collected that was supposed to be put on reserve for social security has been spent on other washington programs it is all part of the 5 4 trillion debt again i say 5 3 trillion and 5 4 trillion sometimes the debt is rapidly growing almost as we are on this floor speaking the debt is growing at roughly 10 000 a second even as i speak here today and even as it has been slowed that is why it is so important we keep this on track the social security trust fund is collecting more dollars than it is paying back out to seniors in benefits it is supposed to be sitting in the savings account it is not it has been spent on other government programs all part of the 5 4 trillion debt that brings us back to this picture as we develop these surpluses by controlling the growth of spending as we drop those surpluses and we start paying off the federal debt one thing we are doing is putting the money back into the social security trust fund again let me make this clear the money that is being collected today for social security over and above what is being paid back out to our senior citizens inbenefits it is currently being spent on other washington programs that is wrong that needs to be stopped under the national debt repayment act all of that money that has been taken out of the social security trust fund would be returned to the social security trust fund and social security would once again be solvent for our senior citizens where are we going with the national debt repayment act under the national debt repayment act for seniors the social security trust fund would be restored all of the money that has been taken out of social security would be put back into the social security trust fund for people in the workforce today and for anyone who has ever been frustrated filling out their tax forms under our national debt repayment act onethird of the surplus is going to additional tax cuts each year which could then be used to revamp the irs and make a simpler system overall most important for our children most important of all for the children of this nation we can give them a legacy of a debtfree country instead of passing on a 5 3 trillion debt from our generation to theirs once again the next generation in america can look forward to a stronger and a better america like we could when our parents passed this nation on to us that is what this is all about and that is what it should be all about i would like to kind of summarize today by going back through the tax cuts just briefly and then summarizing the past and the present to wrap up my hour on the floor today tax cuts i found to be the most nonunderstood package out there in america today i am going to run through them quickly if you have got children 17 and under most folks are going to get a 400 credit or 33 a month starting in january next year workers should start keeping 33 more a month in their paychecks you do that by adjusting your w4 forms if you have got a college student who is a freshman or sophomore you get 1 500 starting january of next year again adjust your paychecks so you keep 125 a month of your own money instead of sending it here to washington after all you earned it it is not a gift from washipgton you earned it please keep it starting in january of next year if you have got children noncollege age 17 and under it is 400 400 divided by 12 is 33 a month start keeping it in january of next year if you have a freshman or sophomore in college it is 1 500 a year 125 a month keep it in your paycheck do not sent it out here for juniors and seniors in most cases it will be 1 000 a year again it is based on 20 percent of the first 5 000 of cost young couples if you want to save up to buy your first home you can do that in the taxfree savings account called the roth ira farm owners if you want to pass your farm on to the next generation in 90 percent of the cases you will be able to do it without paying taxes same thing for all businesses for the small business owner and i did not mention this before the deductibility of health insurance is going up to 100 percent over the next 10year period of time homeowners perhaps the most significant change in the tax code if you own your home and it was your principal residence for 2 years or more and you sell that home there is no federal taxes due on this to the young lady in green bay wi who called me three times to make sure i had that right yes i have that right if you sell your home and you are in your principal residence for two years or more you do not owe the federal government taxes on the sale of that home for many of the senior citizens who bought at 22 000 and are selling their home for 70 000 this is a huge change for many people in america who have had a job transfer and in the past gone into the new city and felt obligated to buy a house as ex~iensive or more expensive than the one they sold from now on that is your choice there are no federal taxes due on the sale of your home if it has been your principal residence for 2 years again to the young woman in green bay who called and asked three times we do have it right there are no taxes due on the sale of your home the capital gains tax reduction is from 28 percent down to 20 it goes to 18 even later on in the tax bill capital gains depending on your income level if you are earning 41 000 a year or more your capital gains tax rate will go to 20 percent it used to be 28 percent that is 8 for every 100 you make on the sale of a stock bonds or that sort of entity if you are in a lower income bracket it goes to 10 percent capital gains is another reduction how is all of this possible this is all possible because the people that you all the american people sent to washington the people that you sent to washington have restrained the growth of washington spending instead of washington spending more money we are able now to let you keep more of the money you earn in your own home instead of starting new washington spending programs out here and the programs are not working spending was going up by 5 2 percent before we got here we have slowed the growth by 40 percent it is now going up by 3 2 it is still going up too fast for many of us i have talked to a lot of my constituents out there who are very concerned about the fact that washington spending is still going up too fast and i have to tell all of those folks i agree with them it is still going up too fast but it is going up at a much slower rate than it was before because we have a strong economy coupled with a slower growth of federal spending we are now able to balance the budget for the first time since 1969 lower taxes for the first time in 16 years and restore medicare all at the same time this is good news for america this is what we got sent here to do in 1995 and i am happy to report back to the american people that with the republicancontrolled house and republicancontrolled senate and in all fairness with a democrat president we have gotten to the point where we have literally balanced the budget for the first time since 1969 when i was a sophomore in high school lowered taxes and restored medicare the future even after the budget is balanced we have still got that 5 3 trillion debt staring us in the face the social security money is part of that 5 3 trillion debt i am happy to report that we have a bill on the table today that will in fact pay off the entire federal debt by 2023 restore the social security trust fund for our senior citizens and lower taxes each and every year as far as the eye can see giving us the opportunity to dump the irs as we know it today and get in a system that is easier simpler and fairer to the american people that is a complete picture of an entirely changed government in washington dc the pat of broken promises and higher taxes changed in 1995 to a government that is goingto do the right thing balance the budget lower taxes restore medicare and a group of people that are actually looking forward to the future and acknowledging that we still have these problems that must be addressed we are going to pay off the federal debt restore the social security trust fund and lower taxes even further and reform the irs that is what the future holds and for a change we should be looking brightly to the future and to bright wonderful opportunities of growth and hope and prosperity for our children for the next generation that is what this is all about and that is what the american people as well as my colleagues here in washington need to know has changed out here it is a phenomenal change more important than any of the people here in this city is what it means to the future of this great nation we live in once again our generation has a chance to look forward to the next generation and say in fact that we are able to pass america on to the next generation in better shape than we received it in"], [2.4140979803632945e-05, 2.4140979803632945e-05, 0, "i rise tonight to talk about good news for america i just had a wonderful opportunity during the past month to see lots of folks all across wisconsin and it was very educational for me and i hope for some of the folks we saw that they picked up on some of the good things that have happened here in the last month or thereabouts out here in washington the one thing that struck me though as i talked to more and more of our families across wisconsin and our senior citizens across wisconsin and some of our young people college age students across wisconsin they did not really realize that the tax cut bill has been signed into law so i would like to begin this evening by pointing out that the tax cut bill along with the first balanced budget since 1969 and restoring medicare has all been signed it is done the ink is dry the president signed it it has passed the house it has passed the senate first balanced budget since 1969 taxes coming down for the first time in 16 years and medicare restored for at least a decade that is what was accomplished before we left for recess in august the other thing i learned is that not very many people really understood what was in the tax cut bill and i would start talking to people and i would say well the budget is balanced thats the most important thing we could do and that was our responsibility and thats done and at the same time weve reduced your taxes and they go yeah sure but that affects somebody else and then we would start through it and the first question would be do you have children and this is so important if you have children age 17 or younger for virtually all families out there 550 000 wisconsin families alone you are eligible to keep 400 more for each one of your children in your own home next year instead of sending it to washington we should make this very clear this is not somehow a gift from washington to the people this is money that the people get up in the morning they go to their jobs they work hard and they earn the money but instead of sending it to washington they keep it in their own homes to spend on their own families and the way they see fit that is the first part of the tax code and i am going to put this a little different so folks have a handle on how important and significant this is in january of next year a family with a child with one child should go into their place of employment they should talk to the person that handles the w4 forms they should increase their exemptions so as to increase their takehome pay by 33 per month it is 33 per month in increased takehome pay for each one of the children in the house and my fear is people are not going to do this my fear is what is going to happen is they are just going to go through the year and washington is going to see all this extra money coming out here that those families should be keeping in their own home and of course when washington sees money sometimes they spend it out here and i will admit as hard as we try to stop that and as hard as i personally worked to stop them from spending on new programs it would be much much better if our families out there did the right thing and again let me make this very clear starting in january of next year a family with children should go into their place of employment they should talk to the personnel director whoever it is that handles the w4 forms they should change the number of exemptions so as to allow their takehome pay to increase for 33 per month per child let me put this another way if you have three children in your family for most families you should start taking home 100 a month more in your takehome paycheck than what you were in december so the difference between your takehome pay in december and january should be 100 a month for a family with three children that is significant it is real the bill is signed you should do it in january of next year increase your takehome pay keep the money in your own home do not send it out here to washington but that is not all in the tax cut bill the other thing that people seemed when i talked with them out in wisconsin to be generally familiar with was the capital gains reduction the capital gains tax in the past was 28 percent and that has been reduced to 20 percent so the good news is that capital gains the amount of money that you send to washington is lower when you sell a stock or a bond or whatever it is that you might have held and made a profit on good news is that drops even further in the year 2000 to 18 percent and it depends on your income bracket there if you are in a 41 000ayear or higher income bracket the capital gains are 20 percent and if you are lower than that they dropped all the way down to 10 percent those two people seem to be vaguely familiar with at least out there but there is a whole bunch of others that they were not familiar with at all let me start with the first one if people own a home homeowners for the most part when they sell their home will no longer owe any federal taxes in the vast majority of the cases very few exceptions and only on the very higherpriced homes will people owe any money in federal taxes if you have lived in your residence it is your personal residence you have lived there for 2 years or more you will not owe any federal taxes when you go to sell your home this affects a whole bunch of people there were a lot of folks out there empty nesters people whose children are grown and gone who are waiting for that onetime exclusion at age 55 to sell their home and downsize that is no longer necessary the age 55 onetime exclusion is gone it is no longer there if you lived in your home for 2 years you sell the home you make a profit there is no tax on it it was interesting i was in green bay wi i was doing a radio talk show about the tax cuts and i had a young lady call in and she said well i bought my home for 22 000 and im now about to sell it for 60 000 so a period of years have gone by and she said how much taxes am i going to owe and i said well youre not going to owe any federal taxes on the sale of your home so she said does that mean i owe income taxes and i said no no you do not owe any federal taxes when you go to sell that house and she said even though it went from 22 000 im going to get 60 000 back how much taxes do i owe she asked me three times the same question because folks are having a hard time believing that washington actually did something right they actually lowered taxes instead of raising them like they were doing previously so the third part here that i would like to talk about then in the tax cut if you owned your home you have lived there for 2 years or more and you sell your home in the vasz majority of the cases the only exceptions are the very high priced homes you will not owe any federal taxes on the sale of that home this affects a lot of senior citizens also in wisconsin 74 percent of our senior citizens still own their home and it may be people that took the onetime 55 exclusion that had bought a different home at age 56 maybe a smaller home or whatever but if they have lived in the house for 2 years and they are now 60 let us say for example they can now sell that home move to a different home if they like own it for 2 years sell it again so there is no onetime exclusion you can do this as many times as you want as long as you live in the home for at least 2 years so this part was very unfamiliar with most of the people out there then i went on to the part and i started talking about saving up for their childrens education because we had a lot of families that we were talking with and we started talking about the fact that it is now possible to put 500 per year per child into what is called an education savings account the money then accumulates tax free and the student can then take it out when they reach age 18 and are ready to go off to college i talked to a lot of grandparents about this account because it seems that there are a lot of grandparents that are interested in giving their grandchildren some sort of a gift whether it be a christmas or their birthday or whatever and it makes an ideal gift from a grandparent to a grandchild and i know everybody cannot afford it but there are some grandparents out there who would like to give this sort of a gift to their grandchildren and it is certainly an ideal way to provide their grandchildren with a college education again the education savings account you can put 500 a year into this savings account the money accumulates tax free and when the kids take it out at age 18 they pay on the lower tax rate that they would be at so it is money for them for college speaking of college very very important i took my daughter to her first year of college my son had left forhe is a junior in college and of course we talked to a lot of college students and the parents of a lot of college students and there is a general lack of understanding of how this college tuition credit is going to work well it works like this if you have got a freshman or a sophomore in college and the cost of their college education is 2 000 a year or more and in wisconsin at least that is the vast majority of the cases if it is 2 000 a year or more in costs the parents get to keep 1 500 more of their own hardearned money in their own home rather than sending it out here to washington and again i would point out this is not a gift from washington this is money that the people have gotten up in the morning gone to work and earned the only thing is instead of being taxed on it instead of that tax coming out here to washington and washington spending it you keep that money in your own home so if you have a freshman in college and the costs of their college tuition is 2 000 room board and tuition is 2 000 or more you should start keeping 125 a month more in your takehome pay starting in january of next year and again that is simply 1 500 divided by 12 is 125 a month more for juniors and seniors if the cost is over 5 000 which in many cases it is for room board and tuition you should stait keeping a thousand dollars more of your own money in your own paycheck and again that should start in january this is very very straightforward and if the people do not start keeping their own money if they send it out here to washington we are not sure washington is not going to spend the money we here in washington many of us want the people to start keeping their own money next january why should you send it out here to washington when it is your money college tuition then freshman and sophomores in most cases are going to get a 1 500 credit juniors and seniors in most cases in many many cases are going to get a 1 000 credit i said are you interested in saving more money for retirement he said yes but i am in a pension funds already so none of those iras affect me i said well no that is not entirely true in fact this new ira called the roth ira you can put 2 000 per year into the roth ira per person so in this case a husband and wife could put 4 000 away for their retirement you put after tax dollars into the roth ira but when you take the tax dollars out at retirement it is tax free this might be one of the best provisions for middle age people in the entire country this might be one of the best savings accounts in terms of taking care of yourself in retirement so even if you are in a different pension fund and even if you are already doing some other things to take care of yourself in retirement you may want to take a look at the roth ira where you can literally put 2 000 per person into this savings account and at retirement you take the money out tax free it is very significant because 2 000 put in at age say 40 typically will at least triple by the time you reach retirement that means it goes from 2 000 thousand to 6 000 in value when you take it out and there is no tax on that 4 000 on increased value a very very significant change in the tax laws that people should be taking advantage of again the idea here is to encourage savings and encourage people to take care of themselves in retirement then we went on to talk to some others farms roughly 90 percent of the farms transferred from one generation to another in this nation today will no longer have any taxes due because of the tax code change so for small farmers and businessowners you will be able to pass that small business or farm on to the next generation without the tax burden that was there before it is very clear to farmers as you pass this on from one generation to another the benefit but there a hidden benefit in here that not many people have picked up on when a business is held by a family and the family has been running that business for a period of time if the owner of that business cannot pass it on to the next generation many times the business gets sold and somebody else takes over and the jobs are moved out of that community to a different community so by allowing that business to stay in the family and be passed from one generation to another many times that means jobs stay in a community that otherwise might not have stayed there there are so many different provisions in this tax code that provide benefits to the american people that i found by the time i was done we virtually could not find anyone who was not in some way shape or form going tobenefit by this tax code i have left out one other group and that is young couples or young working folks singles couples those folks have the benefit of being able to save for education and their first home in this roth ira that i was just describing where they can then literally take the money out tax free and use it for the down payment on their first home or for college education so again there is a benefit for the young workers the people in their thirties forties and fifties preparing to retire for themselves there is a benefit for seniors who own a home and who want to sell it there is a benefit literally all across the generations here and certainly there are many many benefits for our families contained in the tax cut bill again i would be remiss to talk about these taxcuts without also saying that the budget is balanced first i would like to bring the american people and my colleagues some other good news numbers have come out now that reestimate the revenues coming into the federal government and in fact as we have been saying in our office for quite some time the economy is stronger than people were giving it credit for and revenues are coming in faster what does that mean in english the budget is balanced for the first time since 1969 next year four years ahead of schedule we are on track to balancing the budget the job is done and your taxes are coming down at a great time what a great time this is in this country i never 3 years ago when i was first elected thought we would be in a position to stand here and talk seriously about a balanced budget in 1998 taxes coming down medicare restored welfare reform ablebodied welfare recipients have now to go to work and not heartlessly they are guaranteed a job in wisconsin we are seeing our welfare rolls fall dramatically good news all across the specter in terms of what has happened in the last couple years here in washington with that i would like to turn my attention now to another topic that i find is very confusing as i talk with groups of people a lot of folks are saying if the budget is balanced what about that 5 trillion debt out there it has to be smoke and mirrors because we know there is a 5 trillion debt out there let me explain the difference between two terms the first term is deficit and the second term is debt deficit is like the family with their checkbook deficit is like overdrawing your check book since 1969 each and every year washington has written out more in checks than what it collected in taxes so they have literally overdrawn their checkbook each and every year since 1969 that is called the deficit when they overdrew their checkbook what they did was borrowed the money put it in their checkbook and then of course the checks were cashed and on we went so for each and every year since 1969 they have overdrawn their checkbook and then they went and borrowed the money put in the checkbook and made good on the checks as you might imagine since they have been borrowing more and more money each and every year since 1969 the debt has been growing each and every year and that is the 5 3 trillion we have staring us in the face i am talking now about the debt and how fast it has been growing and i think it is very important that the american people realize that we still have a very significant problem staring us in the face on this chart i show the growing debt facing america from 1960 to 1980 the growth was relatively slow and relatively small that is the deficits were not big because they did not borrow lots of money in each one of those years but from 1980 forward the debt has been growing in large amounts this is what brought many members of the class of 1996 out here the republican class of 1995 we watched this debt grow and realized we were about here on this debt chart right now and that if we dont do something about this as a nation we are not going to have a future in this country that is what brought many of us here in the first place and that is why it is such good news we are going to stop borrowing the money and the red line will quit going up when we reach a balanced budget when i point to 1980 all my colleagues on that side of the aisle say sure that is the year ronald reagan was elected and all my colleagues on this year say yeah i know but that is the year the democrat congress started spending out of control the fact of the matter is it doesnt matter which side it was responsible the fact is we as a nation have this debt staring us in the face and it is not a republican problem or a democrat problem it is an american problem because this government does represent the people it is time that we as a nation solve the problem rather than pass the blame back and forth in the house of representatives and the senate and the presidency for those that have never seen this number this is the amount of money it is 5 3 trillion that is the amount of money that the federal government has borrowed on behalf of the american people this is the accumulation of the overdrawn checkbook the amount of money that was necessary to make the checkbook balance since let rpe translate that into english i used to be a math teacher so you will see some of the math still in here if we divided this debt up by the number of people in the united states of america if each and every american were to pay just their share of the federal debt they would need to pay 20 000 the federal government has borrowed 20 000 on behalf of the every man woman and child in the united states of america basically within the last 15 to 20 years the real problem you look at a family of five like mine my kids are here my wife is here we have got five of us in our house the federal government literally borrowed and spent 100 000 on behalf of my family the real problem the kicker is the bottom line number you see every family of five in the country today or the average family of five is paying 580 a month to do nothingbut pay the interest on this debt this money is owed to people it is a real debt interest is being paid on it the cost of interest alone to a family of five in the united states of america today or any group of five people is 580 a month a lot of people say i do not really pay 580 a month in income tax i dont have to worry about it but it is not only income tax if you do something as simple as walk in the store and buy a loaf of bread the store owner makes a profit on that loaf of bread and of course part of that profit gets sent out here to washington and you guessed it it goes to help pay the interest on the federal debt as a matter of fact one dollar out of every six collected in taxes goes to paying the interest on the federal debt so the real problem with this picture is that there are real people out there real families out there that are paying 580 a month to do nothing but pay the interest on the debt it would be logical to ask the question how in the world did we get into this mess and didnt anybody try to correct it in the past i wanted to talk specifically about the past the past let me define the past to be pre1995 again this is very specific what we are talking about here the american people were promised a balanced budget repeatedly this is not news that all of a sudden we have a 5 trillion debt staring us in the face as a matter of fact the grammrudmanhollings bill first passed in 1985 promised the american people a balanced budget in 1991 well we look at the deficit line in this chart and what actually happened and it is clear that the promise made from washington was broken the promise was not kept but they knew what to do when they couldnt keep the first promise washington made a series of new promises again i emphasize this is the past this is what led many of us into leaving the private sector and coming to washington this blue line shows the fixed grammrudmanhollings bill and it was promising a balanced budget in 1993 i think that 1992 and 1993 those are real important dates to look at out there because you see when the budget was supposed to be balanced instead we had huge and growing deficits so rather than balance the budget as was promised then under this bill when we got to the early 1990s instead we had huge growing deficits so what did washington do in 1993 passed the biggest tax increase in american history washington looked at this picture and concluded that the right answer was to reach into the pockets of the american people and take more money out of their pockets and bring it out here to washington why would they do that well because if they take more money out of the pockets of the american people and bring it out here to washington they can keep their washington spending programs going and still bring the deficit down you see that is what the tax increase of 1993 was all about to pass the tax increase of 1993 what it really allowed them to do is keep spentling going out here in washington again i emphasize this is the past because in 1994 the american people decided to change what was going on in washington d c in 1994 the people for the first time in many many many years elected a republican house of representatives and a republican senate this history of broken promises this history of tax increases that changed in 1995 we had this theory when we came here in 1995 that went like this rather than raising taxes on the people and taking more money out here to washington why dont we slow the growth of spending here in washington have fewer washington spending programs and get to a balanced budget because washington is spending less not because they are taking more money out of the pockets of the american people that was our theory our theory went like this if we can just get washington to spend less money that means they would borrow less money out of the private sector if they borrowed less money out of the private sector of course that means more money available in the private sector more money available in the private sector the law of supply and demand is straightforward the interest rates stay down so if we could just get washington to spend less money they would borrow less money that would leave more money available in the private sector and with more money available the interest rates would stay down if the interest rates stayed down our theory was people would buy more houses buy more cars and of course when people bought more houses and cars that meant other people had to go to work building the houses and cars and that meant job opportunities and less welfare and less cost to the government and more people paying taxes in this was the 1995 theory i think it is more than fair that the american people should at this point start asking how did they do how are the republicans doing they came here in 1995 laid down a plan to balance the budget in 7 years how are they doing i think that is a legitimate question i brought the next chart along to show exactly how the new congress since 1995 is doing the red columns in this chart show the promises that were made in 1995 these are the deficit amounts that the republican congress said we would keep the deficit to in order to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002 i am happy to say that in the first year and this is in this is not a promise an empty promise we not only hit our target but we were about 50 billion ahead of schedule so the good news is in year one the republican plan not only hit our target we were well ahead of schedule year two came year two the change was significant washington borrowed over 100 billion less than was projected out here until year two and it worked exactly the way the theory we had hoped would work that is when washington borrowed less money because their deficit was lower that left 100 billion more money available in the private sector 100 billion more in the private sector kept the interest rates down and sure enough it worked people bought more houses and cars and stoves and refrigerators and all the other things that go with it and that provided job opportunities so the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in years that meant job opportunities for people they went to work and started paying taxes in and of course that made the program go better the rest of this chart was kind of theory a few days ago we found out recently that the theory was way too lacking the optimism that should be there because of the strong economy we are in we are now finding we are going to reach a balanced budget this blue column the actual deficit is going to go to zero sometime between the year 1998 and the year 1999 3 or 4 years ahead of the promise that was made by the republicans back in 1995 is this a change or what before 1995 we had the broken promises of grammrudmanhollings and the higher taxes post1995 well we are 3 years into the plan and are now looking at balancing the budget 3 years ahead of schedule for the first time since 1969 and lowering taxes and restoring medicare at the same time because the idea of constraining the growth of washington spending works a lot of folks say well you are just plain lucky out there in washington you are just plain lucky the economy is booming and since the economy is booming there is more revenue coming in and you guys can get your job done and you all look great out there doing it and everybody is bragging about it i brought with me a chart to show the actual facts on that particular argument as well because i hear that quite a few different places that i go to we have had booming economies in the past in the past every time washington went into a booming economy washington subsequently went into booming spending cycles in fact all the extra revenue that came in they spent it so we never did get the deficit down we never did get to a balanced budget in fact this congress since 1995 is very different we are in a booming economy yes the revenues are coming in stronger than expected but rather than go and spend the extra money this congress has seen fit to slow the growth of washington spending by over 40 percent at the same time the economy remains strong this is how fast washington spending was growing before 1995 this is how fast it is growing since 1995 on through the year 2002 so let us make this very clear in the face of a strong economy and more revenues coming in instead of washington doing what it has always done in the past going and spending the extra money what washington did is at the same time the economy was strong they slowed the growth of washington spending so in the face of a slowed growth of washington spending and a strong economy we hit our deficit targets we are on track we are ahead of schedule and we are about to balance the budget for the first time since 1969 while at the same time lowering taxes and restoring medicare for those that are interested in inflationadjusted dollars it is even more dramatic the washington spending was increasing by 1 8 percent it has now been slowed to 6 percent we are down to a point where washington spending in real dollars has virtually stopped in terms of increasing spending that is good news and that is why we are also able to both balance the budget and reduce taxes at the same time for the good of the american people i brought one more chart with me that i think says it all because a lot of people are saying well how can all of this stuff happen at the same time you know in fact would this all have happened anyhow this chart shows what would have happened if when we got here back in 1995 we had played golf tennis and basketball instead of doing our jobs the deficit line that is shown here in the red this is what we inherited when we got here back in 1995 in fact members can see that the deficits were projected to go all the way up to 350 billion at that point in time a lot of people remember 1995 they remember the 100 days they remember the government shutdowns they remember the hassles and what seemed like a constant battle out here in washington i want to say something i was here it was a constant battle it was worse here living through it than what the american people saw out there in public put at the end of 1995 we had made progress this yellow line in the chart shows what the deficit projections were after one year of very difficult battles the green line shows what we had hoped to do we laid this out in 1995 and again we hoped to get to that balanced budget by the year 2002 the good news is here the good news is what we have actually accomplished is below either one of those projections and in fact we are now going to reach zero right here in the year 1998 or 1999 so not only are we not losing what was given to us in 1995 when we got here but we are going to reach a balanced budget in 1998 or 1999 for the first time in more than a generation again i cannot emphasize this enough the last time the budget was balanced i was a sophomore in high school my son is now a junior in college my daughter is a freshman in college and my youngest is a freshman in high school this is more than a full generation ago the last time we balanced the federal budget it is great news for the future of this country i have been real upbeat and i have been real optimistic about this as well we should be we should be celebrating this first balanced budget in a generation welfare reform taxes coming down medicare restored we should be celebrating this but we would be remiss if we did not recognize that even after we got a balanced budget we still have this 5 3 trillion debt hanging over our head remember when we say the budget is balanced that is just a checkbook all we mean is that we are taking in as many dollars as we are spending in this given year that does not pay this debt off i have good news on that front though too we are working on it we have a plan on the table right now it is called the national debt repayment act what the plan does is this it says after we reach a balanced budget we recognize we still have this huge problem we have a responsibility to future generations to do something about this problem so after we reach a balanced budget we are going to cap the growth of washington spending at a rate of at least 1 percent under the rate of revenue growth so spending is now going up slower than revenue growth with spending going up slower than the rate of revenue growth if you start a balance that creates a surplus with the surplus we take onethird of that surplus and provide additional tax cuts to the american people so the american people should expect a tax cut every year from here on out twothirds of it goes to repaying the federal debt i have great news if we were to enact this plan by the year 2026 the entire federal debt would be repaid and we would pass this nation on to our children debtfree but there is another hidden advantage to doing that as we are paying down the federal debt the money that has been taken out of the social security trust fund would also be returned social security is collecting more dollars than it is paying back out to our senior citizens in benefits each year as a matter of fact this year alone the social security system will collect about 70 billion more in tax revenue than what it is paying back out to our senior citizens in benefits the idea is that money is supposed to be set aside in a savings account so when the baby boom generation gets to retirement you can go to the savings account get the money put it in the checkbook and make good on the social security payments to our senior citizens that money though it is not in that savings account that money is all part of this 5 3 trillion debt what social security is doing is instead of putting the money in the savings account they are collecting the social security tax dollars more than what they are paying out to seniors in benefits they are putting all the money in the general fund in the big government checkbook if you like they are writing out checks out of that checkbook and of course there is no money left at the end that is the deficit then they are simply putting an iou down in the social security trust fund under the national debt repayment act as we go about paying off the federal debt we would also be putting the money back into the social security trust fund so under the national debt repayment act we create a surplus by slowing the growth of washington spending which we have already been successful doing we just continue what we have done for the last 2 years continue it on forward we create that surplus we take onethird of the surplus and work to reduce taxes further each year for the american people we take twothirds and apply it to the federal debt and when we are repaying the debt it is completely repaid by the year 2026 we are also restoring the social security trust fund just think about this it is not only the fact that we are doing the right thing we are paying the bills we have run up over the last generation it is not only that it is not only that we are going to give this nation to our children debt free it goes a step further when the debt goes away 1 out of every 6 that the federal government is now spending no longer needs to be spent that opens the door for huge tax cuts for the american people when we start talking about these tax cuts let us talk about some of the possibilities here because under the national debt repayment act as the debt gets paid down lower interest payments the government needs less money we can now talk about revamping the entire tax system i do not know how all of my colleagues feel and all the listeners this evening feel but many of us do not like the fact that the irs is so complicated it is almost impossible to understand in all fairness the new tax code did not make it any easier it did lower taxes we should not complain about the fact that taxes are coming down but the fact is the irs is far too cumbersome and far too difficult to understand as we look at these tax cuts down the road therefore it gives us the opportunity to throw out the irs as we know it and bring in a new tax system that would be a lot simpler than the one we have today until we get this in hand we cannot do that so the good news under the national debt repayment act and again i would encourage all of my colleagues that are not already on board as cosponsors to join us in the national debt repayment act what it does is it pays off the debt by the year 2026 so our children get this nation debtfree restores the social security trust fund for our senior citizens and for those people in the work force today for those people in the work force today they should expect additional tax cuts each and every year as far as the eye can see it is great news to the american people when we start thinking about the future tax cuts i opened the hour here by talking about the fact that i had listened to a lot of people out there in wisconsin what the people told me when i listened to them is two tax cuts they were most interested in the first one is the marriage tax penalty this is just totally unfair in our society today i could not find anybody who did not think we should not get rid of the marriage tax penalty that works like this if you have 4 people all working in the same place at the same time earning exactly the same salary but two of those people are married to each other and two of those people are not married to each other the two people not married to each other pay less tax than the two people that are married to each other that is called the marriage tax penalty and that is just plain wrong that is one thing i heard the other thing i heard repeatedly is mark just simplify the entire tax code just make it a lot simpler if you are going to do more tax cuts for goodness sakes just cut it across board i can tell the members we are going to look forward to eliminating the marriage tax penalty and work towards an acrosstheboard tax cut for virtually all americans out there so whatever bracket you are in it would be very easy to compute if your taxes went down by 5 percent or 10 percent or whatever the number is i would like to wrap up my part this evening by again going back and just comparing the past the present and the future the past broken promises of the grammrudmanhollings bill the higher taxes of 1990 1993 especially 1993 the biggest tax increase in american history taxes went up with a gasoline tax increase for those who were not paying real close attention the discussion went like well that tax increase is only on the rich but you were rich if you bought gasoline at a gas pump because it went up 4 3 cents a gallon so the tax increases of 1993 the broken promises of a balanced budget of grammrudmanhollings all of these deficits that ran up this huge 5 3 trillion dollar debt that is all in the past in 1994 the american people and the credit should go to the american people the american people changed what was going on they sent a new group out here to run washington under that new group where are we at i think it is a fair question to ask where are we at we are in the third year of a 7year plan to balance the federal budget we are riot only on track we are ahead of schedule we will have our first balanced budget since 1969 next year three or four years ahead of what was promised back in 1995 so for the first time since 1969 the budget will be balanced it has changed here in washington instead of the broken promises of the past we will have a balanced budget for the first time how about the higher taxes of 1993 that is not happening under this congress either as a matter of fact taxes are coming down just to run through that list of tax cuts and what is all in this bill again just briefly 500 per child startingit is 400 next year and goes up to 500 the year after capital gains going from 28 to 20 or even to 10 depending on your income bracket if you sell your home it is your principal residence you have lived there for 2 years in general there will be no taxes on the sale of your home however old you are the onetime exclusion age 55 is no longer there grandparents parents to save up for your childrens education you can put up to 500 per year per child into a savings account the interest accumulates taxfree college tuition for most freshmen and sophomores out there the parents are going to keep 125 a month more that is 125 a month more if you have a freshman or sophomore in college in most cases you keep that money in your house you earned it it is not a gift you earned it it is your money you keep it instead of sending it out here to washington 1 500 is the total for freshmen or sophomores 1 500 and in most cases for a junior or senior it is 1 000 that you keep in your own home if you are in a pension fund today wherever you are if you are saving for retirement if you would like to increase the amount that you are saving for your retirement there is a new ira called the roth ira that most everybody watching tonight my colleagues are eligible for you can put up to 2 000 per year per person into the roth ira for a husband and wife 4 000 a year you put in aftertax dollars which means you have already paid taxes on that money but the good news is the interest accumulates taxfree and when you take it out it is taxfree completely so you put the money in it accumulates and at retirement when you take the money out it is taxfree for young folks if you want to save up to buy a house or college education put money into an ira type account and you are allowed to take it out without the penalty for small businesses and i may not have mentioned this one earlier the health care deduction for selfemployed people is going all the way up to 100 percent over a period of years death taxes are reformed ninety percent of farms are passed from one generation to another with no taxes paid businesses family owned businesses will pass on to the next generation in many cases without taxes so the jobs can stay there in the community the point of this is we are in a very very changed washington dc the tax hike of 1993 versus the tax cut of 1997 that is dramatically different there has been a dramatic change that has been brought on by the american people sending a new group out here to control the house and senate and the american people have a right to understand just how far we have come the present a balanced budget for the first time since 1969 the present tax cuts the first time in 16 years the present medicare restored for our senior citizens the present welfare recipients ablebodied welfare recipients having the opportunity to work so they have a chance at a job promotion and a better life for themselves and their families that is the present it is very very different than it was just a couple of short years ago out here i do not believe the american people fully understand the magnitude of the change yet that is the present where are we going well even after we get the budget balanced even after we started with the first tax reduction in 16 years medicare restored for a decade we still have a 5 3 trillion debt hanging over our heads we have introduced the national debt repayment act which would repay the debt in its entirety by the year 2026 giving this nation to our children debtfree it would restore the social security trust fund for our senior citizens and as it creates surpluses by controlling the growth of washington spending onethird of those surpluses would be used to provide additional tax cuts think what a changed environment this is the budget is balanced taxes coming down and a plan on the table that actually talks about paying off the federal debt instead of how we are going to stop borrowing this money what a changed country this is we as the american people should start having optimistic visions of the future again for our children growth opportunities our kids are going to have opportunities in america just like we did to start from scratch and build a company from the ground up or do what they want to do in this society those opportunities will once again be there because instead of passing them an ever growing debt instead of giving them a legacy of virtual bankruptcy we are now in a position to talk seriously about repaying the debt passing the nation on to our children debtfree restoring social security for our senior citizens and additional tax cuts for people in the work force today that is what this is all about and i sincerely hope that is what my service to this country is all about because it is a worthwhile endeavor if we reach those goals"], [2.6671074010664597e-05, 2.6671074010664597e-05, 0, "i would like to also begin this night by expressing my condolences to the family of our colleague mr capps i cannot count how many times my wife has said to me that she hopes that our 24 years of marriage will allow other folks around us to see that it is all right to find the right person in your life and to spend your entire life together we also have 3 kids and i am sure listening this evening that mr capps certainly provided a role model for many many many people not only in california but all across america married to the same woman for 37 years is something that many people should look to in this nation for a role model again i cannot count how many times my wife sue has said lets hope people see that it is all right to be married to the same person that that is the way things should be again my condolences to their family and to the kids that are involved here this evening i had reserved the hour primarily to talk about some budget matters i guess last week we had a situation develop in our district where we were in dire need of some help from some folks i gave my parents a call my mom and dad said well we are going to be there instantaneously they said they were going to drop everything they were doing so to start tonight rather than start on the budget stuff i thought i would talk about a matter that is of the utmost importance not only to my parents but to other seniors like them all across america it is an issue that has almost been put on the back burner out here in washington and many different fronts and that is social security i thought i would start tonight by talking a little bit about what is happening in social security and then go to a solution as what we need to do about it first what is happening in social security i know many senior citizens rely on social security all across this great nation of ours the social security system in 1983 was set up so that it started collecting more money than what it pays out to seniors in benefits the idea with social security was they would collect this extra money put it aside in a savings account and then when the baby boom generation hit retirement they would go to the savings account get the money they need and still make good on the payments to our senior citizens so it is kind of like you do in your own house where when you have got extra money coming in you put it in a savings account then when you overdraw your checkbook you go to the savings account get the money out and make good on it that is how the social security system is set up in fact in 1996 the social security system collected 418 billion in taxes that is they went into the paychecks of working families all across america and they collected they brought out here to washington 418 billion they only sent out checks to our senior citizens of 353 billion again this is a program that basically is working they collected 418 billion they sent out 353 billion in checks to our senior citizens and that left 65 billion that was supposed to be set aside into the savings account this program if it was run properly if this is what would be happening and it would be run right is working just fine the problem and it should serve as no great surprise that out here in washington when they got that extra 65 billion here is what they did we get the money out here in washington we put it in the big government checkbook in the general fund out here in washington they have been overdrawing the general fund that is the deficit they have overdrawn the checkbook out here where this money has been put every year since 1969 so what they do is they get this 65 billion put it in the general fund then they overdraw the general fund or the checkbook so there is no money left to put into that savings account for social security so what they do instead is simply put an iou down here in the social security trust fund what has happened out here is they have collected this extra money like the system is supposed to work they have paid out the benefits to seniors paid out less than they collected but instead of putting the money into the social security trust fund the way it is supposed to be done they have put it in the general fund instead they spend all the money out of the general fund then at the end of the year they simply make an iou entry into the social security trust fund we have developed legislation in our office and to many of my colleagues this will not seem like it took einstein to figure this out it really did not it is the same thing that every business across america does with any king of a pension fund that is similar to social security here is what our legislation does it simply says that this 65 billion that is collected in social security over and above what is paid out to our senior citizens in benefits be put directly into the social security trust fund it is a very very simple concept and it is what i used to do back when we had a business in the business world before i ran for office again what our legislation would do and it is called the social security preservation act is simply take the extra money that is coming in for social security and actually put it aside in the social security trust fund let me be a little more specific what we would do with this extra 65 billion is we would buy negotiable t bills like any senior citizen in america can go to any bank and buy right now today so instead of having ious down here in the trust fund we would then accumulatd these negotiable treasury bonds a t bill much like anybody in this nation can go to the bank and buy the idea in doing this would be to accumulate this kitty of money the way it was set up the way this system was set up and designed to work if we were to accumulate that kitty of money social security would be safe all the way to the year 2029 by not accumulating that kitty of money there is a shortfall in social security not later than the year 2012 let me say that once more if this money were collected and put down here in the trust fund the way it is supposed to be instead of put into the big government checkbook if it went straight to the trust fund social security as we know it today would be solvent all the way to 2029 under the current system where the money is put into the general fund instead of into the trust fund and all the money is then spent out of that general fund and ious are put in the trust fund that is the current system social security is in serious trouble not later than the year 2012 we can see the urgency of this sort of activity again this bill is called the social security preservation act it seems very fitting tonight that we would mention that when we have cosponsors from both sides of the aisle supporting the social security preservation act i would like to point out also how this impacts the budget process out here in washington because it is very important to understand we are on the verge of having our first balanced budget since 1969 every year since 1969 the people that have been out here in washington have spent more money than what they had in their checkbook that is they overdrew the checkbook when they overdrew the checkbook they went to borrow the money to make good on checks and they have been borrowing money every single year since 1969 here is how the social security system relates to this budgeting process in washington since this extra 65 billion is in their checkbook they call their checkbook balanced even though they are using the social security money as opposed to putting it away where it belongs let me show that in picture form when washington talks about a deficit and they were talking about a fiscal year 1996 deficit of 107 billion what they do not tell you is that in addition to that there is 65 billion that has been taken out of the social security trust fund so the real deficit for 1996 was 172 billion not 107 billion that was reported to the american people what does all that mean balancing the budget for the first time means getting rid of this blue area by washington definition when we say in washington we are going to balance the budget by 2002 we mean the blue area is going to be gone but in that year 2002 to get to a balanced budget they are still taking in that year it would be 104 billion out of the social security trust fund it is very important for people across america to understand that when washington says they are going to get to a balanced budget they will still be using the money out of the social security trust fund in their big general fund checkbook to make that checkbook look balanced so even after we get to a balanced budget we4have a long ways to go to actually restore the social security trust fund i am happy to say we have legislation currently pending that we have written in my office that will put this money that has been taken out of social security back into the social security trust fund we have written the social security preservation act that will start putting the money away immediately in addition to that we have written what is called the national debt repayment act the national debt repayment act looks ahead sees that when we are going to have surpluses takes the surpluses onethird for tax cuts twothirds for debt repayment and as we are repaying that debt the money that has been taken out of the social security trust fund would get put back in the social security trust fund and social security would once again be solvent for our senior citizens i want to turn from there and address the bigger problem and look at just how far we have come in the last 2 years i think it is very important as we talk about this to understand where we were in 1995 when for the first time in a long long time 40 years to be exact republicans took control of the house of representatives and the senate what i have got with me here is a chart that shows the growing debt facing this great nation of ours it is important to see that from 1960 to 1980 the debt grew very little but from 1980 forward this debt has grown right off the chart as a matter of fact in 1995 when we got here it was my first year in office the debt was all the way up here it was a very very serious problem and it was growing fast just to take this out of the partisan realm i realize that when i point to 1980 as the year this thing started climbing rapidly and it is very clear in this picture ttat that is the year it started climbing very rapidly i understand that all the democrats say well thats the year ronald reagan was elected to office therefore its the republicans fault and i understand all the republicans say well its that democrat congress that could not control their spending habits and therefore its the democrats fault the facts are it does not matter whose fault it is it is our responsibility as americans to solve the problem we are here in this chart and it is time that we as americans accept our responsibility and do what is right for future generations in this great nation h9794 c that we live in and solve the problem i used to be a math teacher i guess it is fitting tonight to have another former professor here on the floor i used to teach some college classes as well as junior high and high school we used to use these numbers in our class to talk about how large the debt really is we used to talk about these in our math class and use it for a number of placement discussions this is the amount that the united states government has borrowed on behalf of the american people this is our debt today it iss5 3 trillion again this is what we used to do in our math class we used to divide the debt by the number of people in the united states of america and in fact we would find that the united states government has bor= rowed 20 000 on behalf of every man woman and child in the united states of america let me say that once more because it is a pretty staggering number the united states government on behalf of the american people has borrowed 20 000 on behalf of every man woman and child in the united states of america for a family of 5 like mine that means they have borrowed 100 000 let me say this a different way that means they collected 100 000 less in taxes than what they spent out here in washington basically over the last 20 years for a family of 5 like mine they borrowed 100 000 here is the real kicker in this thing a lot of people out in america go so what so what if the government has borrowed all this money well there are a bunch of answers to the sowhat not the least of which this is our responsibility as a nation to pay back but the sowhat is more immediate than that a family of 5 like ours is sending an average of 580 a month to washington to do nothing but pay the interest on the federal debt a lot of people out there say well thats not us we dont pay 580 a month in taxes they forget that when they walk into the store and do something as simple as buy a loaf of bread that the store owner makes a profit on that loaf of bread and part of that profit gets sent out here to washington d c an average family of 5 in the united states of america today is sending 580 every month to washington to do absolutely nothing but pay the interest on the federal debt that is a very real problem it is a problem that is taking money out of the pockets and the paychecks of workers all across america and it is a problem that we as a nation need to address this is where we were in 1995 and this is really the problem that we came into i think it is important to understand how we got there to point this out i think it is important to think back to the late eighties and early nineties what was going on what sorts of promises were being made to the american people many folks remember the grammrudmanhollings acts s they did the first one in 1985 the second one in 1987 lots of folks remember the promises of the grammrudmanhollings acts so i brought that with me tonight this blue line shows what the grammrudmanhollings act promised to do with the deficit i think it is important to note by 1993 under grammrudmanhollings they promised we would have our first balanced budget since 1969 the red line shows what happened if i get upset when i talk about this it is because this is what brought me out of the private sector and caused me to spend 4 days a week away from my family as opposed to home doing the things i normally do living with my family in janesville wisconsin this red line shows what they did they did not keep their promises they promised we would balance the budget along this blue line but the people here decided they could not control spending and the red line is what they actually did so we get out here to 1993 they see that they have broken their promises and what do they do they say well we cant control spending out here in washington so there is only one thing left to do and that is raise taxes in 1993 we got the biggest tax increase in american history they raised the gasoline tax by 4 3 cents a gallon the kicker with the gasoline tax increase they didnt even spend it to build better roads they spent it on washington spending programs so they got to 1993 and looked at this picture and said well this debt is really growing we have to do something about it the right answer i am going into the pockets of the american people we will collect more money out of their paychecks get it out here to washington and surely surely that will lead us to a balanced budget that was the 1993 solution it was not only the gasoline tax senior citizens might recall that they increased social security taxes on thesocial security money they received all sorts of tax increases were implemented as part of that 1993 tax increase package so this was the picture we were looking at in 1993 promises of a balanced budget that had clearly been broken and the biggest tax increase in american history the american people rose to the occasion and said enough of this we are not going to tolerate this anymore and they sent a new group of people to washington well we have been here for 3 years now came in with that group that came in 1994 and was sworn in in 1995 we have been here for 3 years i think t is reasonable that the american peo i ple start asking what has that group done are they any different or just the same old thing doing the same old thing breaking their promises like i what was going on before 1995 the facts are the american people should be evaluating this congress and s they should be asking the question have they done anything different well i brought the chart with me to show what is going on when we got here in 1995 we laid out a plan to balance the budget as well this blue line shows the promises we made to the american people in fact the blue line shows we were going to get to a balanced budget in 2020 and i have to tell you when i went home to my district and i said we are going to balance the budget by the year 2020 they all went yea sure because they were accustomed to this and the broken promises but the facts are we are now in the third year of our plan to balance the federal budget we are not only on track but ahead of schedule we are so far ahead of schedule in fact that we will have our first balanced budget since 1969 probably in fiscal year 1998 if everything continues the way it has during our first two years in office for one more year we will in fact have our first balanced budget since 1969 we didnt do this while raising taxes we in fact did this coupled with the first tax cut in 16 years i want to spend a little time on the tax cut in just a minute but before i do i wanted to talk about why this picture is possible because when you look at this picture and you understand what led to the change in 1993 that was broken promisesand raising taxes then you look at this picture and you see we are on track balancing the budget probably 4 years ahead of schedule and at the same time reducing taxes a lot of my constituents go mark the economy is so good you guys are out there trying to look good in the face of the great economy we are in that is nice but not entirely true the economy is doing really really well but the reason this picture works is not just cause the economy is doing well we have had good economies between 1969 and today every time in the past when the economy got good in the past washington saw extra money coming in and thiswill not be hard to convince the peopre of because it is so obvious when the econqmy was good in the past and extra money came into washington washington simply created a new washington spending program and spent the money it is important to understand that being in the third year of a sevenyear plan to balance the budget getting to balance four years ahead of schedule and lowering taxes the at the same time partly it is the economy but there is more to it than that the growth of washington spending before we got here was 5 2 percent annually this is how fast spending was growing before we got here in 1995 this is how fast spending is growing now this is a very different picture in the face of a very strong economy with nore revenue than expected coming nto washington this congress said we lre going to slow the growth rate of washington spending we didnt go out lnd come up with a whole bunch of new washington spending programs just the opposite we are squeezing the growth rate of washington spending at the same time there is extra revenue coming in in fact let me give you a couple very little known facts in 1996 our first fiscal year we actually spent 28 billion less than as promised in our second fiscal year we spent 25 billion less than was promised i challenge each one of my colleagues to go and get the budget resolution that we passed back in 1995 do not take my word for it go and get it then see what was promised and see how we actually spent less again when i am out with my constituents and i tell them this i swear half of them get it and check it out because they cant believe it actually happened washington said what they were going to spend and actually spent less money than they said they were going to spend at the same time we were spending less money than we said we were going to spend 100 billion plus of extra revenue came in that is why we have the picture where we are able to both balance the budget ahead of schedule and reduce taxes at the same time this picture is absolutely essential in understanding that it is not only the good economy and the good economy is certainly part of it it is also washington slowing the growth rate at the same time that extra revenue is coming in in fact in real dollars we have slowed the growth rate of washington spending from 1 8 percent to 0 6 percent the growth rate has been slowed by twothirds in two short years this is a monumental accomplishment especially in the face of all the extra revenue that came in here that was unexpected now i am going to go to the next item with this picture still here i am going to go to the next thing that most of our constituents do not understand when i am talking with them out there it is like you are going to cut taxes mark is that another political promise is that where we are at no that is not where we are at the taxes have been cut the bill is signed for the first time in 16 years people should start keeping more of their money rather than sending more of their money to washington d c let me be specific first off this tax cut package is heavily weighted towards education as it should be education is extremely important for the future of this nation it is heavily weighted towards families let me start with the families in january of next year the families with children under the age of 17 keep 400 per child more in their own home rather than sending it out here to washington translation if you have a child under the age of 17 in your home you should go to your place of employment and start keeping 33 a month more in your takehome pay instead of sending it to washington d c 33 a month well that is 400 divided up over the 12 months you can start keeping the extra money in january of next year there are 550 000 families in wisconsin alone eligible for this 400 per child tax cut but i have a fear i have a fear that people will not believe the tax cut package is real and they will send all that money out to washington instead of keeping it in their home they will not make the effort in january to go in and actually keep the extra 33 in their own paycheck instead of sending it out here i am very much afraid of what is going to happen if washington gets their hands on the money so i would strongly encourage all of our constituents to go in and change their withholding so they keep that extra money in their own home education we would hope a lot of families and i know i was talking with a family at church with three kids i know the first thing they said to me is mark when i get that 400 i know exactly what i am doing i am putting it into a savings account to save for my kids education good news we have established something called an education savings account that works much like an ira you can put up to 500 per year per child into an education savings account to save up for the kids as they are growing up for when they reach college age now i a lot of times call this the grandparents account there are a lot of grandparents that talk to me ard say we wish we could do something for our grandkids well the account is set up so that the grandparents could literally put up to 500 per grandchild away to save up for the kids education when they reach the age of 18 what better gift from a grandparent to a grandson or a granddaughter so the education savings accounts i think are very very important but we did not stop there we understand that for many working families out there when the first or second or third child goes off to college paying those college tuition bills are very very difficult and a huge burden on our families so the tax cut package also contains a college tuition credit of up to 1 500 per college student in the vast majority of the cases if you have a freshman or a sophomore in college next year you will send 1 500 less to washington you will keep it in your own home and use to help pay for the kids college education for a freshman or sophomore you get the first 1 000 plus half of the second 1 000 or 1 500 total for juniors and seniors it is 20 percent of the first 5 000 up to 1 000 total it is interesting with this 1 000 college tuition credit i was out at a meeting i believe in waukesha wisconsin and somebody came up to me and she said well we are married we are both working and i am going back to school does the college tuition that i pay this is now a young couple does the college tuition that i pay qualify for a 20 percent reduction in my taxes do i get my 20 percent back the answer to that question is yes the answer to that question is if you are a young married couple and one or both of the spouses has returned to college or tech school for purposes of bettering themselves and making themselves also qualified so they can get a job promotion and provide a better life for themselves and their family if that is going on does that college tuition cost qualify for the 20 percent tax credit the answer is definitively yes it does i want to make it very clear here we are not talking about a tax deduction we are talking about a tax credit you fill out your taxes you figure out how much you would have paid in taxes and you subtract this number off the bottom line this is not a deduction this is a tax credit figure out how much tax also you owe subtract 400 per child let me put this another way for a family of five whether they be in janesville wisconsin or wherever in this great nation of ours you have two kids at home and one off at college that family will be pay 2 300 less in taxes next year this is real money this is not a political promise this is a bill that has been signed into law the tax cut package is passed a family of five three kids one is a freshman in college and two still at home will literally pay 2 300 less in taxes next year translation instead of sending 2 300 to washington out of their paycheck you keep the 2 300 in your own home i would like to have anyone stand up and explain to me why it is they think that washington can spend that 2 300 better than that family of five out there in america because that is what this is really all about there are very few people that voted against the tax cut package on either side of the aisle i might add i had a call this morning or yesterday actually and i was reading it this morning from one of our constituents that talked about how there is help all the way through government except for those hardworking families struggling to make ends meet well i would point out that the 400 per child the college tuition tax credit the education savings account those are all aimed specifically at those folks let us try one more thing though for the young couples or for the young singles that are working because i hear a lot about this that there is nothing in this for a young couple or a single who is working there are actually several things that impact that group very specifically there is what is called the roth ira you see we find many of our young couples or singles that are saving for either future education or to buy their first home in the roth ira it works much like an ira you can put up to 2 000 per year per person into the roth ira if you do not take the money out between then and retirement the money accumulates the interest and dividends whatever you have put it into accumulates taxfree all the way to retirement and at retirement you take the money out absolutely tax free however for those young couples or for those young singles in the work force if you decide that you would like to buy a home you can take out up to 10 000 out of this account specifically for the purpose of buying your first home if you decide you want to go back to college and further your education or tech school and further your education so that you can qualify for a job promotion a better life for yourself and your family you can literally go into the roth ira take the money out and use it so you put the money away into a savings account the money accumulates taxfree and then you can take it back out for a firsttime home purchase for education or if you do not take it out at retirement you can take it out then absolutely taxfree this is also a very important feature for many of the emptynesters the folks whose kids are grown and gone typically they are in a 401 k at their place of employment already and they are looking at this tax cut package going saying what is there available for me the roth ira is the real answer even if you are in a 401 k and this is very new as it relates to iras even if you are in a 401 k already you still qualify for the roth ira you can start saving additional money for your own retirement remember whatever accumulates in this roth ira when you reach retirement you take it out absolutely taxfree a couple of other things in this taxcut package that i think are worth mentioning always keeping this picture in mind and understanding that the reason we are able to cut taxes is because we have slowed the growth rate of washington spending at the same time the economy is very strong it is this picture that has put us in this position where we can have this great discussion about the fact that the budget is balanced for the first time since 1969 and we are lowering taxes for folks that own their own home and have lived in that home for 2 years or more and this affects many many senior citizens you may now sell that home and not owe any federal taxes in the vast majority of the cases let me say that once more for your personal residence if you have lived there 2 years or longer in the vast majority of cases there will be absolutely no taxes due this affects all sorts of folks in our society if a person is in a place of employment and they have an opportunity to take a better job and provide a better life for themselves and their families and they take this job transfer that requires them to sell their home in the past they may have suffered a capital gains debt to the federal government when they sold their home now if they have lived in that home for 2 years there are no taxes due it also affects senior citizens in many many many cases many senior citizens took their onetime exclusion when they reached age 55 they then sold the bigger house that probably they raised theirkids in and bought a smaller home and they are still in that home but since they have used their onetime exclusion when they sell that home that home has appreciated in value and they would have owed taxes to the federal government on that appreciation not anymore there is no more onetime exclusion at age 55 even if you took the onetime exclusion our senior citizens can now sell that home that they moved into after the age of 55 at the appreciated value and pay no money to the federal government in taxes this is a major major change capital gains we are finding today that more and more people are starting to save for themselves and their own retirement the capital gains tax rate in most cases has been reduced from 28 to 20 percent for the folks in the lower income bracket who have saved for their retirement to take money out that has been in a capital gains situation it has been lowered from 15 percent to 10 percent so if you are in a 41 000ayear income bracket and you take money out that is treated as capital gains the rate dropped from 15 to 10 if you are over the 41 000 the rate dropped from 28 to 20 the good news is it is going down to 18 i would be remiss not mentioning the changes for farmers and small business owners passing those businesses to the next generation i cannot tell members how many folks have talked to me in my district about the fact that when they want to pass a farm on from one generation to the next but the tax burden is so great that they cannot possibly do it under the tax code that has been changed and 90 percent of all farms may be passed from one generation to the next without paying federal tax on it this tax break also applies to many of our small businesses i have kind of stopped in the middle of this bigger discussion of what was going on back in 1993 and before broken promises and not getting to a balanced budget the tax increases of 1993 and how things have changed in fact we have slowed the growth of washington spending in the face of a very strong economy and that in fact has actually led us to both a balanced budget 4 years ahead of schedule and the opportunity to have these tax cuts that i just talked about this is a wonderful wonderful situation to be in in terms of a change that has occurred out here in washington in 3 short years the next thing i get from my constituents back home is typically well mark it is not your doing if you had done nothing this all would have happened anyhow so i brought aibther chart with me to show exactly what would have happened if in fact when we got here in 1995 we played golf and tennis or basketball and did not do our job this red deficit line shows in my first year this is where the deficit was going when i got here this red line shows what would have happened had we not done our job the yellow line shows where we were at the end of 1 year so after a year of struggle we had brought this red line down to the location of the yellow line but we had a dream we had a dream that we could actually balance the budget and lower taxes at the same time restore medicare for our senior citizens that was our dream this green line shows that dream that green line shows how we were going to get to our balanced budget by 2002 the blue line shows what is actually happening again we can see what would have happened had we done nothing what would have happened had we quit at the end of 12 months what we hoped to do that is the green line and what is actually happening again we are in the third year of this plan to balance the budget in 7 years we are so far ahead of schedule that it would now appear that in the fiscal year 1998 we will reach our first balanced budget in more than a generation i was a sophomore in high school the last time the federal budget was balanced so this is good news i think it is important that we understand that we are winning we are winning the battle of getting to a balanced budget but i do not think we should forget the earlier conversation about social security i began the hour this evening by talking about social security and how the money that is supposed to be in that social security trust fund that extra money that has been collected that was supposed to be set aside has been spent on all sorts of different washington programs and how even after we get to a balanced budget they are still using that social security money i would like to now present the longterm solution to getting that money that has been spent back into the social security trust fund and the bigger picture here is to not only get the money back in the social security trust fund but to pay off that 5 3 trillion debt that has been run up so that our children can in fact leave this nation absolutely debtfree that is my dream for the future of the country my dream for the future of the country and for the next 10 15 20 years of our generations time here serving our nation my dream is that we will actually pay down the federal debt restore the social security trust fund and continue to lower taxes on our working families and our workers all across america here is the plan here is how it works it is called the national debt repayment act remember it has three purposes for workers lower taxes for senior citizens restore the social security money and most important of all for our children give them a nation that is debtfree let our legacy to the next generation be that we have actually paid off the federal debt much like you would pay off a home mortgage in the business i used to be ih where we used to build homes here is how it works after we reach a balanced budget we cap the growth of washington spending at a rate at least 1 percent lower than the rate of revenue growth after we reach balance that is this point in the chart we cap the growth of washington spending that is the red line at a rate at least 1 percent slower than the rate of revenue growth that is the blue line that in fact creates a surplus it is pretty easy to see in this chart if spending is going up at a slower rate than revenue grows it does in fact create this surplus we use the surplus in two ways onethird of that surplus is dedicated to additional tax cuts for the workers i might add while we are on this onethird there is a bill introduced here that i am a strong supporter of and a cosponsor of that would literally sunset the irs tax code as we know it today when i went through all of these tax cuts a lot of my constituents back home will say mark that is very complicated to understand all that they are right there are 20 volumes of tax code today there are 20 000 pages of tax code i challenge anyone to fully understand what is in that tax code so as we talk about these tax cuts as we talk about using onethird of this surplus and dedicating that to additional tax reductions for workers all across america as we have that discussion i think it is important that we throw in the mix that we would like to sunset the irs tax code as we know it today and replace it with a system that is simpler fairer and easier for people to understand the bill currently would sunset the tax code as we know it today in the year 2001 i think that is a great idea why 2001 instead of tomorrow i think we need to have a discussion and come up with a system that is in fact simpler fairer and easier to understand when i am out in our town hall meetings a lot of my constituents start nodding their head with the yes sure thing again but the reality is if we can actually balance the budget 3 or 4 years ahead of schedule if we can lower taxes for the first time in 16 years and make that tax cut very very real is it that hard to believe that we can also change the irs system so it is simpler fairer and easier for folks to understand certainly redoing the irs code is easier than getting to a balanced budget certainly redoing the irs code is easier than getting the people in this community to start spending at a slower growth rate it has got to be easier to redo the irs it is going to get done i am very optimistic as we talk about using onethird of these for tax cuts it will facilitate that move to an easier simpler tax system a fairer tax system the other twothirds of this surplus remember we cap the growth of washington spending at least 1 percent below the rate of revenue growth that creates a surplus onethird is dedicated to tax cuts twothirds is used to repay the federal debt this works much like paying off a home mortgage i used to be a homebuilder when folks would buyone of our homes the last thing we would do is go to a bank and they would sign a mortgage on their home and they would then start making payments on their home on a very regular basis over a 30year period of time they would pay off the mortgage that is exactly what we are suggesting that we do with the federal debt in fact under this bill if we enact it the way it is written cap the growth of washington spending at least 1 percent slower than the growth rate of revenue we would in fact pay off the entire federal debt by the year 2026 it is a 29year period of time folks are very familiar with the 30year home mortgage so it is like you set up on a repayment plan of the home mortgage and whatever is left over gets returned the people in the form of tax cuts that is what our bill does again it is called tv national debt repayment act i think it is real important for us to understand that as we are repaying that federal debt as we are paying off the 5 3 trillion part of that 5 3 trillion is the social security trust fund so as we go through this plan and we actually pay off the federal debt the money that has been taken out of social security and spent on all kinds of other washington programs in fact gets repaid to the social security trust fund in repaying the money to the social security trust fund social security once again becomes solvent for our senior citizens all the way to the year this has another impact and it is a very very real impact remember the 580 a month that an average family of five is paying to do nothing but pay the interest on the federal debt as we go down this road and we start paying down the federal debt each time we make a payment on the federal debt that means there is less interest due the next year so the idea here is that as we go through this and we start paying down the federal debt each year we should be able to cut taxes even further because there will be less interest that needs to be collected from our working families think about this for a dream for the future of our country think about a dream where we actually pay off the federal debt we leave our children a legacy of a debtfree nation we restore social security for our senior citizens and each and every year as we go forward we take onethird of this surplus and we lower the tax rate on our workers all across america people talk about the problem in medicare when i came here in 1995 medicare was scheduled to be bankrupt in the year 2001 no one in america i cannot believe anyone in this entire country missed the mediscare ads that were run during the last 2year period of time whereall sorts of misinformation was put out about the medicare system but the one thing that was true was that if absolutely nothing was done it would have been bankrupt in the year 2001 we have restored medicare for at least a decade but at least a decade is not good enough for medicare i would like to point out that as we go through this program and we pay down the debt the money that is no longer needed for interest we can use for tax cuts but certainly we would prevent the medicare system from going bankrupt after that decade that it has currently been restored for so we can now count the medicare program without going into the pockets of the workers taking more money and raising taxes again this dream for the future of this country it includes a restored social security for our senior citizens it includes medicare for our senior citizens it includes a nation where our children inherit this country absolutely debtfree it includes a legacy of a debtfree nation for the workers out there they are not forgotten for the workers out there who have borne this huge tax burden taxes can come down each and every year as we go forward do not forget the other part of this where we reform the irs tax code we dump the tax code we have right now lock stock and barrel and put in a new tax system that is easier simpler and something that people can understand and maybe they can even fill out their own taxes again i would like to kind of wrap it up tonight by just summarizing what we talked about i started the hour tonight talking about social security and how the social security system is collecting more money than it is paying back out to our senior citizens in benefits each year but that money is currently being spent on other washington programs that is wrong that needs to be stopped we talked about how this thing started happening we talked about in fact how up through 1993 there had been promise after promise after promise the grammrudmanhollings bills grammrudmanhollings ii in 1993 the 1990 tax pledge our balanced budget pledge the 1993 balanced budget pledge promise after promise after promise of a balanced budget that never materialized the past contained broken promises of a balanced budget and the final straw came in 1993 when they raised the gasoline tax and they did not spend the money in building roads when they raised social security taxes that was the final straw people finally said enough we have had it with the broken promises we have had it with tax increases we want washington to get their house in order and control the growth of washington spending we want a smaller washington less involved in our lives that happened in 1994 when they put a new group in charge we are now 3 years into a 7year plan to balance the federal budget i am happy to report that in the third year we will probably reach a balanced budget this year but certainly 3 or 4 years ahead of schedule we are not only on track to balancing the budget keeping our promise but we are 3 or 4 years ahead of schedule we are going toreach our first balanced budget this year since 1969 and at the same time we are reaching that balanced budget we are providing the first tax cut in 16 years a tax cut that is heavily weighed toward families and education 400 per child under the age of 17 1 500 college tuition credit freshmen and sophomores 1 oo college tuition credit for continuing education beyond the freshman or sophomore year the roth ira to save for education for a first home or for retirement that when investors take the money out it is absolutely tax free the money accumulates tax free and when they take it out it is tax free these are very very real tax cuts not a political promise the tax cut bill has been signed into law it is done it is the law taxes are going down for the first time in 16 years think of this contrast broken promises of a balanced budget before 1995 higher taxes 1993 the biggest tax increase in american history a balanced budget first time since 1969 three years into our 7year plan we hit balance tax cut first time in 16 years it is significant it is real it is done what a changed place washington actually is as we stand here but we are not done this is not the end of the picture this is not over we still have dreams for the future of this country and where we are going our dream is not only to get to a balanced budget but to pay off that federal debt and in paying off the debt we restore the social security trust fund in paying off the debt we put ourselves in a position to allow us to pass this great nation on to our children absolutely debt free a legacy of a debt free nation for our children equally important as we are going through that process we gradually reduce the tax burden on our working families and our workers all across america that is our dream for the future of this great nation that we live in"], [2.856181345123332e-05, 2.856181345123332e-05, 0, "for purposes of debate only i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts

testimony and evidence put forth by the house judiciary committee i also met with and heard from many constituents regarding their thoughts and opinions about the actions and conduct of the president upon reviewing all the evidence and testimony before the house judiciary committee it is my sincere belief that substantial and credible evidence exits that the president committed high crimes and

the whole truth and nothing but the truth is a very serious offense for anyone the president does not have any great rights that any other citizen of this country when it comes to the rule of law and preservation of justice the united states system of law and order requires one standard for all and is dependent upon truth while under oath when a person testifies in court to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth there is no exception to that oath it applies to all matters whether they be personal embrassing or considered a little thing president clintons willful lies under oath before a federal judge and grand jury are a direct assault on our nations democracy this undermines our legal process and is a violation of the presidential oath of office the evidence demonstrates that the president has sustained a pattern of perjury obstruction of justice and abuse of power in december 1997 the president willfully and knowingly lied under oath in his written answers to a federal court in january 1998 the president willfully and knowingly lied under oath repeatedly in the paula fones deposition then he willfully and knowingly used his office to influence witnesses and obstruct justice in the jones lawsuit in august 1998 he willfully and knowingly lied to a federal grand jury and he willfully and knowingly lied when he purported to answer the 81 questions posed to him by the house judiciary committee president clinton is said by many who know him best to have a phenomenal memory his friend vernon jordon said the president has an extraordinary memory one of the greatest memories he has ever seen in a politician however in more than four hours of videotaped testimony before a federal grand jury the president testified under oath on more than 100 occasions that he could not remember details involving his relationship with ms lewinsky when a person testifies under oath that he does not remember something when in fact he does he has lied under oath during this one year period president clinton had innumerable opportunities to tell the truth yet he continued to willfully and knowingly put his own self interest before that of justice and the good of the nation to this day he has yet to acknowledge that he committed a crime or show remorse for his actions we can not allow the actions of the president to teach contempt for the law

point that republicans he said were perceived as not liking children not liking senior citizens and now not liking flood victims i do not know whether that is the case maybe that is his feeling and his concern he also observed that both sides of the house have added things to emergency relief bills in the past and cited a new york times article which i have not read but which i know to be true that is the case there is always the time when a bill that should pass and most of us believe must pass and be signed in this case the belief for those who have been ravaged by rains and flood and who are at risk and what this nation wants to help everybody believes this bill ought to pass and it ought to pass quickly but lest my colleagues or anybody else be confused that this is the regular course of business let me reflect a little bit on history it took just 15 days to provide the assistance that president bush asked this congress to give for the victims of hurricane andrew we are now in the 83rd day it was not that president bush and the congress then led by democrats controlled by democrats agreed on everything that was not the case but what president bush and the democratic congress did agree on was that it was our responsibility to pass that emergency relief in a timely fashion 15 days as opposed to the 83 days that this bill has languished in this congress and why does this bill languish why does a bill that everybody said should pass and must pass not pass it is because the leadership of this house and the leadership of the senate has determined that they want to stare down the president that they want to muscle the president that they want to leverage the president and they have taken hostage the victims of the floods of these past months in order to accomplish that objective my colleagues have heard the issues discussed there are two principal ones one is called a continuing resolution and it is put forth by the republicans in this house and in the senate as an effort to prevent government shutdown i represent 56 000 federal employees i am for preventing government shutdown in point of fact it was in the last congress for the first time since i have been serving since 1981 that we consciously and purposefully shut down the government the republican leadership said in april of 1995 they were going to do that they reiterated that in july of 1995 and sure enough on november 19 1995 they shut down the government looked the president in the eye and said if you do not do it my way we will do it no way that is not what the people sent us here to do they sent us here to work together the fact of the matter is that when we did work together we passed appropriation bills and we opened the government after 2 long shutdowns consciously planned by the republican majority to force the president to do something that he said he was not going to do that never happened when the republicans were in control in the 1980s and the first 2 years of the 1990s and democrats controlled this congress were there differences yes did the democrats try to get advantage on the republican president yes but did there come a time when they said that they would not move that they would be immovable in the face of presidential opposition the answer is no when president clinton asked for relief for the midwest floods just in the last congress it just took us 29 days less than one half of the time that this bill has languished in this house and in the senate the other issue that the republicans talk about as being a must add to the emergency relief for flood victims is this sampling issue it is all about politics because republicans have been quoted as saying if we allow sampling and the count that will result we will find poor people we will find minorities and we are afraid that they will vote for democrats and that will be to our political disadvantage so the speaker of the house who two years ago said that he thought sampling made sense and ought to be pursued has changed his position and who suffers the victims of the rain and the floods are held hostage as this political dispute is engaged a number of us have risen on this floor tonight a number of us are rising throughout this city and talking to the press talking to the public and talking yes to our colleagues we have a budget agreement we sat down and for 5 months worked out a very tough problem i supported it that is the proper process not to hold hostage either government employees or flood victims or some other group and say we will hold their relief in abeyance if they do not agree with us yes we urge the leadership of this house and the senate to bring to this floor a clean continuing resolution relief for flood victims support for our troops in bosnia and around the world pass that the president will sign it we can pass it by 12 noon tomorrow and the president will sign it by tomorrow afternoon that is what we ought to do let us be

to support local communities in their decisions under this bill the emphasis is placed on providing the most service for the least cost and tailoring federal assistance to fit local needs so the limited federal resources are invested in ways that are likely to achieve the greatest return fundamental to the bill is the belief that those who receive federal assistance share a responsibility and
