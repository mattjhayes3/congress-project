the women survived the attack her uterus split open expelling the baby into her mothers abdominal cavity where the baby died the man was arrested and charged with several criminal offenses for the attack however air force prosecutors concluded that they could not charge him with a separate offense for killing the baby because although ohio law recognizes an unborn child as a victim federal law does not in 1998 that judgment was concurred in the unitedstates air force court of criminal appeals ruling on that case the court said federal homicide statutes reach only the killing of a born human

thank my colleague from pennsylvania for his concern and for his time tonight for us to talk about some of this inappropriateness and lack of action by this goreclinton administration i would like first for my colleagues to know that i stand tonight not for political reasons but because of an emotional concern a lifelong emotional concern about small towns and rural areas of this country yes our farms and our agriculture interests also throughout this nation let me share with my colleagues i loved agriculture to the point in small town rural america but even to the point that i majored in agriculture when i went off to college i got a couple of degrees in agriculture so i stand with this emotional concern not just political concern back when i served as state president of the oklahoma future farmers of america i would stand and i shared 16 percent of our people were in production of agriculture in the united states 4 years later when i received the outstanding agriculture student award at oklahoma state university i stood up and said there is only 122 percent of us in the production of agriculture in the united states tonight as i stand before my colleagues i say there is only 1 5 percent of people in the production of agriculture that is the erosion that has taken place in rural america there is no other way i can paint the picture any better not too long ago earlier this year i was invited to speak on agriculture before the farm credit association in oklahoma they wanted to know the title of my speech i usually do not have a title but i said if you need to have a title you can state it is american agriculture changing from the pto to the wto now pto stands for the power takeoff on the tractors which allowed us to get bigger farms and bigger units and allowed us to produce the food and fiber for this country we can produce our big problem is being able to sell and now we have the world trade organization that we must be able to market through 135 countries around this world and we cannot forfeit those markets let me share with my colleagues something on an inappropriate activity that took place in the uruguay rounds back in 1993 under this administrations united states trade representative at the uruguay rounds they basically had resolved all of the various disagreements in trade and it came down to agriculture and they could not agree on settling their difference in agriculture they established a peace clause now that sounds good a peace clause however what did it do actually the peace clause of the uruguay rounds the gatt talks established and grandfathered in over 7 billion of subsidies for the european union we only have about 100 million and there is a lot of differences in 100 million and 7 billion of subsidies which allows the european union to grab our markets preventing us from being able to sell around the world in many cases i can go on and on and talk about agriculture but i had to make that point but i stand with a sadness tonight because i see what is happening is just pure politics concerning the energy industry the vice president attacks the fossil fuel industry but i would like to point out to the american people and to my colleagues he has no alternatives he has no other options except to attack that would endanger us even more one of our colleagues earlier from florida stated the fact that we now import about 56 percent of our energy from oil from foreign sources compared to that or less than 40 percent back there in the oil barrel embargo we are becoming more dependent let me say i submit to my colleagues i submit to the american people that today we are more dependent than we ever have been at a time when we think we are independent we are more dependent on a viable source of oil supply for this country and the fact remains under the 8 years of the goreclinton administration they have not developed a national energy policy for the protection of this country we have not moved forward to try to make sure we secure the energy and develop the energy for this nation the fossil fuel as well as the renewable energy we still have today more fossil fuel reserves in the ground than we have mined or drilled and taken from the ground it is a matter of us having a policy that will allow us to move forward so the people of this nation need to know our national security is at stake yes we have a volatile energy policy it appears to say the least when it goes from 20 down to 8 which not only disturbed the energy patch it literally took nearly 100 000 of employees out of the rural areas of this country that were producing the energy for our nation it is hurting the consumers i have suggested that we reached out in a bipartisan way and we come together and we develop a national energy policy that would stabilize fuel prices in an amount we can all work with and live with and let us produce the nations needed energy to do no less is making us subject to blackmail we have seen this go overseas to opec and get on bended knee and beg that is unamerican let me say it hurts not only the consumers in the urban centers of this country but devastates rural america i hope and i pray that we will move forward and i hope and pray that we do quickly because the future of our children and our grandchildren are at stake and the future of our country is at stake i say to the gentleman from pennsylvania i think the gentleman is lifting an issue of rural america and the lack of support the lack of effort being made in the energy and agriculture and other
