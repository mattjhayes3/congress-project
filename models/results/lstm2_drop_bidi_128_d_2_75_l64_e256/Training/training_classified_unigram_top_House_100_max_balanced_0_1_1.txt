act mandated the postal service to cut 1 2 billion from its budget because of these cuts the cost of a firstclass stamp has been raised there has been a significant reduction in postal construction

the freshwater in the united states 95 percent of the drinking water supply in rural areas such as i represent and 40 percent of the water used for agricultural irrigation while the unitedstates

report on ground water quality noted 8 000 public and private wells closed or otherwise affected by ground water contamination contamination has been found in every state this contamination can be traced both to natural sources and to mans activities i believe that one thing agricultural areas can do right now to protect ground water is to more carefully manage the application of fertilizers the nitrogen found in ground water comes from many sources including septic tanks and the biological processes of some legumes however fertilizer also contributes to the nitrogen contamination of ground water i believe that by encouraging agricultural nitrogen best management practices we can reduce the amount of nitrogen getting into the ground water supply the committee on energy and

beyond scope of testing permitted by the certificate of waiver this bill also contains a provision relating to fees which differs slightly from that contained in h r 5150 the provision in this bill is identical to the h r 5150 provision in that it requires that fees be set at levels necessary to recover the total cost of carrying out section 353 of the public health service act the new provision simply clarifies the criteria that are to be used in establishing the fees the bill would add a clarification with regard to the secretarys authority in dealing with laboratories that fail the
