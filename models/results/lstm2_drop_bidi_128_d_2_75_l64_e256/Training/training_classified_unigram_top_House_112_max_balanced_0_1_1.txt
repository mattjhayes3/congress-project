spending while the appropriations committee deserves credit for getting an agreement on the three appropriations bills in this measure im concerned where we are headed on spending based on the use of disaster funding and the potential use of temporary mandatory savings to permanently increase the base of discretionary spending the bill also includes damaging housing policies that contributed along with many government policies to recent financial crises and increases the financial exposure of the federal government instead of advancing solutions in the face of this crisis the president has not put forward a credible budget and the senate under democratic leadership has failed to pass a budget in over 930 days despite their failure to produce a budget they are working hard to increase deficit spending the house of representatives actually passed a budget the path to prosperity which would put us on a path to balancing the budget and saving and strengthening critical programs such as medicarewithout resorting to trillion dollar tax hikes that will damage our economy and hinder job growth we passed the budget control act bca to cut nearly one trillion of dollars in spending and impose statutory caps on future appropriations under chairman rogers leadership we also cut fiscal year 2011 spending to begin to bring spending under control today we consider h r 2112 the conference report on three appropriations bills agriculture commerce justice and science and transportation housing and urban development republicans control the house but with the senate and the white house controlled by leaders who want to increase spending and not reduce it our ability to address this problem is limited i know our appropriations committee has worked hard to try to hold the line on spending despite the challenges our appropriations committee faced i have serious concerns regarding the precedent it sets for future spending h r 2112 provides a total of 130 4 billion in new spending including 2 3 billion of disaster relief funding excluding the disaster funding the bills are 757 million below the levels funded in 2011 including the disaster relief funding the bills are 1 6 billion above the 2011 levels in addition this bill uses changes in mandatory spending chimps which are temporary savings to offset what i fear will be a permanent increase in the base of nondefense spending in the housepassed budget we set a total limit on appropriations of 1 019 trillion for fy 2012 in the budget control act we increased that limit to 1 043 trillion and got statutory limits on spending for 10 years producing nearly 1 trillion in spending reductions over 10 years this bill puts us potentially on a very troubling path the bca established a new exception to allow funds congress designates as being for disaster relief to be added on top of the discretionary caps there is no mandate to increase spending above 1 043 trillion it is entirely in our control and there are conceivably circumstances in which a disaster could be of such severity or immediacy that congress could choose to provide relief funding above and beyond the discretionary caps but given the seriousness of the nations fiscal problems such funding should be limited to only the most exigent circumstances instead the administration and senate democrats have insisted on using this disaster relief loophole in a way that if not closely monitored will undo the hardwon savings contained in the bca the budget control act language allows for the discretionary cap to be raised by as much as the historical average of past disaster spending which for fiscal year 2012 would amount to a maximum adjustment of 11 3 billion but rather than reserving this breathing space for truly dire emergencies the senate took this as an opportunity to stretch this exception to cover a number of programs that are not considered our primary disaster relief programs the primary means for providing immediate disaster relief is through femas disaster relief fund drf which will be included in a future appropriations bill and for which the administration requests another 7 billion but senate democrats have expanded disaster relief to programs such as funding for the economic development administration community development block grants and agricultural grants this is funding in this one bill alone my concern is that the senate and administration will push the disaster relief exception to add even more funding in future bills as a means of spending above the caps we agreed to as part of the debt limit the bill also includes 9 1 billion in changes in mandatory program spending chimps that score as savings in the budget year but that may not actually reduce costs for taxpayers one provision in this bill related to the crime victims fund creates nominal savings of 6 6 billion this year essentially offsetting 6 6 billion of other spending in the bill but all of these savings are reversed in 2013 to the appropriations committees credit this bill makes some progress in reducing the use of these savings gimmicksreducing the use of these chimps by about 1 billion compared to last years bills but further vigilance is warranted in the use of such budgetary maneuvers lastly this bill includes a housing rider increasing conforming loan limits for the federal housing administration increasing the federal role in housing markets in this case by increasing housing subsidies is bad policy it increases risk and exposure to the taxpayer who will have to pay for nonperforming loans bailouts of fannie and freddie have cost taxpayers to date about 170 billion due to risky loans in their portfolios we have to offer real leadership in budgeting if we are to successfully resolve our fiscal challenges this bill reflects the compromises inherent in divided government and we should recognize it both for the progress it makes and for how much further we have to go"],

visited our office and i said whats wrong with this bill he said everything he said if this bill were law when i invented the mri today we would not have the mri there are a lot of problems with this bill this is my fourth patent fight with my esteemed colleague from texas but we do agree on most issues but now we have two persons who simply disagree on policy back in 2004 when i chaired the small business committee i was instrumental in putting in a fixedfee structure for small businesses and to do that i had stricken from the bill the authority of the pto director to set fees this new bill gives to the pto director the ability to set fees even though the initial filing fees for small businesses have been lowered the problem is that the pto can come in and simply raise fees to socall manage their operations in fact two reports the 21st century strategic plan filed in june of 2002 by the unitedstates pto said fees were based upon a highly progressive system aimed at strictly limiting applications containing very high numbers of claims and also the same thing in 2007 their idea of decreasing claims in the patent office is to raise fees obviously whos that going to hurt its going to be the little guy and thats why its one of many reasons i oppose this bill but we should not delegate the authority that congress has to set fees in one of the few constitutional functions that we have in this body over to somebody who has already stated that hes going to raise fees you raise fees guess who gets hurtthe future ray damadian the little inventor the people who invent things in this country the true creators of jobs i rise in strong opposition to this antiinnovation bill i believe this bill will stifle job creation and is unconstitutional over the past 40 years the value of corporations has shifted from tangible assets such as real estate and machinery to intellectual property during this same time period the primary source of all net new job creation has come from startup small companies however since the first major change to our patent system in 1994 that altered the length of the patent from 17 years from award to 20 years from filing the number of patent awards from startups and small individual inventors has dropped dramatically patents awarded to startup firms decreased from 30 percent of all awards in 1993 to 18 percent in 2009 patents awarded to small inventors dropped from 12 percent in 1993 to 5 percent in 2009 why america has slowly shifted towards a europeanstyle patent system which gives more opportunities to challenge a patent resulting in delays in receiving approval for granting a patent thus shortening the length of the exclusive use of the patent now the average wait is three years this bill would finalize the shift towards a europeanstyle patent system through changing from a firsttoinvent to firsttofile system establishing a new set of prior use rights and adopting a third europeanstyle postgrant challenge this bill would prompt a litigation boom primarily inside the administrative review processes at the unitedstates patent and trademark office in europe five percent of patents are challenged in the united states only 1 5 percent of patents are challenged in court contrary to the misinformation from the other side of this debate that there is a litigation boom in patent cases japan dropped postgrant review in 2004 because it consumed 20 percent of their patent office resources canada saw a onethird increase in patent applications and clogged up its system when it shifted to firsttofile commenting on similar legislation in 2007 a former senior judge and deputy director of the ip division of the beijing high peoples court said the bill will weaken the right of patentees greatly increase their burden and reduce the remedies for infringement the bill favors infringers and burdens patentees it is not bad news for developing countries which have lower technological development and relatively fewer patents that is why entrepreneurial organizations such as the national small business association nsba and the angel venture forum oppose h r 1249 second i believe the bill is unconstitutional on several grounds first h r 1249 shifts from a firsttoinvent system to firsttofile however article 1 section 8 states that the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive rights to their respective discoveries the first congress included 23 of the 55 delegates to the constitutional convention three other delegates served in the executive branch including president george washington when examining the 1790 patent act we know the intent of the founding fathers in patent lawthe legislation clearly states that the patent goes to the first and true inventor this was recently reaffirmed in a june 6 2011 supreme court decision written by chief justice john roberts in stanford v roche in which he said that s ince 1790 the patent law has operated on the premise that rights in an invention belong to the inventor although much in intellectual property has changed in the 220 years since the first patent act the basic idea that inventors have the right to patent their inventions has not in addition two constitutional scholars specializing in patent law ranging the political spectrum agree that moving to a first to file system is unconstitutional jonathan massey former law clerk to supreme court justice william brennan and who represented former vice president al gore in bush v gore said our nations founders understood that technological progress depends on securing patent rights to genuine inventors to enable them to profit from their talents investment and effort if the bills provisions had been law in the 20th century the wright brothers would have been denied a patent for the airplane adam mossoff professor of law at george mason university and chairman of the intellectual property committee of the conservative federalist society said in shifting from a firsttoinvent to a firsttofile system the america invents act contradicts both the text and the historical understanding of the copyright and patent clause in the constitution but more importantly of the only nine peerreviewed law journal articles on the subject of patent reform all have concluded that adopting a firsttofile system is unconstitutional so if this bill becomes law it will be tied up in litigation further delaying innovation until the supreme court rules on its constitutionality section 18 of h r 1249 also creates a special class of patents in the financial services sector subject to their own distinctive postgrant administrative review and would apply retroactively to already existing patents governmental abrogation of patent rights represents a taking of property and therefore triggers fifth amendment obligations to pay just compensation section 18 would shift the cost of patent infringement from financial services firms to the unitedstates treasury finally the prior use provision in h r 1249 violates the exclusive use provision guaranteed to inventors under the constitution thus because this bill will hurt jobs and is unconstitutional i urge my colleagues to oppose the bill the managers amendment does not fix any of the problems with the bill in fact it further compounds the problems with the bill the first step to fixing our patent system is to fix the pto this managers amendment would still allow patent fee diversion to take despite promises made in recent days permitting the pto to retain its fees will allow the agency to hire more examiners and modernize its information technology infrastructure to reduce the massive backlog of pending patent applications

metaanalysis comprised of 22 studies and over 887 000 participants the largest quantitative estimate of mental health risk associated with abortion in world literature ever revealed that women who have undergone an abortion experience an 81 percent increased risk of mental health problems you never hear that from the abortion side the times of london has also found the clear link that women had twice the level of psychological problems and three times the level of depression and subsequent risk to children born to women who have had a previous abortion this is all about no taxpayer funding for abortion nothing less than a comprehensive prohibition on public funding promotion and facilitation of elective abortion in any federal health program satisfies the demands of social justice the protect life act authored by chairman joe pis and dan lipinski ensures that all the elements of the hyde amendment applies to all the programs that are both authorized and appropriated in obamacare by now i trust that all members fully understand that because programs in obamacare are both authorized and appropriated in the law the actual hyde amendment has no legal affect whatsoever hyde only affects labor hhs programs not this massive expansion of government funded health care thus obamacare when phased in fully in 2014 will open up the floodgates of public funding for abortion in a myriad of programs resulting in more dead babies and wounded moms than would otherwise have been the case because abortion methods dismember decapitate crush poison starve to death and induce premature labor prolife members of congress and according to every reputable poll significant majorities of americans want no complicity whatsoever in this evil obamacare forces us to be complicit

patientfar too many people dismiss the baby in the womb as persona non grata i respectfully but firmly asked how violence against children by abortiondismemberment chemical poisoning lethal pills euphemistically marketed as medical abortioncan be construed as benign or compassionate or caring the dangerous myth of safe abortion must be exposed socalled safe abortion is the ultimate oxymoron an orwellian manipulation of language designed to convey bogus respectability to a lethal act abortion is never safe for the child and is antithetical to un development goal 4which rallies the world to reduce child mortality abortion is by any reasonable definition child mortality it sole purpose is to kill a baby arrogant and presumptuous talk that brands any child as an unwanted child reduces that child to a mere object bereft of inherent dignity or value abortion not only dismembers and chemically poisons unborn children to death but hurts womens health and puts future children subsequently

women who had undergone an abortion experienced an 81 increased risk of mental health problems recently the times of london reported that women who have had abortions have twice the level of psychological problems and three times the level of depression as women who have given birth or who have never been pregnant similarly the risk of subsequent children being born with low birth weight increases by 35 percent after one and 72 percent after two or more abortions another study shows the risk increases 9 times after a woman has had three abortions what does this mean for her children preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in the industrialized world after congenital anomalies preterm infants have a greater risk of suffering from chronic lung disease sensory deficits cerebral palsy cognitive impairments and behavior problems low birth weight is similarly associated with neonatal mortality and morbidity obamacare authorizes health care plans and policies funded with tax credits to pay for abortion so long as the issuer of the federally subsided plan collects a new congressionally mandated fee from every enrollee in that plan to pay for other peoples abortions requiring the segregation of funds into allocation accountsa mere bookkeeping exercise touted by some as an improvement to the new proabortion funding schemedoes absolutely nothing to protect any victimsbaby or motherfrom publically funded abortion also billions for new community health centers are outside the scope of the hyde amendment as well obamacare also contains a little known provision that creates a devastating loophole for conscience rights section 1303 d allows any state or federal law involving emergency services to override any conscience protections added to ppaca contrary to the claims of h r 358 opponents section 1303 d is not uniquely about the 1986 emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala the section references emtala but the operative language is much broader giving authority to override conscience laws to any federal or state law that employs the term emergency services the nondiscrimination on abortion new subsection 1303 g portion of h r 358 the protect life act applies to obamacare the language of the hyde weldon amendment which has been in the annual labor hhs appropriations bills every year since 2004 without any effort to change or remove it this subsection is needed because obamacare creates many new funding streams that bypass the labor hhs appropriations act and therefore bypass the protections of the hyde weldon amendment in that act also obamacare creates a huge new program administered by opm that would manage two or more new multistate or national health plans the new law stipulates that at least one plan not pay for abortion which only begs to question what about the other new multistate plans administered by opm why can those federally administered plans include funding abortion on demand this represents a radical departure from current policy additionally other appropriated funds under obamacare that have no hydetype protections include billions for a temporary high risk health

july 2010 which produced a public outcry after which dhhs announced a discretionary decision that the pcip plans would not cover elective abortions commentators on all sides of the issue were in agreement about one thing coverage of elective abortions within this new 100 federally funded program was not impeded by any provision of the ppaca and was not even addressed in executive order 13535

2009 study by the pew hispanic center 7 8 million illegal aliens hold jobs in america there is a surefire way to create jobs now for american citizens evict all illegal aliens from america and immediately open up millions of jobs for unemployed americans the eviction of illegal aliens from america has the side benefit of eliminating the abundance of cheap illegal alien labor which in turn forces blue color wages up thus helping american families afford and pursue the american dream unfortunately there are those in washington who chase a different dream a class warfare nightmare that pits unemployed americans against illegal aliens in a competition for scarce jobs the white house and too many members of congress seek amnesty for millions of illegal aliens thereby legitimizing criminal conduct and depriving american citizens of job opportunities congress and the white house must create jobs now for american citizens we can and must fight for american citizens not turn our heads the other way which gives illegal aliens preference over american citizens but the issue of illegal aliens is greater than just jobs and better incomes for american citizens illegal aliens crowd our hospital emergency rooms delaying treatment for americans and driving up health care costs because too many illegal aliens dont pay their bills too often illegal aliens get free health care on the backs of our already stressed american taxpayers illegal aliens also do not produce enough in tax revenue to pay for our schools yet illegal alien children overcrowd our schools thereby reducing the quality of education for american children illegal aliens commit horrendous crimes against american citizens crimes that strain state and federal judicial systems police and sheriff departments and prisons that are already overcrowded and in a financial crisis supreme court justice sandra day oconnor in one of her last supreme court opinions wrote in 2005 in medellin v drake that in 2003 over 56 000 noncitizens were held in state prisons noncitizens accounted for over 10 percent of the prison populations in california new york and arizona as of february 2005 119 noncitizens from 31 nations were on state death row so that i am clear let me emphasize that death row is not just for any kind of murderer death row is for murders where victims are tortured or raped before killed death row is for murders where multiple citizens are killed in sum death row is reserved for only the most heinous of murderers hundreds if not thousands of americans are dead today because the united states government has been derelict in its duty to protect american citizens from illegal aliens for example in my home of madison county alabama population roughly 300 000 people we have had more american citizens killed or murdered by illegal aliens than we have had lost in combat in iraq and afghanistan combined let me share with you a personal story that happens to have happened in huntsville alabama but the truth be told similar events have likely happened throughout america on april 17 2009 a 19yearold man in my hometown of huntsville by the name of tad mattle was needlessly killed by an illegal alien who has since been convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison at a cost to alabama taxpayers well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars so that we are clear about the illegal aliens conduct he was drunk he was wanted for crimes in several states when he murdered tad mattle he was fleeing the scene of yet another crime what had tad mattle done wrong absolutely nothing tad mattle was driving home from a church social with his girlfriend he was lawfully stopped at an intersection not far from my own home after everything was said and done at the end of an illegal alien crime spree both tad mattle and his girlfriend were subject to force trauma and burned beyond recognition both died why did this needless crime occur why were these two young persons lives snuffed out because our american government has steadfastly failed and refused to protect american citizens from illegal aliens please let me share with you information about tad mattle told in the words of his grieving father dan mattle tad mattle was the first child of dan and terri mattle born on november 8 1989 in florissant missouri tad was very curious and enjoyed figuring out how things worked shortly after his parents installed safety locks on all of the cupboards he figured them out and then taught his little brother how to defeat them he loved to play outside in the dirt and loved the water he enjoyed trying different sports more than anything however he loved building and creating to the frustration of his parents he would scatter legos all over the floor as he created ships starships and airplanes on family vacations he reveled in the sand as he built sand castles when he was 8 years old he helped his father rebuild an engine on the family truck at age 9 tad mattle and his family moved back to huntsville alabama being very social he quickly made new friends at church and school in cub scouts he achieved the arrow of light award in his last year he won the pack pinewood derby contest in middle school tad joined the boy scouts and joined the school band as a percussionist tad thoroughly enjoyed making music and he kept switching between first and second chair with one of his friends during a scout trip in this period tad went caving with his father by the time he was 13 he was a qualified vertical caver by age 14 he had achieved a prestigious award among the caving community by completing his vertical 8 in high school tad mattle became heavily involved in the marching and symphonic bands in his last 2 years he served as the percussion section leader tad also pursued an advanced diploma by taking advanced placement science and math classes in addition to these activities he continued serving the community through boy scout and church youth group service projects with his troop in which he served as a leader he participated in many different activities on a boy scout troop hike on the appalachian trail tad helped maintain morale with his goofy sense of humor tad is especially remembered for his julie andrews impersonation as he skipped down a meadow on siler bald wearing a 40pound backpack while the troop sang the sound of music tad was very excited when he became old enough to drive he wanted his own car so he took a job to earn money for it he bought a neglected toyota supra that cost only 475 he spent the next few months restoring it to running condition in his junior year of high school tad took an auto body collision repair course and completely restored the body of that car he was so proud on the day he brought it home from the paint booth he took meticulous care of that car and never abused it because he did not want to destroy all of his hard work during his senior year of high school tad achieved the rank of eagle scout for his eagle leadership service project he chose to rebuild a boat dock at the madison county boat harbor on the tennessee river the original dock was a hazard to users due to warped splintered and rotten boards tads leadership resulted in 190 manhours of volunteer labor that saved the county thousands of dollars in 2008 tad graduated from high school with an advanced diploma his dream was to work in an auto body collision repair and open his own shop as he worked the following summer and winter he realized that an education would be necessary to fulfill his dream tad applied to the university of alabama in huntsville and with his excellent top 1 percent act score of 32 he was quickly accepted on april 14 2009 just 3 days before his murder tad received a letter awarding him the uah presidential full scholarship which covered all tuition for his mechanical engineering degree tad was so excited as he read this letter to his parents that night three days later on april 17 his fathers birthday tad attended a church social with his family and girlfriend after the social he and his girlfriend headed to her cousins house to watch a movie while stopped at a traffic light tads car was rammed by a truck driven by a drunk illegal immigrant who was fleeing from the police tad and his girlfriend were killed instantly which was a blessing because the impact ruptured the gas tank of the car tad had so meticulously restored and burned the two beyond recognition there were no skid marks from the drunken drivers vehicle and accident investigations indicated the truck impacted between 67 and 72 miles per hour almost double the legal speed limit the illegal immigrant responsible for this crash had seven different aliases had four different dui arrests and was wanted by at least four other states for misdemeanors and felonies according to police records he was to have been deported in 2001 let me reread that part for emphasis the illegal immigrant responsible for this crash had seven different aliases had four prior dui arrests and was wanted by at least four other states for misdemeanors and felonies according to police records he was to have been deported in 2001 tad left behind a family that still mourns his loss his brother and sister have dealt with depression nightmares and guilt his mother still deals with days of depression this loss was completely unnecessary but occurred because of a failure by the federal government to perform its duty to protect legal citizens rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as tads father all i ask is that the government perform its constitutional obligations to its citizens to prevent other families from experiencing this same nightmare tad mattles tragic story is one of many that i could tell here today and his story illustrates so clearly why the federal government must stop being derelict in its duty to ensure the safety and security of american citizens there are many tad mattles in america each and every one of them victims of crimes that could have been prevented in that vein i introduced the jobs for americans act it empowers state and local governments to help the federal government by passing laws that identify illegal aliens deter illegal aliens from entering the united states apprehend illegal aliens or encourage or otherwise cause illegal aliens to leave the united states states arent asking for another federal handout theyre asking for freedom from federal interference theyre asking for the freedom to protect their citizens lives and livelihoods this act ensures that the federal government will appreciate not punish states that do the hard work of enforcing our laws when states like arizona alabama georgia and many others act to stop illegal aliens they should be given letters of appreciation from washington leaders for doing washingtons job instead they receive lawsuits from the presidents justice department that is wrong and the justice departments conduct will only victimize more american citizens my jobs for americans act prevents these wasteful justice department lawsuits against states that are only trying to protect their citizens from illegal aliens and the federal governments dereliction of its duties today i ask my colleagues to join me in supporting american jobs the jobs for

freedoms than any nation has ever enjoyed in the history of the world are right here in this country we have been blessed so richly and lest we begin to think weve been blessed because of something that we did to deserve to be born in america for all those wonderful people who have immigrated to america we didnt deserve to be born here or immigrate here so why did we end up being in the country with the greatest freedoms in the history of the world since it wasnt because of something we did to deserve to be here the answer is very clear weve been blessed as a nation because of the actions of those who went before us for those who believe in the bible its full of one incident after another historically where it was shown that generations ended up being blessed because of the faithfulness of one generation one of the things that was difficult for me to come to grips with as a judge is how often children pay for the sins of the parents and thats bringing me to where we are today we are a nation that has done the unthinkable a nation that has brought in around 2 1 trillion for the last couple of years and yet has spent 3 6 3 5 3 6 trillion how irresponsible could that be and the problem is future generations will have to pay and pay and pay for the selfindulgence the arrogance and the selfcenteredness of this generation and its heartbreaking when you step back and take a good look at whats going onl polls indicate that 70 percent or more of american adults believe that this will be the first generationmy generation will be the first in american history that does not leave the country to our children better than we found it its why im here we can do better than that but wed better hurry because if we have 2 3 4 more years of what the president proposed 1 65 trillion in deficit spending theres not going to be a country i dont care how much smarter we think we are in this country how much more intellectual some of the liberals may be here you cant outrun history there are lessons that are established and if you commit this act then in the laws of nature and history youre going to get this result if you spend too much money you dont have for long enough youre going to lose your country its happened over and over it doesnt matter how smart you are it doesnt matter how many letters you have after your name it doesnt matter if you commit certain acts youre going to get certain results just as sure as if its a scientific experiment thats been proven over and over well it has been proven if you spend too much youre going to lose the country now the germans after world war i thought perhaps they could print the money fast enough so that they could pay the massive indebtedness they had after world war i and that could get them on solid footing some remember the cartoons from history books there are people alive today that remember themselves wheelbarrows with cash being carried to buy bread that was a cartoon i saw in my history book and ultimately as the countrys economy collapsed they became so desperate that they were willing to elect a little guy with a mustache who began to blame those of jewish origin leading to the worst holocaust in the history of mankind nothing we can be proud of what led to it what opened the door for this barbarian to take over such a proud country and lead them into this unthinkable horrible crime against humanity over 6 million jewish people were killed exterminated economic problems spending too much owing too much and trying to print money to make it up didnt work so they got desperate look at the soviet union most historians give credit to president reagan because he was unflinching even when some described a defense shield as star wars as some fictional ridiculous thing that we might try to do on the other hand president reagan could see clearly that the truth was that to have a doctrine called mutual assured destruction properly called mad then that was truly mad youre going to have two countries racing to make nuclear weapons the only defense is that you both agreed youll never put up a defense so if one country launches its nukes at the other then the other will certainly launch theirs and both will be mutually assured that they will both be destroyed and thats the defense president reagan saw that as no defense it was not a proper defense and some called him a nitwit and ignorant i can identify im accused of those things on blogs every day maybe i am but i know history and the history and the truth is that by his moving forward with a way to actually defend the people of the united states with a defense shield that would stop incoming nuclear weapons then the russians had no choice they had to try to keep up they couldnt keep up financially and they went broke i learned a great deal during the summer i spent in the soviet union as an exchange student in college that was when it was truly the soviet union i saw socialized health care up close and personal i saw it i went through a medical school i went through hospitals i went through clinics and i needed some help at one point but i knew one thing i sure didnt want to ever go to socialized medicine that was for sure because the doctors i was surprised to find out really werent respected over there unless it was some national doctor nationally known otherwise these doctors were like poorly paid plumbers plumbers got a lot more respect it was a 9to5 type job theyd show up they didnt care if they hadnt seen you before theyd see you it didnt matter whether you got that well or not that was largely the case youd run into somebody that tried to do a good job every now and then from what the russian students would tell me but basically you might as well try to heal yourself and be your own physician because when you go to socialized medicine just as dr berwick has indicated before president obama put him in charge of our health care when you go to socialized medicine and you put the government in charge whether you want it or not whether you will admit it or not historically if you go to socialized medicine if you go to governmentcontrolled medicine then youre going to have rationing dr berwick made that clear its not a matter of if its a matter of when and how much so unless obamacare is repealed we will get rationed care our president told people on that side of the aisle the day they were going to vote on and pass obamacare that he had some good news if they would just vote for it then things would be different whereas in the pastand these are his wordsin the past you go to the doctor and get five tests now youll go to the doctor and get one test well for those of us that have experience i know that if my mother had been given one test they would never have found her brain tumor it took 6 days it prolonged her life for 15 years and she made invaluable contributions to mankind to east texas texas and the country during that period and was an invaluable teacher of students of children in the eighth grade one test she would have been dead six days of tests they found it well mother would have been dead i have a lady in my district who contacted me when this whole debate started and said you need to know my experience i immigrated from england my mother got cancer over there and died the sole reason my mother died of breast cancer was because she was in england and in england you have to be put on a list youre on a list to get a mammography youre on a list to be treated youre on a list to get radiation or any other kind of chemotherapy youre on a list and that is the way you deal with governmentcontrolled health care because ultimately governmentcontrolled health care does not break the bank because you ultimately unless the nation just completely goes broke they say you know what we have this much money and therefore we can only give out this many tests we can only do this many transfusions this many transplants we only have this much chemo radiation and lets see sir or maam we dont think youre productive enough and so youre not getting it we as your government overseeing your health care have to make a call somebody has got to thats where governmentcontrolled health care goes its where it has to go or it bankrupts the country but the good news is for those who worry about health care bankrupting the country we may not have to get that far unless we take responsible steps that any rightthinking group of leaders should take then we could finish out with a whimper every country meets its demise at some point no nation lasts forever and anyone who thinks so has never studied history appropriately and this nation will be no exception the only question is are we going to be a generation that takes such responsible steps and follows the rules of history many of which jesus laid out you want to be a generation that is blessed and have your children blessed here are the rules well we need to follow the rules if our children and our grandchildren are going to be blessed because the track we are on right now and all those leftwing blogs that like to take shots at us who are conservatives they will one day be looked at as such blatant fools because thats the way it goes a country toward the end of its demise the liberals who say there can be no end to this wonderful hedonistic society they are the most popular because they are playing to peoples hopes there will be no end to this society sure there will be no end it will go on forget these naysayers well im not a naysayer im a yeasayer and i would like this generation to say yea to blessing at least the next couple of generations but its in our hands but once the naysayers who are truly the naysayers who say nay nay you people who want to be respon sible spend within your means who want to provide for the common defense you guys youre crazy youre nuts ive been called nuts for pointing out the fact that we have actually had people men associated with known terrorist groups send over their wives to have children in this country then the wife comes back with a baby with an american passport and an american citizenship you can go online china provides birthright citizenship you pay a fee and we will get you an american visa come into the united states there is a muslimowned hotel in new york city and they were upset online it seemed like because people were not giving them credit for being the first group to come up with birthright citizenship you pay a big fee to this hotel in upper new york and they would put you up for a month if you are pregnant they get you a doctor to help deliver your baby one of the best in new york and they had the mechanism in place to help you get that american passport and then the most precious gift that anybody could be given a child a blessing not a terror a gift of a child is born with an american passport and it is taken back and in some cases i hope and pray it is not many but i know it is happening they are taken back and until they are adult they are trained to hate americans and that the greatest thing they could ever do for eternity is help destroy the american way of life they look at our way of life and they see rape and crimes occurring in america and they say see that is what happens when you dont have a totalitarian religious sharia law existing where we tell everybody what they can and cant do we dont allow that kind of freedom because it leads to debauchery i happen to think that god gave us that much freedom and the freedom to choose and unfortunately some choose wrong eventually every country has too many who choose wrong and thats when they lose their country so it made sense if youre interested in providing for the common defense that we would take a look at those who are trying to destroy us and by the way the state department is not going to take a look at that i made an official inquiry of the state department my office did and asked tell us how many times women have come into this country and had babies when their husband was known to be on the terrorist watch list or associated with a terrorist group the state department came back and told us we cant tell you because we dont check the husbands name is on any womans application for a visa but we dont inquire if there is going to be hospitalization you wouldnt want it to be specific as to one gender but you could inquire and to help keep immigrants from bankrupting our country it would seem like the state department would inquire are you anticipating hospitalization when you come into this country and of course i have a bill on health care that says any immigrant in order to get a visa is going to have to show that they have already purchased health insurance for any health care they will need in the united states we are willing to let people in we let in more people on visas than any nation in the world we are willing to let you in but youve got to pay for your health care while youre here well we dont do that one lady had said the great thing about my daughter coming in and having a babyand yes her husband was a member of a terrorist group in the middle east on our terrorist watch listbut the good news is she doesnt even have to pay for anything she can leave with an american passport and she doesnt have to pay for anything the americans pay for it we have to stop that its nuts the state department doesnt inquire if you anticipate hospitalization and even though the spouses name is on the visa application they say as a rule we dont bother to check to see if the spouse is a terrorist you have groups out here who are condemning justices on the supreme court because their spouse may be politically active they show themselves to be blatantly extremely partisan like common cause because they have never raised that issue with a former leader of the aclu whose husband late husband apparently a fine man but he did have political interests and they were affected by decisions of the court and those groups never complained about that but they only come after conservatives on the court like justice scalia justice thomas who believe that the words on the page of the constitution the pages mean what they say they dont change over time otherwise you can have no consistency as a nation so it would only make sense that somebody up here in congress who has taken an oath to provide for the common defense would say you know weve noticed that every one of these terrorists in the lastwell since 1991 who have really wanted to do anything to destroy our way of life as a whole that they seem to have a connection that they are not muslim they are radical muslims they are radical islamic jihadists so wouldnt it make sense to take a look we know the largest percentage of muslims in america are peaceloving they dont believe that jihad means you go kill your neighbor they believe its an internal jihad where you change your life and leave the old behind but there are disagreements over what percentage of muslims are these radical islamic jihadists who want to destroy our way of life wouldnt it make sense that wed make inquiry into that it sure seems to me that we should yet pete king the chairman of the appropriate committee wanted to do just that and he has been under death threats ever since it first came up now for some of us we say gee in order to keep my commitment to my oath to provide a defense for this country i think we need to look at this issue of radical islam when you have a major hasan at fort hood who kills american soldiers in their place of refuge while yelling allah akbar perhaps we should look at that issue this is despite the fact that the defense department didnt even want to mention the word jihad or the word terrorist did not want to point out the fact that they had made him the imam for fort hood or the fact that he had apparently told many people if i get orders to deploy to the middle east i cannot risk spiritually having to kill a muslim for one of the reasons besides the three for which im allowed to kill another muslim one being converting to christianity i cant risk that spiritually so ill have to go on a rampage and kill people here if i get orders to deploy amazingly he got orders to deploy and he killed american soldiersbut none of that was brought up in the record its extraordinary that its not even mentioned in the report how blind do we have to be so we have one responsible committee chairman who sayswell there are plenty of responsible people here he is the committee chair with jurisdiction he is going to have a hearing and he gets blasted in death threats so to my way of thinking when someone announces you know what im going to have a hearing and were going to look into whether radical islam is violent and if the radical islamists respond by saying were going to kill you and kill your family i think they kind of help make pete kings case if he says he just wants to have a peaceful hearing and you say were going to kill you for it well that seems to me theyre making his case the peaceloving muslims are not the problem but there is an element of radical islam in this country and in this world that wants to destroy our way of life there will be books that will ultimately someday belittle those people who are accusing pete king of all kinds of improprietyracism bigotry xenophobiaall those things a lot of us are accused of because they dont know us and because they dont know our hearts someday books will point out look how silly these people were they had people saying were going to kill you and they said uhoh wed better not make them mad and try to defend ourselves and figure out how to do that lets just try to placate them history shows when you try to placate radical islamists particularly since 700800 ad youre going to not only not placate them youre going to grow more contempt because not only do they see you as an infidel but they see you as a stupid infidel who is trying to pay off the people who want to kill them so we know that in the hearing our friend across the aisle mr ellison testified he brought up the case of mohammed salman hamdaniand my apologies if i mispronounce thatwho was a pakistaniborn muslim american as mr ellison pointed out hamdani rushed to lower manhattan on the morning of september 11 2001 to assist in rescue efforts and died in the collapse at the world trade center mr ellison was thinkingand im sure absolutely there was no intent to mislead and that he actually believed what he was saying but he said after the tragedy some people tried to smear his character solely because of his islamic faith they spread false rumors and speculated he was in league with the attackers all because he was muslim so im proud to be able to point this out and i hope that its a comfort to my friend mr ellison but in fact as matthew shaffer pointed out in this national review article last night he said that in fact 6 weeks after the september 11 attacks before hamdanis remains were identified congress did sign the patriot act into law with this line includedand this is in the patriot act many arab americans and muslim americans have acted heroically during the attacks on the united states including mohammed salman hamdani a 23yearold new yorker of pakistani descent who is believed to have gone to the world trade center to offer rescue assistance and is now missing the article goes on it reads that is hamdani was actually singled out for particular high honors among the thousands of victims of the september 11 attacks there is little evidence if any of the rumors that he did otherwise you can go to google and search for mohammed salman hamdanis name using various time frames from before todays hearings that was yesterday youll discover two discordant sets of returns none for sites and news reports accusing hamdani of being a terrorist and many thousands of pages honoring him as a hero while claiming that he was widely accused of being a terrorist they cant find the allegation of his being a terrorist only those saying he was widely accused and what a hero he was web pages that do source that claim that hamdani was widely accused of being a terrorist typically trace back to a single report from the new york post dated october 12 2001 and titled missingor hiding mystery of nypd cadet from pakistan the piece has been taken offline but its content is preserved elsewhere his family distributed missing person flyers in the fear that the 23yearold who is trained as an emt went instead to the world trade center to help and was killed but investigators for the fbi and nypd have since questioned the family about which internet chat rooms he visited and if he was political hamdani a graduate of queens college with a biochemistry degree had been in the nypd cadet program for 3 years he became inactive because he needed to work full time his mother said police sources said he hadnt been to work at the nypd since april but he still carried official identification one source told the post that tells me theyre not looking for this guy at the bottom of the rubble the thing that bothers me is if he is up to some tricks he can walk past anybody using the i d card hamdanis mother who has been in the united states for two decades denied her son was political or a religious fundamentalist cops at the midtown tunnel reported spotting someone who looked like hamdani yesterday morning so the post reported 1 that hamdanis family believed he died in the world trade center attacks 2 that the fbi asked hamdanis mother a few background questions after a mistaken sighting and 3 that an unnamed source felt such questioning implied guilt no doubt that was hard on the grieving mother but frankly thisa mistaken sighting and very preliminary investigations of many people most of whom turn out to be innocentis the kind of thing that inevitably happens after a major terrorist attack so the article points out that mr hamdani has been singled out by this congress and by people in new york for being the hero that he apparently was there is no allegation by this congress of which im aware of blanket smearing saying that all muslims are evil theyre not the disagreement is over what percentage is it 1 percent or 10 percent that is being radicalized and wants to destroy our way of life its a question worth looking into because there were actual witnesses at the hearing that pointed out that their young children had been takeni say young a teenager to me is young these daysand had been turned against the united states through a mosque taken to a foreign country and radicalized to finish the process why wouldnt we want to look into that it only makes sense because if you bury your head in the sand even though you dont see any danger your rear end is hanging out there to some pretty significant danger and we shouldnt be in that posture as a country now we also know that the muslim brotherhood has been active in foreign countries weve seen what happened in tunisia egypt libya other countries around the middle east but i would humbly submit that the thing that ought to scare americans the most about our stature in the world about the way our allies and friends look at this nation and about how they perceive whether or not we will be able toand willhelp in a crisis came when we saw that king abdullah king of jordan had made an appointment to apparently work out some kind of deal with a madman named ahmadinejad abdullah ive met him before hes a brilliant man weve visited a couple of times hes a brilliant man he has a different world view but this country in the past has appreciated his ability to keep order and keep peace in his country when an ally like king abdullah makes an appointment with a madmanpossibly to cut his own deal for protectionit ought to send off alarms all over this nation that were in trouble the world perceives us as weak our friends have seen we dont stand with our friends well snub israel well leave them hanging until the last second on whether or not well even veto a resolution lebanon brings to the u n which is what this administration did well snub their prime minister when he comes early on as this administration did oh sure the administration tried to warm up to him right before the election and tried to jockey for political help back in the fall of 2010 but our allies and our enemies are not as stupid as some in this town think they see the way we treat our friends our allies those who have stood with this country through thick and thin and theyve seen the way weve turned on them they see what weve done with enemies of ours as qadhafi has been in the past as ahmadinejad has been as kim jong il in north korea has been and they say gee if we go strongly against this country the obama administration will come rush to see what they can give us to try to make us friendsobviously they wont make us friends but well take whatever theyve got to give in fact in the case of north korea and the clinton administration running over there and saying look well build you a nuclear power plant if you will just quit trying to make a nuclear weapon youll give us a nuclear power plant doesnt that have nuclear fuel yes it does we might be able to take that fuel and make a nuclear weapon sure yeah i mean its possible but if youll just promise us you wont do that well give you the nuclear material the facility well show you how to do it well sure okay yeah well give you that promise and of course we provided them what they needed to go nuclear and build nuclear weapons it makes no sense we ought to be smarter than that but we didnt learn our lesson with north korea that you cant placate a terrorist leader so this administration has talked about sanctions and weve had some sanctions against iran and i really think that theyre going to work by 2015 or 2020 but unfortunately by then iran will have nuclear weapons and they will have the ability to say you either withdraw your sanctions or were going to use the nukes that weve now sent on yachts and are outside major places you care about to blow your major cities up its a crazy way to defend the country to placate your enemies ive had this billive filed it three congresses and im hoping now that were in the majority well get it passed it seems like i pick up more supporters every timecalled the u n voting accountability act it simply says that any nationyou know theyre sovereign nations they can do what they want as long as they dont come after us dont commit crimes against humanity but theyre sovereign nations so basically what it says is any nation that votes against a unitedstates position more than half the time in the u n will receive no financial assistance of any kind from the united states in the subsequent year as ive said before you dont have to pay people to hate you theyll do it for free we can save the money we need to save the money we heard that president mubarakreally a king but called president mubarakone report said he had 70 billion in a bank now theres only 7 billion where do you think he got that money weve been giving him somewhere around 2 billion a year for years we have propped up so many evil people in countries where they devastate their own people we shouldnt be giving them money for that let charitable groups go in and give aid directly to the people they do a great job of that better than the government because we as a government usually have to give it to the government and then the government uses it to go in their bank accounts and to do what they will with their people it doesnt make sense i was also a little surprised to find out how much we help lebanon because they were short on some of their weaponry and the unitedstates was of some assistance to help them rearm last year and i was trying to remember oh yes why was lebanon a little short on weaponry thats right they were killing israelisour friends and alliesback 5 years ago thats why they were short on weaponry but not to worry unitedstates to the aid well provide military weapons to our enemies to the enemies of those who are dear devoted friends like israel yeah well equip your enemies well sell jets to countries that wont recognize israel three billion dollars for a friend in kind of an oasis in the middle of a lot of hostility is a small price to pay but unfortunately when you pay billions to israels enemies 3 billion is not enough so why instead of running up the tab why dont we as a nation quit funding israels enemies quit helping their enemies quit helping to put in placeas president carter did by pulling the rug out from under the shahapparently not a nice man what he did to his peoplebut by president carter pulling the rug out from him he fell and of course president carter welcomed khomeini as a man of peace and then we shortly found he created a terrorist state like none before in history good job weve got to stop doing those kind of good jobs weve got to get back to the basics of providing for the common defense quit condemning those who are not xenophobestheyre not phobes of any kindbut they see the world through a clear window the window of history and see that if you help your enemies they will destroy you you help your friends they remain your friends and they remain vital and helpful to you in the world picture one other thing we did to israel last yeari believe it was in may i read that this administration for the first time voted with all of israels enemies to require them to disclose any and all nuclear weaponry because people in leadership in the appropriate places here in america apparently have not read the old testament they have not read history you can go back and find where hezekiah was the king and i know there are some journalists who think that jews came from poland but actually theres archaeological evidence to show that they were actually in israel 3 000 years ago and that king david was king of israel around 1000 or so b c and of course we know mohammed lived 600 or so a d so 1 600 to 1 700 years before there was a mohammed there was a king david ruling over jews in israel they have a history in the land we voted with israels enemies and the lesson from hezekiah was as you can read from the old testament isaiah was sent to hezekiah he knew what he had done pardon the texas paraphrase but he said in essence what have you done he said oh these great babylonian leaders came over and so i showed them all our treasure and i showed them our defenses and isaiah in essence said you fool because youve done this youll lose the country you dont placate your enemies and think theyre going to be your friend if you give them things you show them all your great defenses because theyll figure a way around them and you will lose your country every country meets its demise and heads to the dustbin of history at some point weve got to rein in the ridiculous deficit spending weve got to quit hurting our friends abroad and quit helping our enemies and be about the oath that we all took in this body and if we will do that if we will follow the precepts that historyand even fdr said follow the teachings in the bible people have found it a help for agesif we do those things future generations will be blessed because of us and not condemned"], [0.0007488082046620548, 0.0007488082046620548, 0, "most americans remember 1 year ago tomorrow president obama and vice president biden launched what the white house enthusiastically called the recovery summer this was supposed to be a 6weeklong push to highlight what the obama administration said would be jobs created last summer by a surge in federal stimulus spending across the country senior adviser to the president david axelrod said this summer will be the most active recovery act season yet with thousands of highly visible road bridge water and other infrastructure projects breaking ground across the country giving the american people a firsthand look at the recovery act in their own backyards and making it crystal clear what the cost would have been of doing nothing yet the only thing that is crystal clear to the majority of americans is that there is nothing to show from the democrats failed economic policies that have set our country on a road to ruin since president obama has taken office he has done absolutely nothing to promote american energy production he has done nothing to reduce the regulatory burdens on small business owners he has done nothing to fix the tax code to help job creators he has done nothing to increase competitiveness for american manufacturers and he has done nothing to pay down americas unsustainable debt burden and bring back confidence among investors and entrepreneurs by supporting longterm american economic growth and now president obama is selling the sequel to last years recovery summer sales pitch and kicking off this summer by trying to convince the american people that 28 consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent is just a bump in the road to recovery in addition a number of democrats are calling for billions more in taxpayer dollars to be spent on yet another wasteful stimulus to create jobs but americans arent buying it unemployment is nowhere near the 6 8 percent level at which the administration claimed it would be today if the stimulus was signed into law when americas promise prosperity and security for future generations are at stake this cannot be brushed off as just a bump in the road it is a mountain of constraint put in place by a litany of failed democrat policies and unfulfilled promises and whats worse is that president obama recently laughed off the fact that his stimulus projects which are costing taxpayers trillions of dollars have failed to live up to their promise to create new jobs democrats promised this would be the summer of recovery but their conflicting assessment of the economy and their doubletalk has left american families wondering is this a joke well most economists and the american people are not laughing their concern is growing and confidence in president obamas economic policies is plunging more and more every day and the idea of another stimulus bill is dead on arrival in the house in the face of the greatest economic crisis since the great depression this administration and the democrats in congress are choosing to play politics with economic recovery and continue with another round of empty rhetoric and unfulfilled promises in their desperate sales pitch again this summer house republicans are serious about creating real american jobs and were making it our mission to put americans back to work we know that what we need are commonsense policies that will create jobs in this country immediately we cannot let this administration have another frivolous shot at the wasteful spending of taxpayers hardearned dollars or be given more regulatory power or allowed to spin its way out of the catastrophic economy the democrats have created with empty phrases like recovery summer house republicans have produced a progrowth projob creation budget as well as a real plan for americas job creators both plans will put the nation on a fiscally sustainable path to restore confidence lower tax rates and allow america to remain competitive in the global economy we want to take the burden of regulation off of our job creators and produce more american energy so that americans can start receiving the paychecks that they need and deserve and we want to reduce the hostility of the federal governments regulators toward american business both small and large we cannot allow this outoftouch administration to continue with their failed experiments and silly punchlines we cannot allow washington democrats to tax and spend away the futures of our children and our grandchildren we cannot continue down the road to ruin coming from the private sector to congress i know that america can and will become prosperous beyond imagination and millions of new private sector jobs will be created if we would just get back to our founding free market principles and end big government and wasteful spending it is time we take a different road this summer we cannot continue on the misguided and irresponsible path endorsed by the other side of the aisle of higher taxes reckless spending bigger government explosive debt crippling regulation higher deficits and unacceptably high unemployment eightyone percent of americans know somebody without a job as a matter of fact if youd look at the unemployment rate that includes underemployed and unemployed almost one out of every five americans is unemployed or underemployed today under president obamas watch almost 40 000 jobs have been lost every 2 weeks president obamas socalled stimulus was signed into law 28 months ago and there are nearly 2 million fewer americans with jobs today they have had their chance to make things right last summer and it has not worked now it is our turn these are undoubtedly tough times and i want to continue the great american legacy of leaving our children better off than we ourselves are it pains me to know that only 17 percent of the mothers in this country believe that their children will be better off in the future it doesnt have to be this way there has not been a more important time in our nations history to realign our principles and policies in light of current economic reality as the son of a hardworking rancher in the texas panhandle i always reflect back to those tough decisions and sacrifices that my family made around the kitchen table we had no choice but to live within our means every day i remember these life lessons whether im balancing my family budget or making important decisions for my constituents i must represent the best in terms of taking care of our countrys fiscal health we must make tough decisions on spending on tax reform and on reducing our nations debt and we must remain committed to spurring economic growth and job creation we must do this most importantly because we owe it to our children and our grandchildren so that theyre afforded the same american promise and prosperity and security that we were when we were born about 3 months ago my wife and i had our first granddaughter we want that girl when she grows up to have the same opportunities to live the american dream that we had when we were born before i close id like to ask our american people to remember our country in their prayers during these difficult times and also to remember to pray for our military men and women who protect it daily i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0007641904521733522, 0.0007641904521733522, 0, "i think its more the reins you use in texas to pull back on that bull or that horse thats getting away its appropriate to kentucky too with our equine culture as well i appreciate the gentleman for yielding to your point when we talk about bills like the health care bill that was forced through last year that has so many new rules that are going to be propagated over time and the challenges that were facing with an increasing complexity of government all of these rules are placing a burden on the consumer and are leaving virtually no recourse for voters and no recourse for our communities the operationalized term would be unfunded mandates but i think what we really have to come down to is looking at this as costs that are being levied that affect every area of our lives the last probably five or six administrations have seen a tremendous amount of growth in the amount of regulations as you mentioned over 3 000 new rules and regulations were queued up last year this is a real concern that affects all of us if we think about education and the challenges that our schools have today with regard to no child left behind which was a wellintended bill in terms of goals of improving student performance when that law was written into enough compromising or overly general language to be thrown over the wall to the department of education the detailed implementing of regulations moved to place a massive unfunded mandate on the individuals with disabilities education act which is for disabled children or for children who fall into that category it was supposed to be funded at 40 percent of the expected level it has never gotten above 12 percent in any school district in kentucky in my congressional district those funds have to be reallocated from elsewhere and in order to comply federally we are seeing schools lay off teachers cancel pe programs and cancel other programs that are deemed nonessential for federal compliance this doesnt help our students it doesnt help those the law was intended to help when we think about the epa certainly we can talk about greenhouse gas regulation there is a case where there is a move on the part of the executive branchregardless of whether a person is democrat republican libertarian or an independent the constitution mandated that the legislature both houses of congress had power of the purse and the power to hold the executive branch accountable the executive branch was to execute the laws not make the laws when there was a democratic supermajority in the house and in the senate what we were seeing was capandtrade an energy taxation the production of energy in this country was not able to be accomplished because there were not functional majorities in either chamber for the president to sign a bill which he said in his own campaign would necessarily cause utility rates to skyrocket now we hear the announcement well were going to go ahead and do this anyway then it comes home full circle in a way that has hit almost every community in the country in one way or another and thats the issue of epa compliance with stormwater or drainage mandates again these could be well intended but we have to look at the regulations in context what they want to achieve in my own area of boone kenton and campbell counties in my first year in congressand actually id been in congress for about 2 monthsthe epa imposed a consent decree on three kentucky counties for 800 million in effect an 800 million tax on one water and sewer district for these upgrades which frankly in most cases across our communities were entirely unnecessary at a standard way beyond what reality was and one that imposed a huge huge burden on working families and on the poor this bothered me for years we looked at different ways to deal with that the congressional review act was a good attempt but the challenge that weve had with the cra is that it has only worked one time to repeal a regulation that was the clinton era ergonomics rule in that case all the stars lined up we had a house that could pass it a senate that could pass it and a president who was willing to sign the repeal of this regulation from a prior administration i want to come back to the constitutional point because here you have working families and in fact towns in my district where the compliance cost with the stormwater decree are actually more in some cases than the actual revenues of the budgets of the towns we went back and forth with different ideas and in august of 2009 a constituent of mine came into my office as we were working through different ways to look at reducing and relieving the regulatory burden on businesses on citizens lets have regulations in the context of their costs and also one with scale this gentleman said to me how come you all cant vote on these things the light bulb went on we went back to work approaching it in different ways and came up with the reins act it stands for the regulations from the executive in need of scrutiny act in the last congress it was h r 3765 we started with the simple premise of major rules that have an economic impact of 100 million or more cumulatively once the 60day comment period is over instead of being enforced upon a particular constituency as they are today with very little interaction with industry and frankly with very little heeding of industry in the comment areas or in our communitiesfor example for things like that stormwater bill for things like no child left behind for things like net neutrality for things like doing card check by regulation versus again going against the will of the peoples elected representativeswhat that would do is before enforcement force that rule back up to capitol hill under a joint resolution its constitutional it would have to pass in the house pass in the senate and then go to the presidents desk for signature and what that would do is be able to give people back in the united stateswashington d c was one time described as a 10mile by 10mile square surrounded by reality back in the world real where our taxpayers live where the jobs are created they would now have people to hold accountable the men in the house and the senate if these large rules that are imposing such significant economic burdens were imposed upon them so as we moved forward got a tremendous amount of support for that across the business community across the legal community citizens and frankly local governments have lauded this and were looking forward to moving that forward there was so much momentum that we had at the end of the last congress that this was put into the pledge to america and was reintroduced let me back up senator jim demint introduced the senate version of this intact and then in the new congress we reintroduced a slightly improved version of the legislation in the house and the identical bill was introduced by our new junior senator from kentucky rand paul with 23 additional senate cosponsors were up to 134 cosponsors in the house of this bill and have had two hearings in the judiciary committee about it where this discussion on ultimate accountability is there before i yield back in this portion the one thing i would share with you also is this is not a partisan bill the opponents of the bill have tried to say it is antiregulation or it is an attempt to go after the administration it is not that at all in the bush administration in the clinton administration in the reagan administration in the carter administrationwe can keep going on backfinding rules and regulations that were implemented outside what the original intent of the congress had been you know in the past we could work around these rules and regulations economically now things are so tight and so tough we cannot afford to burden the competitiveness of our businesses any longer when we come back ill give you some examples of that that will personalize this to an additional degree but im really glad youre holding this hour tonight to discuss the critical impact of regulations a cost thats approaching 2 trillion a year on the american economy frankly the cost of regulation is substantially more than the annual tax revenue that is collected by the

act was introduced on september 14 2011 by my friend the gentleman from north carolina mr pat mchenry and was reported by the committee on financial services by a voice vote last week the second bill

last week both pieces of legislation have been through regular order members from both sides of the aisle have had opportunities to submit perfecting ideas and those amendments have been carefully considered every amendment that was submitted to the rules committee was made in order and will be given full and fair consideration today the chairman of the rules committee the gentleman from california has once again allowed the house to work its will through an inclusive legislative process on december 10 2009 i stood on the floor and i argued then against the rule for consideration of the bill known as the doddfrank financial reform bill it should be noted that i authored two proposals amongst many republican and democratic amendments that were all shut out that day thenspeaker nancy pelosi chose to advance the doddfrank bill without any open process consideration the result of that legislation has caused great concern in financial markets not just here in the united states but it has caused financial concern around the world today the republican house is changing that course in consideration of bills from the financial services committee today we are looking at a targeted removal of outdated regulations simply to encourage market access for millions of small businesses and to encourage not only investment but also jobs in america for those who are listening to this you could consider this a jobs creation bill so i would advance this cause down the street to the white house to encourage the president to know that this is yet another in a line of jobcreating jobsaving jobsinamerica bills that the unitedstates house of representatives is once again considering and today on a bipartisan basis with every single amendment that was submitted to the rules committee through an open process on the floor of the house of representatives ready for us to move this bill and vote on that today our economy has a revenue problem the administration continues to promote policies that slow economic growth republicans believe we must create an environment that encourages investment in small business really the engine of our national job creators this underlying bill will do just that h r 2930 would remove restrictions on crowdfunding allowing companies to pool small investors so that small businesses and entrepreneurs can raise capital equity outdated sec regulations do not allow business owners in search of investments to solicit or to advertise this legislation is needed and its being presented on a bipartisan agreement basis yesterday i met with community bankers from texasscott heitkamp the president of value bank john jay the president of roscoe state bank and milton mcgee with the independent bankers of texas among others who described to me their inability to raise capital investment not due to a lack of willing investors but as a result of burdensome regulations which inhibit or do not allow this they informed me that the sec limit on individual investors restricts their ability to raise funds through community participation and local business creation i was proud to tell them and i will tell them again today i heard your story and we are here on the floor doing something about that that will be of immediate benefit and health to jobs and job creation in america today on the floor of the house of representatives in a bipartisan agreement fashion h r 2940 allows for general solicitation and advertising which would attract private investment small privately held companies will no longer be forced to have an existing relationship with potential investors however the legislation requires the sec to ensure that investors are accredited as congressman jared polis from colorado the lead today from the rules committee on behalf of the minority indicated at the rules committee meeting yesterday that crowdsourcing investment through new advertising mediums such as social media would allow for access to new pools of available capital these are exactly the kinds of ideas that are being brought today to the floor for the creation of investment dollars to help jobs in america and to make sure that we are prepared for our future our nation is in crisis we cannot wait and with an unemployment population of over 14 million people we cannot continue the failed policies of government spending which have brought us to this point investment capital for small business continues to sit on the sidelines because of the uncertainty created by burdensome regulations and outdated rules the underlying bills will foster job creation by simply allowing the private sector to participate in this endeavor the future success of our economy rests in the hands of private small business not government unleashing their potential is the sole focus of this republican majority in the unitedstates house of representatives the result is an economic environment that promotes growth and generates revenue as well as the

process and while many of us have been frustrated it does work at the end of the day it has to work it has to work because our fellow americans are suffering at this moment i have just been talking to staff members of the house appropriations committee and we have to get the resources to those people who are suffering asap as of this morning there was a grand total of 212 million in the federal emergency management agencys fund to deal with these disasters that have taken place last spring the secretary of homeland security ms napolitano testified that we needed additional resources now lets go back to last spring and realize that was before we had hurricanes it was before we had floods it was before we had tornadoes that hit the midwest think of those poor people in joplin missouri all those homes and lives that were lost and it was before we had this earthquake that as we all know damaged the washington monument right down the street from where we are its very important that we get those resources there with only 212 million as of this morning with expenditures somewhere in the neighborhood of 30plus million dollars each day it means as early as monday of next week we could end up with nothing nothing for those people who are suffering we dont want the government to shut down we want to make sure that the people who are truly in need are able to have the resources necessary but at the same time we recognize that we have a 14 5 trillion national debt we have massive deficits that are before us and we need to do everything that we can to do what people across this country are saying needs to be donewe need to create jobs we need to generate an increase in our gross domestic product growth and the measure that is going to be before us when we report out this rule will do just that the measure that we will consider is identical to the measure that we considered in the house yesterday the measure that had been reported out basically the same package that we had last week but a bipartisan request that was made by the senate majority leader mr reid and the senate minority leader mr mcconnell was that we have this provision considered as a senate amendment so that the senate would be able to move as quickly as possible to ensure that our fellow americans have the resources that are necessary and so thats why we have ended up with the same measure that we had yesterday but as you and i have discussed in the meeting that we were just in there has been a change there is a very minor change it is one single paragraph so of the continuing resolution that we had which is 1 043 trillion exactly what we had yesterday no change in full compliance with the 3day layover requirement that exists in the house rulesand i will remind my colleagues the measure thats before us was put online on monday 4 days ago so again in full compliance with time to spare to meet the 3day layover with one amendment the amendment reads as follows at the end of the matter proposed to be inserted by the house amendment before the short title insert the following section 142 effective on the date of the enactment of this act of the unobligated balances remaining available for department of energyenergy programstitle 17innovative technology loan guarantee program pursuant to title iv of division a of public law 1115 100 000 000 is rescinded that is the only change that has been made let me tell you why that change was made and i dont often read the washington post on the house floor but todays washington post has an article that explains what it is that led us to call for using the 100 million that i just mentioned as an offset i recognize as one of my colleagues in the rules committee stated earlier we know that this company known as solyndra which democrats and republicans alike recognize has been an abject failure for this energy program is one that will not get resources because they have gone bankrupt but let me just tell you what led to us focusing on this 100 million to ensure that we never again have another boondoggle like solyndra this is again todays washington post in an article entitled solyndras exemployees tell of high spending factory woes it reads as follows former employees of solyndra the shuttered solar company that exhausted half a billion dollars of taxpayer money said they saw questionable spending by management almost as soon as a federal agency approved a 535 million governmentbacked loan for the startup a new factory built with public money boasted a gleaming conference room with glass walls that with the flip of a switch turned a smoky gray to conceal the rooms occupants hastily purchased stateoftheart equipment ended up being sold for pennies on the dollar still in its plastic wrap employees said as the 344 million factory went up just down the road from the companys leased plant in fremont california workers watched as pallets of unsold solar panels stacked up in storage many wondered was the factory needed after we got the loan guarantee they were just spending money left and right said former solyndra engineer lindsey eastburn because we were doing well nobody cared because of that infusion of money it made people sloppy now we all know that our fellow americans are suffering across this country because of the tremendous very very sad disasters that we have faced over the last weeks and months and it is very important for us to recognize that every taxpayer dollar is precious especially in these times when there are people losing jobs losing their homes and losing their businesses this is a very sad and tragic example of the kind of waste that is there and that is why the one very small but important modification to the measure that is before us will be to take 100 million and use that additionally as an offset to ensure that the hardearned dollars of the american people are not wasted in the way that we have seen so i urge my colleagues to support this rule and

they fill up at the pump and im here for that same american who turns on the tv or reads the newspaper after a long day at work to see that iran is threatening to cut off our oil supply out of the middle east and to see continued inaction by this administration to discourage energy projects energy production that would lower the price of gas here at home these are americans that are scared they simply dont have the money in their pocket in their budget to pay for these high prices 60 to fill up a tank of gas 80 to fill up the tank of gas i find it increasingly more difficult to explain to my constituents from rural colorado why this government isnt advancing policies that will bring down the prices at the pump it pains me the look on peoples faces when they tell me that theyre making 10 an hour and are paying upwards of 4 for a gallon of gas what are they supposed to do stop going to work because gas is so expensive we are facing a significant crisis and its a travesty its a shame my colleagues here tonight are here to say we will not stand for it how do i go back home this weekend to explain to my constituents why gas prices have risen 1 80 per gallon since this president took office how do i explain that this administration may be willing to tap the strategic petroleum reserve which is only to be used when there is a severe energy supply disruption instead of opening up more land for exploration which brings me to my next point this administration alleges that it has opened up vast amounts of our lands for leasing in fact just a few days ago on february 23 at the university of miami i quote under my administration america is producing more oil today than at any other time in the last 8 years this is simply false a false telling of reality while it may be true that new production is occurring on private lands where the president cant involve his antienergy administration federal lands and offshore development is far below what it has been in previous years let me cite to you some very startling statistics according to an article on e d on monday just a few days ago production of natural gas on public lands and waters in fiscal year 2011 dropped 11 percent from 2010 thats a drop of 11 percent on public lands and waters in fiscal year 2011 oil production on federal lands dropped 14 percent since last year and this reduction was most significant in the gulf which declined by 17 percent since 2010 according to a wall street journal editorial from the other day drilling plans have historically been approved 73 percent of the time since the beginning of 2012 the president has only approved 23 percent approval of an offshore drilling plant typically takes about 92 days right now thats 31 days over average in 2000 just 12 years ago 32 percent of our oil was from federal lands why in 2010 that number shrank to 19 percent of total unitedstates production let me say that again in 2000 32 percent of our oil was from federal lands in 2010 that number shrank to 19 percent of total unitedstates production we arent opening up our federal lands for development and thats the reason for the significant drop the total onshore acreage leased under this administration in 2009 and 2010 is the lowest in over 20 years the president has claimed that he is opening up new offshore areas for production and more land for leases again this is false many of these lease sales were already scheduled to take place before he even took office one was even cancelled for a year by the administration and is now being reinstated his plan even closes the majority of the ocs to new energy production through the year in recent days and months we have seen the president touting an alloftheabove energy approach but his actions speak louder than his words and they do not promote an alloftheabove energy strategy this administration has blocked energy production on federal lands and decreased overall domestic energy production across the board and i want to share with you just a few of these examples tonight we are joined by the house energy action team a group of members from across the country who are dedicated to sharing with their constituents in this country the policies that we have passed in this house with bipartisan support to encourage energy production to make sure that we are increasing and encouraging natural gas development oil developments all of our natural resources in a true alloftheabove energy strategy the heat action team the house energy action team is once again sharing that strategy and contrasting ourselves with the strategy that this president has presented over the past 3 years of his administration so the president can claim all he wants to be supportive of an alloftheabove energy strategysaid it just a few months ago from this podium right behind me in the state of the union address supporting an alloftheabove energy strategybut lets actually talk lets actually talk about what the presidents policies have resulted in on oil and gas hes withdrawn oil leases from utah costing 3 000 jobs withdrew oil and gas leases from montana issued a moratorium on gulf drilling costing 12 000 jobs reinstated a ban on drilling off the entire pacific coast announced he would regulate hydraulic fracturing again the president claims to be a supporter of an alloftheabove energy policy but on coal he pulled a permit from a west virginia mine costing 250 jobs announced the merger of blm and osm which could move domestic coal one step closer to extinction in this country when it comes to nuclear energy this president has blocked uranium mining in arizona for 2 years he has personally abandoned the yucca mountain waste site jeopardizing the future of nuclear energy in this country imposed a 20year ban on uranium mining increasing our 90 percent already our 90 percent dependency on foreign sources even on renewable energy and this presidents green energy agenda this president has closed all but 2 percent of federal lands from renewable energy development hes left open only 670 000 of 30 million acres of land for solar development again the president claims he is for an alloftheabove energy strategy when in fact what we have seen is this president is actually for none of the above this charti know its impossible to readdetails the inaction of this administration in fact some very harmful actions to our energy policy where he has stopped delayed repealed energy production in this country again tonight we are going to be hearing from many members around the country to discuss how we can advance a strong energy policy one that creates american jobs with american energy building our energy security for future generations there is one great way to power our

a job it may be news to you but there are many many many working americans who do not have health insurance but they will under the affordable care act if this amendment were to pass if it were to become law immediately all of those children who can now be on their parents policy if their parents are willing would lose their health insurance with a job or without a job these young people coming out of school are idealistic and ambitious they want to follow their passions and their pursuits that is what our founders told them they could dolife liberty and pursuit of happiness these young people want a healthier life to pursue their happiness to choose a job not based on the health benefits it may or may not provide but to choose an occupation which addresses their aspirationsnot ours theirs so i just want to repeat back to our colleagues something i heard them say over and over again they said we didnt read the bill well we did but clearly you did not and i urge you to read the bill because if you did you would see that the bill puts medical decisions in the hands of patients and doctors not your favorite insurance company you would see that it brings down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors you would see that it ends the days of discrimination based on preexisting conditions and lifetime caps on the care of children and families you would see that under this bill no longer would being a woman be a preexisting medical condition as it is now as women are discriminated against in terms of price and access to insurance you would see that it offers tax credits to millions of small businesses who choose to do right by their employees and offer insurance benefits it was for all of these americans that we acted it is for them that we stand here today to oppose this amendment and if you read the bill you will see contrarycontrary to misrepresentations that were set forth by those who do the bidding of the health insurance industry in our country you would see what the bill does you would see that it is about innovation its about prevention its about a healthier america not just health care in america its about using the technologies of the future its about bringing health care closer to people where they live to lower the cost to improve the quality and to expand the access you would see that it is a bill about the future instead of the
