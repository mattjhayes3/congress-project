budget resolution for this fiscal year 2007 the blueprint that will guide the congress spending and revenue decisions for the coming year it is not easy to write a budget ever it is particularly challenging to write a budget when you have to deal with an economic recession when you have to dearwith the worst terrorist attack that has ever hit practically any nation but particularly ours on our own shores it is difficult to write one when you are at war when you have a whole new priority of homeland security that was never even considered just 10 short years ago or the largest natural disaster ever to affect the united states called hurricane katrina it is never easy to write a budget and it is particularly challenging to do that when those kinds of things hit you not just one at a time but all at one time today we are going to hear a lot about politics you know there is this new movement around the country that i think is pretty important apd that is that we need new science and math education for our kids because we are falling behind but i think we probably ought to add history to that too i love how the democrats come to the floor today and this is modern history for democrats in 2001 george w bush took office and look at the deficit we have today nothing happened in between of course there have been 6 years that have occurred and during those 6 years we had those things like an economic recession like hurricane katrina like 9 11 like a global war on terror the need to deal with homeland security and all of those priorities not only were cheerfully voted by both sides but the national debt not only went up under all of those votes but in fact the democrats proposed even more spending to drive that debt even higher and probably the most humorous conversation was the one i just heard on welfare reform how the president is the one who usheret in welfare reform president clinton this is the same president clinton who vetoed welfare reform twice and in fact had to be dragged kicking and screaming to support the republicanpassed welfare reform which was the first opportunity for us to reform entitlement spending and to deal with some huge challenges that gave us the first surpluses in history so this budget is always going to be a challenge to write but it is particularly going to be challenging if all we are going to hear on the other side is complaints and politics and not any serious proposals to deal with it is this budget going to please everyone no you have just heard quite a few complaints about how this budget is not going to please democrats and i can certainly understand why but this budget takes into account the conversations that we have heard from our constituents back home in particular and i believe this is the budget that is the right budget and the plan to keep our country moving forward with a strong growing economy with a secure homeland to provide endless opportunities both today and tomorrow for our kids and our families it is guided by what we think are our most important priorities and it is based on a clear set of principles strength spending control and reform and let me just touch on these briefly first on strength this budget will further build on our nations greatest strengths which include our nations national defense and homeland security and the robust growth of our nations economy and job markets as a result of the plans and proposals that we have passed on this floor over the last 5 years spending control this budget will continue our efforts to control spending across the board by further restraining the nonsecurity discretionary spending and building on our progress from last year to reform government achieve savings in mandatory entitlement programs in addition to those reforms we also believe that it is time for us to reform the budget process and continue the work that hss already been done this budget will begin to reform the budget process by actually dealing with emergency spending and i will come back to all of these but let me first touch on our strengths the economy as i just noted our underlying strength comes from the nations economy and in the past 4 years 5 years it really has delivered i mean we have seen some wonderful things as a result of the american people being able to spend and invest and use their own resources after adjusting for inflation our economy has grown at a robust average of better than 3 percent a year since 2003 nearly 5 million new jobs have been created in america as a result of this economy and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 8 percent which not only is historically very low but by many economists that is considered full employment even in the face of higher energy prices which we are working to deal with and the worst natural disaster on record our economy has proven remarkably resilient and strong growing creating jobs and increasing personal incomes clearly the real credit for the growth goes to the people who do the work in this country who work and save and invest and create jobs and allow our economy to continue to grow but we in congress did support their efforts by lowering their tax burdens and this budget continues that because we believe there should be no tax increases as opposed to the democrats who propose tax increases in their alternative budget and we did this because of our fundamental belief that the people back home really do make better decisions about their daily lives about their businesses about their farms about their families and communities thanr the federal government ever could make for them as a result of giving americans more control over their money we have seen more investment more jobs greater opportunittes in our country and as a further direct result of this growth from what americans have done revenue has come pouring into the federal treasury in fact last year we saw federal revenues increase by almost 15 percent in one year now i realize we have got to stop and just highlight this because if you have been listening to the rhetoric on the other side you will believe that the bane of all of our illnesses is because we have reduced taxes and that somehow tax cuts have caused this government to fall off its pedestal when in fact reducing taxes has actually brought in 15 percent more revenue growth to our federal government and it is because our economy works when you are allowing people to keep their money and invest it on their own it creates opportunities and jobs and business development and as a result of that more people pay more taxes and that brings more revenue into the government in short our economy has gone from recession just a few short years ago to a strong sustained period of growth and to ensure that that growth and strength continues to be in an upward momentum our budget does not increase taxes second is national security this budget will also continue to provide whatever is needed to support our american troops and to ensure our nations defense remains the strongest in the world we do not have asecret plan as you will find in the democratic alternative substitute that basically says we are not going to fund the war after next year it is kind of a secret plan to basically say one of two options we are either going to bring all the troops home like the gentleman from pennsylvania wants to do or we are not going to fund them so they are able to claim balance they have basically put no more money no support to our troops in the field over in iraq and afghanistan the presidefits budget not including war funding has requested an increase of 7 percent to ensure that our men and women have the opportunity to support and defend our nation and our budget will accommodate that request we will also as we have for the past two budgets place 50 billion in reserve to fund those wars in iraq and afghanistan and we know that it is going to take a commitmeht in years to come and we plan to support that commitment not claim balance and not have some secret plan that is either going to underfund it or bring them horne before their job is done but even as we provide those resources we also believe that the administration needs to get the message that we need a full accounting of how this money is being spent and what the implications are for the future particularly in the area of defense we have got to do a better job to ensure that every dollar that we invest and that we put into this critical area is hitting its intended target it makes our country safer i cannot think of any activity that deserves more diligent oversight than our national defense for homeland security we will provide whatever is needed to ensure our homeland at the border in our country in our cities in our rural areas whatever is needed the president has proposed 3 8 percent of an increase and our budget accommodates that request but just as with defense we have got to do a better job in this new department of homeland security to make sure these monies are being spent wisely and are actually working to make our nation more secure the second big principle on which we write this budget is controlling spending lets start with what we call discretionary spending with the necessary shift of our nations prioritiesto provide for these areas of after 9 11 as an example we have come to employ kind of a shorthand to effectively divide this discretionary spending into two categories let me do that for people who are watching we have security spending which involves our national defense and our homeland security and what we call nonsecurity which is everything else that is where you will find education veterans agriculture the environment et cetera so you have security and nonsecurity and as most of my colleagues will detail in this debate we increased our security appropriations funding at a truly incredible rate over the past few years to deal with the challenges that our nation has needed in regard to security but that said when we decided that our nations security was our highest priority it also meant that everything else needed work and that everything else must come after although many seem to regularly forget the federal government simply does not have an infinite supply of money nor should it so when we decide to increase spending in one area you have got to determine how to pay for it and how to reduce spending in other areas that is what budgeting is all about last year we held our nonsecurity spending to a freeze tighter than the previous years 1 3 percent growth and certainly a marked improvement over the previous 5year average of 6 3 percent this year the administration has asked for a freeze according to cbos estimate for all thenondefense nonsecurity spending in our budget we will assume that freeze is for nonsecurity spending we believe that our security must come first or none of these other programs will matter much that said it is important to note that while our budget sets an overall number it is the appropriations committee who determines how that money is allocated clearly there are high priority programs that receive and should receive increases but in order to provide those increases they have to have offsetting reductions and eliminations of other programs and we know the appropriations committee can do this and will do this last year alone they eliminated somewhere near 110 specific programs in order to ensure that we fund those programs that are higher priorities now lets get to where the real rub nual basis reform government even if ber is going to hit the road with this it is a small amount budget and where it needs to litthe i know people around here say why road are you botherhiig with 6 8 billion 0 1345 well that may be small to some of you but it is not small to the taxthis is the funding that is truly out payers who have to pay the bills of control around here this budget will continue our biggest challenge in federal to build on those savings by again rebudgeting is the problem of mandatory forming mandatory programs and esautomatic entitlement spending that tablishing this annual process is now twothirds of the budget and finally let me talk about reform twothirds of the budget needs some at which this budget is based on to some tention well we provide the attention extent we are still learning lessons while the democrats you can hear the from hurricane katrina we should crickets they do not even look at it continue to always learn the lessons there is no reform in their budget for but one of them that became i think the mandatory programs just do not very clear is that ifwe do not control worry about twothirds of the budget spending if we do not get good control we are only going to talk about one of spending it becomes very difficult third they say to manage unforeseen events that inwe need to work on reforming these evitably face us programs they are important to the one certainly could have foreseen people back home they are not always that we were going to have a hurridoing the job they need to do we need cane we have them every year we to constantly reform and weed the gar have them every year that i have been den to make sure that garden can con in congress but no one no one could tinue to grow and make sure that we have foreseen the devastation that has can eliminate the waste fraud and occurred as a result of hurricane abuse in those programs katrina and no one would have excurrently our mandatory spending is pected it to be built into anybodys growing at 5 5 percent a year that is budget we did not build it into ours faster than our economy is growing it the president did not build it into his is faster than inflation and it is cer certainly the democrats did not build tainly faster than any of our means to it into theirs in fact this year they be able to sustain it build no money into their budget for to put it another way if our budget emergencies were balanced right now today our en now wait a minute i realize this titlements would drive it right back may surprise you it was in all the painto deficit and so we have got to deal pers we had a disastet last year we with these challenges which of course had an emergency we had a hurricane are highlighted probably most dra not just a little one but a big one matically because there are 78 million why do we not at least plan for the litbaby boomers who are beginning to tle ones let us at least plan for the turn 60 this year and medical costs are disasters that we know are coming skyrocketing and there is a steady de mr ford we have the same amount cline in the number of workers for

have spoken in this special order and i especially want to commend the gentleman from new jersey for being one of the singular and most effective voices about the truth about the onited nations in the 21st century on capitol hill and i appreciate his leadership in organizing this special order today as a member of the newly organized subcommittee on oversight for the united nations i am especially grateful to have an opportunity to speak and to do so specifically as the gentleman has requested about legislation that we on the committee on international relations reported literally just hours ago when by a very close vote and what was i think an extraordinary and civil and thoughtful debat6 the committee on international relations produced u n reform with teeth the henry hyde u n reform act of 2005 we believe will come to the floor of this congress next week and it will represent in sum total the most significant effort by the people of the united states of america to reform and amend this halfcenturyold institution and that is the intention and the purpose of what when it was introduced with the authorship of the gentleman from illinois and my singular cosponsorship the hyde pence bill purposes to do the truth is that if the united nations did not exist as a forum for international deliberation we would very likely have to invent it the united nations not as a world government but as a world deliberative forum serves an important role but because of years of mismanagement mindless bureaucracy and as the gentleman has spoken with force and authority today profound corruption this institutions vitality and survival in the 21st century is at risk without fundamental reform and that is precisely what the henry hyde u n reform act brings but i say very carefully and directly this is not a bill that provides an outline for reform of the united nations with if i can speak plainly the united states providing virtually a third of the funding for this institution and then saying we think these are good ideas for reform we sure hope you do too this is u n reform with teeth in fact we use a variety of methods of leverage in the united nations reform act of 2005 but that which has caught the most notice is the potential withholding of 50 percent of unitedstates assessed dues if certifications are not made in the critical areas of reform that are described those areas include budgeting the hyde legislation urges the shifting of 18 programs from regular assessed budget authority to voluntary funded programs that will be a great deal more accountable in the process on the subject of accountability the hyde legislation mandates the creation of an independent oversight board with broad investigative authority through the office of internal oversight services what will come to be known as the oios will have the authority to initiate investigations into mismanagement and wrongdoing and establish procedures to protect u n employees or contractors who serve in a whistleblowing capacity in the area of human rights the u n reform act also has a gettough policy mandating that the united nations adopt criteria for membership on any human rights policy within the institution under these criteria countries that fail to uphold the universal declaration of human rights would be ineligible for membership now this may come as a shock to any that are looking in today but that is not required today there are countries who participate in human rights forums in the united nations that do not uphold the universal declaration of human rights we say that should not be the case and in the area of peacekeeping where there have been such extraordinary scandals of late children little girls 10 11 and 12 years of age being sexually molested by bluehelmeted u n peacekeepers which photographs record being made of the molestation and then the trafficking of those records there are fundamental reforms in the hyde legislation that would mandate a single and enforceable uniform code of conduct for all personnel serving in peacekeeping missions and there is a strict mandate that the criteria of the commission on peacekeeping reform that was adopted by the united nations that the five criteria and objectives be implemented in the immediate before any additional peacekeeping operations can be authorized by the president of the united states i want to yield back to the gentleman from new jersey because there will be ample time on the floor next week i believe when the u n reform act comes to this floorj to unpack it for the american people but it is in a very real sense an opportunity to take that information that the gentleman from new jersey is leading on to the floor today and who has been such a champion of taking the truth about the u n and saying here is the proper response of the american people as i close let me say that one response could simply be the american people through their elected representatives could profoundly reduce our participation financially in the united nations and it is important to say that the u n reform act keeps funding level there is no reduction in funding by the people of the united states of america to the united nations in the u n reform act there is a potential for as much as a 50 percent reduction in assessed dues if the united nations through its membership and internal organs does not fundamentally adopt and implement reform in the next 2 to 3 years it is u n reform with teeth and for all of the reasons that the gentleman from new jersey effectively brings to the floor today the henry hyde u n reform act of 2005 is an idea whose time has come i yield back with gratitude to the gentleman from new jersey"], [0.007333184126764536, 0.007333184126764536, 0,

setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2008 through 2011 as a member of both the rules committee and the budget committee i am pleased to bring this resolution to the floor for consideration this rule provides for4 hours of general debate with 3 hours equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the budget committee and 1 hour on the subject of economic goals and policies again equally divided and controlled by representative saxton of new jersey and representative maloney of new york or their designees the rule waives all points of order against consideration of the concurrent resolution and it provides that after general debate the committee of the whole shall rise without motion and no further consideration of the bill shall be in order except by subsequent order of the house this rule allows the house to begin consideration of the congressional budget the budget is an important tool of the congress allowing us to establish our priorities for the coming year i am proud that this budget responds to the nations complex challenges with the straightforward principles of strength spending control and a continued commitment to reform the budget resolution continues policies that have helped to reestablish a strong united states economy we have included savings for working americans to the tune of 228 billion we extend the 2001 and 2003 tax reforms preventing what would otherwise be an automatic tax increase from their scheduled expiration the budget also assumes the extension of other expiring tax provisions including the alternative minimum tax relief a housepassed pension bill and other important economic growth measures while working to give americans back some of their hardearned dollars and letting them keep more of their hardearned dollars we are also working to enact a responsible spending plan that exercises control and restraint i am proud that once again this house has delivered a budget that practices conscientious spending our goal is to stem the ever expanding outflow of federal dollars house concurrent resolution 376 has an overall discretionary spending level that is equal to the presidents budget request of 873 billion it allows for the presidents requested 7 percent increase in defense and a 3 8 percent increase for homeland security as always the discretion lies with the house appropriations committee to determine the final allocation of these funds this budget essentially freezes nonsecurity discretionary spending with only a 0 1 percent increase over last years level a tenth of a percent as an additional savings method the budget caps advance appropriations spending that isfor the year after the budget year in the area of mandatory spending entitlement spending we provide a total of 1 5 trillion in an effort to control the automatic effusion of dollars the budget resolution calls for mandatory spending reforms from several committees these savings these mandatory spending savings total 6 75 billion over 5 years this is an important distinction this is one of the first times in the history of modern budgeting that there has been backtoback reconciliation instructions in the house budget today over half of fbderal spending is essentially on autopilot fiftyfive percent of federal expenditures today are going into what is known in budget parlance as mandatory accounts so all of the discretion that lies within this body and lies within the senate is not even half of the federal budget and within 10 years if these reconciliation instructions are not implemented that are embedded in this budget for the second year in a row then within 10 years it will consume twothirds of the federal budget twothirds of the federal budget being on autopilot if we dont implement the reforms that this budget calls for last year was the first year since 1997 that we had made the effort through passage of the budget act to get our arms around mandatory spending through reconciliation instructions this year we do that again this is an important reform effort again it is one of the few times in modern history where there has been backtoback reconciliation instructions that allows us to reduce the size of the federal deficit i am pleased that this year the budget committee included an emergency reserve fund to help congress plan for unforeseen costs that may arise in the future we have set aside 50 billion toward an expected wartime supplemental as well as 4 3 billion for unanticipated emergencies such as natural disasters and 2 3 billion for potential avian flu costs as a congressman from the great state of florida i can tell you with a great deal of certainty that the last several years have been very active in the atlantic hurricane season we know without being able to see into the future we know that somewhere in the next year there is likely to be a hurricane that will make landfall in the united states somewhere in the united states this year there will almost certainly be devastating wildfires somewhere in the united states in the coming fiscal year there will almost certainly be an earthquake or devastating tornadoes hopefully we will not have a natural disaster that reaches the catastrophic level that hurricane katrina reached but nevertheless just like responsible businesses and responsible homeowners who set aside money in their savings accounts for when the hot water heater breaks or when the car needs new tires or when the transmission goes out the federal government a little bit slowly but nevertheless has come around to the notion that we should plan for emergencies particularly those types of very expensive natural disasters that do frequently strike our shores with increased spending control tax relief and these important budget reforms this budget makes a sizable dent in our deficits under these policies the deficit will fall by more than half from 521 billion which is projected in fiscal year 2004 to 191 billion in fiscal year 2009 which is below the presidents planned budget achievements i am proud of the work of the budget committee thlis year i

committee and listening on tv to a previous speaker on iraq all three of them to the best of my knowledge have not been to iraq since the war and yet they profess to know so much about what is going on in rraq i have not quite understood why our colleague would go and meet with saddam hussein before the war and not seek to understand and meet with our people in iraq and the iraqis after the war i voted to remove iraq out of kuwait in 1991 because i believed we could not allow iraq and saddam hussein in particular to control 19 percent of the worlds oil the 10 percent that was in iraq and the 9 percent in kuwait and then threaten over 40 percent of the worlds oil in saudi arabia the arab emirate qatar and even iran so even more than 40 percent it is almost like a james bond movie that we would somehow think that we would want that to happen people say it is all about oil no it is about our being able to light a room heat a room provide power in a hospital to be able to move basically it is about our lifeblood so we went in and removed saddam and we had an agreement which he did not abide with for 12 years in fact we encircled iraq hoping i guess that he would eventually comply li 2145 we had inspections that we sought to have him comply to and he did not at the time we did not think he hada nuclear program in fact our cia did not think he had it andthen his 2 sonsinlaw went to jordan and told us exactly where we would find his nuclear program and then we were able to get hans blix and others to go to those areas and we found that he did in fact have a nuclearprogram so our faith in the cia at least mine sure was impacted significantly frankly by the failure of our people to know that in fact he had not just chemicals which he used on his own people i have been to iraq 10 times since the removal of saddam in 2003 i have spoken to kurdish families that lost loved ones they described to me how those killings took place the helicopters flying over the mists that they saw their families that collapsed in utter pain i have also seen the killing fields that existed courtesy of saddam hussein regretfully we almost gave him a playroom in which to do these things because we encircled him with a no fly zone i voted to remove saddam hussein from power in 2002 and we did that in 2003 because like president bush former president clinton senator clinton my 2 democratic senators senators dodd and lieberman i believed he had weapons of mass destruction i went to hans blix and asked him in his own country why saddam wanted us to believe he had weapons of mass destruction and he said he wanted his neighbors to fear him and he said he never believed that we would come in i thought that is kind of hard to believe but then when i thought about it it is not hard to believe he never thought we would remove him from kuwait he never thought we would do that which is a real lesson that a military power that you have as powerful as it is if your adversaries do not think you will use it becomes a power you ultimately may use whereas the threat of using it if they believe you will use it means that you can get a change in behavior but he also believed we would not attack because we learned that the oil fbr food program had enabled him basically as the dulfer report says yes he said no weapons of mass destruction but then he said that in his interviews with iraqi officials that saddam believed that he had the vote of france russia and china because of the oil for food program and because of the oil for food program he figured that the security council would not allow the united states to go in well they did not and he figured if france and russia and china would not vote for us to go in we would not go in the president kept telling saddam cooperate or we will come in my wife would say to me why i the president saying that she said i know he is going to do that i said honey he is not speaking to you he is speaking to saddam because we do not want him to go in we want him to comply now the bottom line is we went in and in april 2003 being a peace corps volunteer and someone who was not in vietnam and yet here i am of vietnam age sending other troops to iraq i thought well what could i bring to the table i realized that what i could bring is what i was trained in the peace corps to do it is to understand their culture understand how we are able to appreciate them an arab nation aiid to see how we could help them have the opportunity to decide for themselves ultimately how to rule their own country in mukasa i was there in april 2003 and i think i was the first member of congress to go into iraq in fact i know i wqs and i had conversations with a number of people but one of them was with a gentleman named mohammed abdul hassan and i said to him what do we do that makes you uncomfortable he said when you throw candy on the ground and our children pick it up as if they are chickens or dogs he said when an arab woman puts her hand to her heart a muslim woman and your soldier is offended when really she is saying thank your for honoring me but muslim women do not shake hands with men but particularly with strangers and you are offended you should not be offended she is honoring you by saying thank you but and at one point which seemed a little out of character he put his hands on my shoulders and looked at me and said you do not know us and we do not know you well i could not wait to get back home because when igo to iraq i do it for 3 reasons i want to see firsthand what is happening so i am not looking at it through the press because when you look at it through the press it is lika you look at it through a little scope it is wherever they focus attention i wanted to learn firsthand because i had learned from my concern about his having weapons of mass destruction that i wanted to know firsthand not through other sources i wanted to see for myself but i also wanted to come back home to be able to tellmy own government things that i think they needed to do one of them was very clear as soon as i came back i said to our own government we need iraqiamericans there and we need arabic speakers now t that time iraq was under the control of the military and mr bremmer and i think they were insensitive to the cultural differences i think that they did not pay attention to what the state department had said about looting about the need for arab speakers the second time i went there i went outside the umbrella of the military i want to make this point i went on my own well actually i went with some nongovernment organizations that enabled me to stay in basra meet with iraqis stay in al gut meet with folks in al gut go to hanacan sulaymania irbul speak to every day iraqis spend the night talk to them the second time i went there i started hearing why are you putting my father and my brother and my uncle out of work why are you doing that what did they do they did not know i was a member of congress they thought i was evaluating the programs provided by these nongovernment organizations and it was honest that is what i was doing i just did not tell them i also happened to be a member of congress they made such a strong case they said why cant we at least guard the hospitals that rings in my ear because we have lost 3 american soldiers in my district the first one guarding the hospital which is to acknowledge to my colleague who just spoke that we did make mistakes huge mistakes and we dug a deep hole we basieally created a void because we disbanded their army their police their border patrol and their government we put over 400 000 people out of work and in the process all of their family members became a bit angry so we are talking about nearly 2 million iraqis who were basically told by our government you have no future role in iraq and i say that and i wish the administration would acknowledge it because rather than making me more concerned about where we are today it makes me appreciate where we are today if we were up here in april 2003 and were a little ahead or a little behind we dug ourselves a huge hole by disbanding their army their police and their border patrol but when you see how far we were down you realize now that we have come a long way we the iraqi people and we the united states in the incredible dedication of our troqps we lost nearly 2 000 americans but we have had over 14 000 who have been injured and some of them quite severely the bottom line is though if you appreciate that we have come a long way from the hole we dug you do see the progress that my colleague does not seem to want to see or acknowledge which i think has been quite significant another time i went to iraq i had one of mr bremmers people pull me aside and say we do not have any resources i only have one person here me and it is all centrally controlled and we need money i need at least 50 people the marines are leaving and they did kind of the work i was doing interacting with the populace and the polls are coming in and they are not going to do it the same way we need resources i came back and said we need resources i was a little shocked to find a month later that we saw tens of billions of dollars being added a little resources was a lot more than i thought and i do feel that if i had it to do over again i would have wanted to have a clearer picture of the potential costs i still would have been very strongly an advocate of going into iraq but i would have liked to have known the costs better and that is one area when i look back and i say why did i not try to determine those better another time i went in i met with our folks who take the weapons the ieds the improvised explosive devices and theybreak them down and i went and saw a room filled with hundreds of these tiny mechanisms and the people that were there there were about 2 to 3 of them i know 2 in particular and they said we only have a handful of people we need 50 to 100 folks to help us break these down they were key chains the keys that would open the door they were the car door openers they were timers in washing machines they said if we had more people we could break down where they were made because we could identify the type of unit that is made to make these bombs and we would know where to go in iraq when i came back i frankly asked to meet with the president and had an opportunity to share my concerns with the president and other officials about the need to get people in that area which is to say that and then that happened we got those individuals and we were able to break down a lot more of these weapons i believe as i point out in other criticism before i talk about some of the amazing things that have happened i believe that if the white househad been more open to legislative oversight and we in congress had been more aggressive on legislative oversight abu ghraib never would have happened because this is what would have happened one of us would have been in abu ghraib and a soldier would have come up to us and probably use stronger language than i am going to use and he or she would have said i do not know a darn thing about overseeing prisoners i am a cook i am in artillery i do not know how to do it credit then there was the election in by the way congressman some pretty january 2005 and all of the critics said bad things are going on here by a few do not have this election it is going to people and we would have then raised be a big failure there is going to be viquestions and it would have been olence it is not going to work looked into well i was there on election day so one of the sad things from my and it was one of my most thrilling standpoint is in summary i wish that moments as a member of congress beour military had listened more to what cause i was getting affirmation that we the state department said would hap were clearly on the right track clearly pen which did the looting do not dis on the right track i was in irbil and band the army the police or the mili i met with the democratic institute tary or the government i wish that we and the national democratic institute had done oversight in a stronger way and the international republican instibut this is the amazing thing that tute that are funded to help countries has happened it is absolutely amazing all around the world understand dethose who have voted against thewar mocracy have been in strong criticism of the and in these institutes were not president so almost everything he americans they were all of the people does they are critical of and yet we had helped in different places in when they are critical of it and it turns yugoslavia and south america they out right they just kind of fade into were all there to help iraqis it was the woodwork they said do not trans thrilling to see all of this world comfer power to the iraqis in june do not munity to come to help rush them and we did and it was a but at any rate i am going and withuge success the transfer of power in ness the vote and i had a badge on june of last year every critic of the that gave me the privilege of serving president said do not do it it will be a and in irbil there was this school and failure when it succeeded they just there were three classrooms on one acted like nothing happened well a side and three classrooms on the huge thing happened we transferred other and people were going in and power registration was running pretty well i can tell my colleagues that it under saddam if you didnot register worked and it was significant because you were likely to get killed so we when i was there for one of my visits had a pretty good registration list but and i had met with the president and i what was amazing was in every one of had met with the prime minister and i those rooms the furniture was the had met with the foreign minister the same it was corrugated cardboard but foreign minister negroponte and what so firm it was like furniture was crucial about the transfer of and people were given their local power besides giving the iraqis the au their state and their federal ballot thority was we took it away from de they went behind a protected area fense to run the government mr they voted and then they came up to bremmer and let them fight the war the person who was right there with and we gave it to state department to the three ballot boxes be our liaison with a legitimate gov the person took their ballots folded eminent or at least a government that them up and put them on top of each now was in iraqi hands i will say le ballot and then took their finger and gitimate in parentheses since there was stuck it in the ink jar and i am thinknot any election ing well this is interesting you get so we went out on this press con killed i am told if you vote and yet ference and there was all this iraqi those foliks are putting their finger in press and i have to tell you i thought an ink jar this is kind of a kick i am going to and i learned from some from south have a press conference with iraqis america they use that system in the first thing i said was we made south america in some of the counsome mistakes but and there was tries if you try to erase the ink it gets nodding of heads by the iraqis because darker the only way you can take it i knew that they all agreed and knew off is to take your finger off you just that it was a mistake to disband the have to wait until the skin dies so it army the police the border patrol is there for many many many days and the government at least most of and i am watching this give the balthem felt that way lot put your finger in the ink jar and well the first question was to the i wanted to bond with the iraqis i was iraqi foreign minister so i stepped in a kurdish village and i went up i aside and he answered the question i think somewhat meekly and i said asked is there another question the would it be all right ifi stuck my finsecond was to the foreign minister i ger in that ink jar stepped aside and he answered that well the woman who was in charge this went on for 3 4 5 6 7 times and of the election there looked up at me i finally said to mr negroponte i said looked down at the inkjar looked up ambassador what better proof do we at me again looked down then looked have that the iraqis believe and with up at me again and then she said no justification that their own people are you are not an iraqi i was embarnow in charge rassed everybody looked at me i sure was 0 2200 not an iraqi and then i welled up with that was a huge huge success for this incredible emotion for two reawhich the president basically got no sons the pride that she had and i was not one of her but she was a kurd and she said i was not an iraqi she did not say i was not a kurd i saw iraqis line up to vote they were dressed up and they brought their men with them the iraqi women because they wantedto vote and i saw them carry their children just like we would do later that day i met with the president of iraq the election is in january this was to elect an assembly which would then select people for a panel for the constitution that then had to be ready by september for a vote in october and he told me he got there half an hour early and they made him wait a half an hour and then he smiled and he said is that not terrific but then he got angry and he said i was fined 1 000 for campaigning the day before the election and i said well mr president what did you do he described to me what he did and i am thinking to myself it sure sounded like campaigning to me and then he said but you know they fined everybody else too and i thought you know what this is amazing when i met with the election officials later that day i learned there were 160 000 iraqis who ran this election contrary to what my colleague said previously this was not run by americans we taught them yugoslavians taught them south americans taught them the english taught them some in the eastern european nations other eastern european nations had come to tell them about democracy they set it up and they ran it almost flawlessly frankly better than happened in some of my own urban communities in my own district there was immense pride and there should have been pride so it took them a while to get their government but they did and they were a few weeks late in getting their constitution what did the press say the press said they are failing that is what they said all of the major newspapers on tv they are failing and i am thinking to myself they have failed because they missed a deadline by a week or two they failed so i began to think let me think 1776 declaration of independence articles of confederation constitution of the united states i think that was like 13 years and then as condoleezza rice pointed out to me besides the failure of the articles of confederation in our constitution if you were black you were threefifths a person and a slave women did not have the right to vote and there were a few other things we punted on a few issues now the iraqis have given women the right to vote the iraqis have even guaranteed 25 percent of their seats in their assembly will be women that is what they have done the iraqis have said sharia law exists if you declare under shiia or sunni sharia law if you declare you are a shiia or a sunni but if you choose to be under common law then you are under common law they then have tried to draw in the sunnis who in the negotiations were allowed to participate even though they did not vote in the last election they did not vote but they were still there but the sunnis would tell us that they did not have this authority to say yes we put our stamp of approval on this because they said we were not elected like you were shiias and kurds but they agreed with so much in private as to what was done and the shiias and the kurds kept trying to say well if we do this do this and then we hear in the press that somehow this is a bad thing and then i began to think about our constitution when we had the constitution it did not include the 10 bill of rights and fortunately virginia in particular said we want the bill of rights and jefferson said we want the bill of rights we had to change our constitution 10 times in order to become these united states we had to amend what had been already agreed to and yet we are not even saying that the iraqis can do the same thing and we are saying they have to do it in 22 to 3 years when we took many manyi years and along the way had the articles of confederation so i look at the transfer of power in june of 2004 and say what a huge thing then the elections in 2005 so what about the election that just happened i kept turning to the press to see what happened and i did not hear what happened and then it dawned on me you know it must have been a success because the press was not talking about it what a horrible thing to say and have to admit but it is so true if it is a success it is not going to be talked about which is to say frankly if the press moves to alkut that is where the bombing would be not in baghdad if the press moved to basra that is where all of the bombing would be if the press moved to kadhimain that is where all of bombing would be because the bombing is not for domestic consumption it is for international consumption the iraqis are used to bombings they have 400 000 people in the killing fields they have the dead in the kurdish areas because of the chemical weapons saddam used i met a woman who for 10 years was not allowed to go out of her house i do not say out of her property out of her house because her parents were so fearful given her looks she was attractive that udai and qusay would choose her as their woman of pleasure some night saddams two sons it was a horrific place to be and now iraqis are forming their government when i asked iraqis during any number of my 10 visits what is your biggest fear their biggest fear is and it is hard to tell you how i feel when i say it but they say that you will leave us that you will have us taste what you have give us an idea give us a sense of how life could be without saddam give us a sense to have our own destiny determined by the majority that you will leave us i say to them we will not leave you now you know what i do not think we will btit when i hear the talk and i look at cnn and i look at other newscasts and i hear the blind we are in a mess in iraq and i see the transfer of power the election in january the referendum now and what i believe will be a huge participation in december i am saying i am in awe of what the iraqis have done i am in awe of what our americans have done because while we never should have disbanded the army the police the border patrol their government we did and the americans the limited number of americans had to fill in the void and pay a huge price but they also have done something else besides trying to maintain security trying to teach about democracy trying to build an economy they have trained their army their police their border patrol they are training thedr government officials six months ago i would have had to tell you honestly and i would have been honest that the police were not professionals because they were not they did not have enough training they did not have enough experience they did not have enough equipment but now we are giving them the training the equipment they have the cars the uniforms the places the weapons the training clearly and now they are getting the experience they are getting the experience the military was able in the last town that we were able to free the iraqis went in we followed the iraqis freed the town we followed the bottom line is we followed and the iraqis are now able to hold it let me get toward the conclusion here and just say to you that we may fail or we may succeed but we have a better chance we have a better chance in iraq than we had when we formed our own country dave mccullough in 1776 said we needed lots of miracles we needed the miracle to make sure the wind was blowing in the right way so george washington could leave and escape the british in new york we needed a miracle to get massachusetts and virginia to agree we did not have three parties we did not have the kurds the shiias and the sunnis we had 13 very independent states we had large states we had small states how are you going to get them all to agree are rhode island and delaware going to agree to let virginia and new york or pennsylvania govern no but we did it they do not need a miracle what they do need is a little more time what they do need is the possibility that they can have their elections that they can refine their constitution and that they can make sure their military has the capability to provide the security so when people say what is our exit strategy i say it a hundred times it is very simple and when they say we do not have an exit strategy that is simply not true we have had an exit strategy from day one it has been revised a few times but we have had an exit strategy it has been revised because we underestimated the strength of the insurgency we underestimated the consequence of disbanding their army their police and their border patrol but our strategy is so basic so simple and it does not need to be doubted our strategy is to train their police to train their border patrol to train their military so they have the capability to keep order to train their government so that they not only know about majority rule but minority rights to give them more time to experience the government to give themmore time to have their military be engaged in a fight with help from the united states will we leave we will leave probably sooner than we should 0i 2215 in my judgment senator mccain and others have been right we have been understaffed in iraq we will leave probably sooner than we should but we will not leave completely because iraqis will still need logistical support their military will not have the cooks the people who can do the transportation and all the other things that they need besides that fighting force they will not have the air power that they will need and frankly i do not think they are going to want us to leave from iraq completely when they have neighbors like syria the turks who fear the kurds the iranians that fear the kurds and are trying to wrap their arms around the shias and the saudis who do not want democracy to succeed when my colleague the previous speaker talked about how people predicted bad things i know darn well that the president of egypt predicted the election in january would not succeed he was wrong he predicted the constitution would not pass and i think he is wrong and i think it relates more to not the united states but more to the idea that sunnis are having to give up power in iraq to shias and that is of concern to many have there been other benefits from our being there i d6 not think that you would have seen qadhafi and libya do a 180 degree turn it was around the time we captured saddam hussein that qadhafi i think probably thought you know i have billions of dollars why would i want to end up like saddam hussein why in the world would i want that to happen and in syria even the israelis were saying the syrians will not leave lebanon but they left lebanon i do not think they would have left lebanon if we were not in iraq fortunately the syrians fear we might do something in syria now to some in my district they think that would be the craziest thing in the world to do something in syria no the craziest thing would befor the syrians to fear that we would not do something the craziest thing would be for us to say that we will not do something in syria the smartest thing is to keep the syrians wondering so we can have a change of behavior without using military when i met with the syrian ambassador he said we want to be your friends just tell us what we are doing wrong and we will stop and i said to the ambassador mr ambassador we will not want to tell you the things we know you are doing wrong and then just have you stop the things we know you are doing wrong we want to you stop even the things we do not know you are doing we want you to stop allowing insurgents to come into damascus who are terrorist bombers who then come into iraq to blow themselves up when my colleague said only 10 percent of the insurgency are foreigners i thought yes there are only 10 percent of them but 98 percent of them are bombers people who blow themselves up if we could get rid of that 10 percent we would get rid of 98 percent of the suicide bombers most iraqis do not have any interest in blowing themselves up so there is more i could say about iraq i am in awe of what our troops have done i am in awe of the iraqi men and women that i have met i believe that most iraqis who are involved in this government believe they are the madisons the benjamin franklins the george washingtons they believe they are helping to create a new nation that hot unlike its fledgling democracy in the united states where you could have said you know tell me a country that has been a democracy a country where there have been some states tell me a country you could have used the same argument against the united states nobody has it it is not a natural thing we in this world have kings and queens and dictators well what i found at least with the iraqis is they take to democracy they love the debate the dialogue they love to barter they love it and there are a lot of things we could criticize what they have done but i think in two and a half years they do not need a miracle but they make me feel like they are doing something that will have unbelievable significance in the long run for peace and prosperity"],

individually but for our nation and way of lifeit is imperative that we begin our discussionat the beginning and that beginning wasnt on 911 weve been under attack for at least 30 years we did not want this fightwe did not invite this fightwe did not wish to engage in this battle however once our enemy crossed over the line confirmed for us and the worldthat they were unwilling to respect international law respect individual liberty respect sovereignty of nationsand that they were willing and desirous of engaging in mortal battleno other option was left to us or the civilized world abu musab alzarqawi on january 23 2005 said we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology so this discussion today comes down to a fundamental questionwhat is the appropriate strategy and tactic to adopt to win the war on terror will we withdraw and simply defenda policy of isolation and containment or will we aggressively combat terrorismand take the battle to our enemy this war is unlike any other in historywithout a doubt our enemy has no single home it recruits and trains its army from nations around the world the only unifying element is hatehate for the westhate for democracyhate for freedom of religionhate for liberty the only message our enemy understands is force period terrorists dont negotiateterrorists dont compromiseterrorists are not interested in peace to them thats weakness thankfully weve stayed the course thankfully weve persevered in both iraq and afghanistan the greatest threat to terrorism is freedom liberty and democracy in the middle east and beyond today the terrorists are truly on the run last week unitedstates and iraqi forces eliminated a qaeda in iraqs top terroristabu musab al zarqawi this was accomplished with excellent intelligenceknowing where the bad guys were and when and this information came from iraqi civiliansthat is a very positive sign this important step demonstrates many things we will hunt down terrorists and eliminate them wherever they are hiding the shackles of decades long terrorism are being removed from the middle east iraqi security forces are stepping up to the challenge iraqi citizens want to be free of terrorists and they are not going to sit idly by success breeds success never has that been more evident than this past week while zarqawi was eliminatedfinding him brought a treasure trove of information allowing unitedstates and iraqi forces to dismantle many more pieces of al qaedas puzzle success breeds success iraq just this past week selected 3 more officialscabinet ministersto serve in its standing government success breeds success it is also important for us to recall and reiterate why we are engaged in this war it is imperative during this debate that we reexamine the conditions that required the united states to take military action in afghan istan and iraq in the aftermath of the attacks of september 11 2001

attacks we witnessed that day serve as a reminder of the dangers we face as a nation in a post9 11 world we can no longer expect oceans between us and our enemies to keep us safe policy of containment has been proven to be a dismal failure just as the battle in afghanistan was not simply to remove the taliban the battle in iraq was not simply to remove saddam hussein and his murderous regime one has to look no further than the action of our enemy to see that we are fighting those who want to bring their brand of terror and fear to our shores we must not forget those threats that have been disrupted here at home and on our allies the west coast airliner plot the heathrow airport plot and the jose padilla plot the campaign against the united states and its allies is ambitious simple and clear terrorists will stop at nothing to achieve their distorted sense of reality now we could have easily stayed out of this conflict however giving terrorists free reign would not make us any saferhistory has proven that the price would be more innocent lives lostmore bombingsand not an ounce of peace we must not be held hostage by terrorismthat is not living in liberty and freedom there

most reliable indication of its true intent for years since the early 1990s iran has persistently stated its need for nuclear weapon development its newly elected president pledged that he will

of its obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty irans actions over the past 18 years are clearly directed toward building a nuclear weapons capability the iranians have already built a pilot uranium enrichment facility and are currently completing a huge facility capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium to produce forty nuclear weapons per year iran has secretly imported 18 tons of uranium yellowcake from china and constructed a conversion facility to produce uranium hexafluoride gas for enrichment iran has also experimented with separating plutonium and are presently building a heavy water reactor further it has now been reported that iran has experimented with polonium polonium is a radioactive isotope with only one principal use to trigger a nuclear explosion further analysis by the unitedstates department of state released as of august 2005 states that the united states believes that iran has manufactured and stockpiled blister blood and choking chemical agents and weaponized some of these agents into artillery shells mortars rockets and aerial bombs in contravention to the chemical weapons convention in july iran announced that it succeeded in developing solid fuel technology for ballistic missiles which can be launched with almost no warning far more quickly and reliably and with greater accuracy than those with liquid fuel in august iran resumed converting uranium to gaseous state this isa step that precedes enrichment which then can produce nuclear material usable both as fuel in nuclear reactors and as material for an atomic bomb iran calls upon the western countries to trust iranian intentions but how could we possibly do that irans claim is that its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes onlyto produce electricity that claim is simply not credible iran has the worlds second largest proven reserves of natural gas along with huge crude oil reserves it is neither cost effective nor expedient to develop nuclear

reform proposals currently under consideration in the house and senate i would like to place into the record a listing of congressionallydirected projects in my home state of idaho that are contained within the report to this bill these are projects that i asked the agriculture subcommittee to consider both this year and in previous years and i am grateful for their inclusion in this bill id like to take just a few minutes to describe why i supported these projects and why they are valuable to the nation and its taxpayers it is important to remember that the vast majority of these funds go to two entities first the cooperative state research education and extension service csrees grants included below are targeted to our nations land grant colleges in the case of idaho these funds are used by the university of idaho to conduct research on a variety of crops important to the pacific northwest i have also supported research in washington and oregon because their research is invaluable to my constituents as well in assessing the value of these requests there are some important considerations that must be made word labor standards and costs are far below those of the unitedstates our na tions farmers are subjected to far more stringent environmental regulations than those of many of our competitors input costs in the unitedstates far surpass those of other nations and energy prices including farm diesel are rising dramatically so how can a unitedstates farmer remain competitive in a global market through greater productivity and efficierlcy increased yields and better defenses against diseases these are the very things that agriculture research funding delivers for unitedstates producersand for unitedstates consumers if you want to rely on foreign nations for our food in the way we rely on them for our oil then by all means eliminate these important agriculture research programs but if you believe as i do that maintaining a domestic capability to produce our food is a national security issue then you ought to support these research programs and fight for their continuation the second entity that receives the bulk of these funds is the agriculture research service ars and its stations across rural america in idaho these institutions are conducting vital research into some of our most important cropssugar potatoes small fruits and aquaculture i encourage all of my colleagues to visit an ars station to see firsthand the value of this research if you do you will learn that these researchers are doing amazing things with very limited budgets these projects are usually small in terms of their funding but the benefits that flow from that research cannot be measured in dollars alone two of the projects below are funded through the animal and plant health inspection service aphis these two programs are critical to combating brucellosis in bison and cattle and in assisting ranchers whose livestock are harassed and killed by predators like wolves the greater yellowstone brucellosis funding is particularly critical to my home state of idaho idaho recently lost its brucellosis free status and these lunds are critical to establishing a management plan that will allow idaho to regain its brucellosis free status the tristate predator control funding is hardly a handout to ranchers the federal government forced wolf reintroduction on idaho and other western states and it is dutybound to pay for the deadly and gruesome impacts of this decision the final project on this list is the idaho oneplan the idaho oneplan is a unique collaboration of agencies industries and associations dedicated to assisting idaho farmers and ranchers in their continuing natural resource stewardship responsibilities the program was developed jointly with state and federal resource agencies the university of idaho cooperative extension program the environmental protection agency and local commodity groups its a successful program that has enormous value to not only the idaho agriculture community and the environment but to other states that might be interested in a similar collaborative process any effort to remove these projects from the bill would not only result in zero savings to taxpayers it would stop dead these important efforts to enhance and protect our nations food supply i appreciate the opportunity to provide a list of

joining us today and really painting a wonderful picture i do not know if you heard all of the items that congresswoman foxx ticked off there but this is positive news this is great news this is good good news consumer confidence increasing incomes up across the nation average real aftertax income per person has risen 7 9 percent retail sales increased manufacturing continues to expand durable goods orders on the rise new orders for durable goods increased 1 3 percent in december with new orders for machinery rising 6 5 percent the highest level since the series began tracking that in 1992 that is good news productivity growth is strong productivity increased 2 3 percent and has grown 3 2 percent at that annual rate since the end of 2000 that is good news construction rates up alltime high again remarkable remarkably good neis and that is what the official truth squad is all about coming to the floor to give honesty to the debate truthful numbers real numbers because it is important that people have that in order to make decisions something that has been alluded to a number of times as we have had our discussion here today is the effect of tax decreases i call them fair tax decreases some people call them tax cuts i guess i call them fair tax decreases and what they will say is we cannot have any more tax cuts we cannot have any more tax decreases or even keep what we have that is what the other side says we cannot allow you to keep your money because government needs it that is the way the line goes but what is the effect of tax decreases what is the effect from an economic standpoint well again a picture paints it better than anything i could ever say down here is the year 2000 all the way to 2005 the vertical line there the vertical dotted green line is when the tax decreases the jobs and growth act went into effect and the red line is revenue coming in to the government how much money the government is receiving based upon the taxes again remember revenue going down here from 2000 to 2003 decreasing money coming into the government so what do the president and the republican congress do well they decrease taxes a fair tax decrease that is what happened here then what happens revenue increases money coming into the government increases that seems counterintuitive but that is what happens president kennedy knew that that is what happened when he had his tax decreases president reagan knew that that is what happened when he instituted his tax decreases and what happened with president bushs tax decrease same thing you would think there was a trend there you would think that in fact if you decreased taxes you would increase governmental revenue well that is the secret that is what happens and why does that happen because as we have talked about the economy flourishes the economy flourishes when you put more of the peoples money in their back pocket and in their purses and not in the governments purse what happens is that the 6conomy flourishes now i mentioned a little earlier that we in washington that government does not have a revenue problem it has enough revenue that is clear it has a spending problem so congress is trying as hard as it can to decrease the amount of spending and it is a difficult thing to do in this environment h548 co where you have the distortion and the misinforma tion and the disinformation and the incfedible personal attacks that are given soit is a difficult thing to do but all last year what we tried to do is to work on what is called a deficit reduction act wbich is spending less money ultimately it took a little over a year but in january when we came back in early february we passed the deficit reduction act that saved that saved 39 8 billion that is a good thing that is a positive thing i asked my staff to see if they could get me a poster of the number of folks on the other side of uhe aisle the democrats that supported a decrease in spending which is what they say they want to do all the time how many folks on the other side of the aisle voted for that and i have that chart here somewhere i found it i found the poster that has the name of every single democrat that voted in favor of a 39 89 billion decrease in spending there it is right there not a one not a one i point up the other charts because as i say they are truthful this is truthful this is the siate of individuals on the other side of the aisle who are interested truly in stepping up to the plate and working hard together because theseare not republican problems and they are not democrat problems but when only one party is interested in working positively it gets pretty doggone hard to do somethinghere it really does so those are the folks willing to help us on the other side in terms of decreasing spending so that is what the official truth squad is all about bringing appropriate honest truthful information to the american people and we get terribly frustrated as i mentioned with what has been described as the politics of division many people practice it here in washington it is kind of triedandtrue but again it does not get to the right answers it does not help it has been used for a long time but it is not positive it is not a productive activity and it does not serve people well back home one gentleman who knew that well was abraham lincoln abraham lincoln knew that the politics of division are destructive and he talked about it in a way that i think is more eloquent than anybody has ever said what he said was you cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong you cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer you cannot encourage the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich you cannot build character and courage by taking away mans initiative and independence and you cannot help men permanently by doing for

retirement we take this opportunity to thank henry for his outstanding contributions and influence on our country before entering the unitedstates house representative hyde served in the illinois general assembly beginning in 1966 which i note is the year that i was born so i dont quite remember that when henry first started serving the state legislature but he rose in the state legislature to the position of majority leader and he earned a reputation as an articulate debater when he was then elected to congress he brought his knowledge his skills and his passion to the house to serve our country in the house he has served on the select committee on intelligence he has chaired the committ6e on the judiciary and currently chairs the committee on international relations because of his work his tenure and his record the chicago tribune has called hyde one of the most respected members of congress and an eloquent and intellectual powerhouse now i remember back in 1983 my father had first been elected to the house i remember coming here and how thrilled i was to have the opportunity to meet henry hyde he was so well known everyone knew what an articulate man he was and how much passion he had how much knowledge he had and he was a true statesman and i really respected his position that he took inhis fight against the soviet union in the cold war that is something i really respected and because everybody no matter where they stood on any issue had so much respect for henry hyde it was a thrill back then to meet henry now i have had the privilege of serving for 2 years with henry in the house and i know i have heard through my 2 years stories from members and their experiences with henry over the years and i have talked with jim oberstar about the hyde amendment and

him now i am very happy that i had this opportunity to serve with henry he has served our nation so well he has served the state of illinois so well and i know that his legacy will certainly reflect

drug traffickers with little or no government presence in the region its inhabitants have had virtually no means to halt this invasion of drug traffickers i recently met with mr julio ibarguen governor of choc6 and he could not emphasize enough the necessity of more assistance to the afrocolombian population the afrocolombian population was already impoverished marginalized and discriminated against govemor ibarguen illustrated how the conflict worsened this already horrible situation the afrocolombian community has literally been decimated by the armed conflict and has been forcibly dispersed through colombia those who have remained in choc6 are faced with little or no access to healthcare education or law enforcement approximately 80 percent of afrocolombians live in extreme poverty in the war on drugs afrocolombians have become the forgotten victims of the conflict we must strive to ensure that their plight is not overshadowed by our efforts to eradicate drug trafficking we must insist that the unitedstates government provide more aid to afrocolombian regions american resources must be used to help alleviate the pain and suffering on the part of afrocolombians and provide them access to a better more stable livelihood members of congress should take an active role in working with their colombian counterparts and must convince the colombian government that the united states is interested in the wellbeing of colombias minority populations during this time of conflict and distress for afrocolombians the united states must be vigilant in providing support and assistance i support the burton amendment because it assists the colombian government in fighting the war on drugs we must take our commitment to fight this war and match it with a commitment to support the victim4 of the colombian conflict attention must 4e paid to afrocolombian populations so that they receive the aid they deserve we must use our resources to fight drugs and

many of our workers in this country face i am sure that many members of the military fall within this group this bill is a small step in the right direction of closing that gap other larger steps need to be taken for example democratic members of this congress are hopeful that we can work with our republican colleagues to preserve another tax benefit that may be of even greater help to many military families a provision in current law would permit military families to treat combat pay as taxable compensation for purposes of claiming the earned income tax credit this provision is set to expire at the end of this year the eitc is a refundable credit many low and middleincome taxpayers can claim when they file their federal tax returns eligible families may claim a portion of their credit ratably during the year the eitc helps to relieve the federal tax burden on many families who are working fulltime yet find themselves at or below the poverty level we had hoped that this

press for the extension of this provision before it expires also let me finish by expressing my hope and the hope of so many on my side of the aisle that this congress and the administration will meet

and commerce committee staff for bringing this bill to the floor today over the last 5 years or more many of you have heard me speak many times on this floor about the subject of autism and you will likely continue to hear me speak on this issue because i believe we truly have our work cut out for us about 20 years ago autism was considered a rare disease affecting about 1 in 10 000 children now that rate is about 1 in 166 making autism the third most common developmental disability that children face even more prevalent than things such as downs syndrome and other childhood cancers in my own home state of indiana we ex perienced a 923 percent cumulative growth rate for autism from 1992 to 2003 the annual growth rate of autism in indiana averaged 27 percent compared to an average of 7 percent for the growth rate of all disabilities this literal epidemic of autism is a looming and immediate economic crisis to our education system our health care systems our longterm housing and care system for the disabled and most especially to an everincreasing number of families across the country autism is a condition that has no known cure which means that this is a crisis that is simply not going to go away today we take a huge step forward in terms of dealing with this problem although in my opinion only a down payment on the resources that we must invest in order to defeat this terrible scourge the combating autism act commits nearly 1 billionin essence almost a doubling of funding for autismto autism research including essential research on environmental factors treatments early identification and support services this bill amounts to a long overdue and vitally needed declaration of war by the congress of the united states on autism even so while a needed step forward this is not a perfect bill because i believe we are missing a crucial opportunity to use this bill to help unravel the mystery of autism specifically while the bill before us does include language on the need to research the environmental factors which may contribute to autism it does not include a specific mandate that environmental research topics must include vaccines other biologics and their preservatives now i am not against vaccinations but i do believe as do many of my colleagues that there is a strong link between the mercury contained in a product called thimerosalcommonly used as a vaccine preservativeand children developing neurological disorders such as autism in fact my own grandson became autistic after receiving nine shots in 1 day seven of which contained thimerosal because of what happened to my grandson i took it upon myself to learn about autism and what i discovered during my research was deeply disturbing during my tenure as chairman of the government reform committee 19972002 and as chairman of the subcommittee on human rights and wellness 20032005 a number of very credible national and international scientists testified at a series of hearings that the mercury in vaccines is a contributing factor to developing neurological disorders including but not limited to modest declines in intelligence quotient iq autism and alzheimers disease and the body of evidence to support that conclusion gets larger every day yet we continue to hear repeatedly in congressional hearings in media communications and through government and scientific reports that there is no evidence that proves a connection between vaccines and autism this conclusion is not too surprising when you consider that our health agencies seem to routinely dismiss out of hand any scientific study that does conclude thimerosal is a danger experience tells us that as with any other epidemic while there may be underlying genetic susceptibilities there usually is some type of environmental trigger as well such as a virus fungus heavy metals pollutants or whatever there has never to the best of my knowledge been a purely genetic epidemic so genetics alone cannot explain how we went from 1 in 10 000 children with autism spectrum disorders 20 years ago to 1 in 166 today considering that mercury is a base element and the most toxic substance known to science outside of radioactive materials it is biologically plausible that mercury is an environmental trigger of autism recent studies indicate that more than half of pediatricians said that in the previous year they had encountered at least one family that refused all vaccines while 85 percent said theyd had a parent turn down at least one shot whether its because of fear that mercury used as a preservative in childhood vaccines causes autism or that the dangers of immunizations far outweigh their benefits or that there is a conspiracy by drug companies doctors and vaccine makers to conceal the harm the facts are clear more and more american families are fighting immunization it is imperative that we do all we can to restore the publics trust in vaccinations and the only way we are going to resolve the conflict of opinion over thimerosal is through more research unfortunately if the department of health and human services never funds or conducts the right studies and given their current track record on the subject that is very likely what will happen this question will forever remain unanswered that will be a national tragedy because often once an environmental cause is discovered immediate steps can be taken to prevent new cases and abate the epidemic in addition knowledge of the environmental cause or triggers often leads directly to more effective treatments for example this bill promotes the use of evidencebased interventions for those at higher risk for autism however so long as we ignore the potential danger of mercury many biomedical interventions such as restricted diet applied kinesiology and or chelation therapywhich many families have found to be the best treatments for their children with autismwill be excluded from the list of evidencebased treatments i stand here today not just as a concerned grandfather of an autistic child but as the voice for the hundreds of parents and families who continue to contact my office looking for help for their children they are our constituents we represent them in the peoples house and i hope we are all listening to them the debate about mercury in vaccines must be addressed investigated and resolved parents have a right to know what happened to their children regardless of where the truth lies and we have a responsibility to those children and families already suffering in the meantime we should err on the side of caution and remove thimerosal even trace amounts from all vaccinations by failing to provide a clear congressional mandate to research all of the potential environmental causes of autism spectrum disorders asd including vaccines and their preservatives i believe we are handicapping our efforts to give all asd patients the best possible quality of life and the ability to make the greatest possible contributions to society i hope that in the coming weeks months and years this congress will push for further research into the question of thimerosal and autism so that one day we will be able to say that we have done everything possible to stop and treat this epidemic in the meantime i urge my colleagues to support this very good bill"], [6.633996963500977e-05,

are not addressing the domestic crises that we face i think this bipartisan effort truly speaks to the fact that what we do and how we reach out in our collaborative work around the world issues of democracy issues dealing with tuberculosis malaria and hivaids issues of constructing and helping in ways of creating a world friendship is crucial to the domestic tranquility of america as i have worked with ambassador holbrooke who has cited the vast growing although we have made strides devastation of hivaids the impact on children the number of orphans that are facing life alone because of the loss of one or two parents there is i think no level of giving that would be too much to try and face up to this terrible devastation this accepting of the motion to instruct relates to that but i rise today to raise an additional concern and i know this bill is not addressing it as we speak but because of the difficulties that we have had with hurricane katrina and now wilma and certainly rita and the eyes of americans focused if you will on those tragedies the eyes of america focused on the tragedies in iraq and the constant bombing and the loss of 2 000 soldiers it sometimes steers our attention away from the earthquake in the south asian region impacting afghanistan to some extent india and pakistan we know there are 79 000 dead from the earthquake i would hope we would be able to lrepare a supplemental to address those questions we know there are appropriations for pakistan and the south asian region in this particular bill but not enough due to the loss of life and the complete elimination of towns and villages i have met with many from the pakistanamerican community doctors who are attempting to be of help the indian embassy that is helping as well but focused

lack of food lack of water and a lack of how the government will rebuild the infrastructure we realize it is in the kashmir area and that is a very difficult area it is a difficult area politically
