york and the gentleman from michigan for their efforts in arranging for this special order i trust that it will serve its purpose in alerting the reagan administration and indeed the nation to the seriousness of the problems this unfortunate decision has created i might say that i did everything in my power to block the original sale of the f15s to saudi arabia in 1978 i am just as determined to prevent this further enhancement of saudi arabias military capability indeed i have already introduced a resolution house concurrent resolution 90 to block this sale and i urge my colleagues to support it i have also written a letter to president reagan expressing my opposition to the sale in the strongest terms unfortunately the reagan administration now appears to be compounding its original error this past week we heard reports that the administration has tentatively decided to provide still more arms for the saudis in the form of five advanced awac surveillance planes i regard these proposals as a most dangerous foreign policy mistake on the part of president reagan and his foreign policy advisers it disturbs me deeply that they do not seem to recognize the consequences of their action in fact the state departments official justification for providing the saudis with this added weapons capability is that there is a serious deteroriation in security conditions in the middle eastpersian gulf area i ask the state department how creating a greater security imbalance in the area can help prevent deterioration in security conditions there is no question in my mind that adding to the saudis weapons capability does create a security imbalance already we here reports that israelunderstandablyis seeking additional f15s and intelligence equipment from the united states to counter the additional weapons threat from the saudis if saudi arabia gets this equipment its f15s will be able to hit any target in israel from any base in saudi arabia no wonder israel feels the need to add to its defenses why should not israel feel threatened nor would israel be alone egypt iraq and iran also are capable of coming under saudi arabian attack with this new equipment you can be certain they will all be seeking additional arms to meet this new menance in selling this military equipment to the saudis the united states is stimulating a new arms race in this most volatile part of the world that certainly contributes to a further deterioration in security mr speaker there are two other important problems involved in this proposed sale first there is no doubt in my mind that the world will regard this as another attempt to appease one of the opec oil producers saudi arabia one of the leading oil producers of the world has recently been threatening to reduce production in order to force oil prices still higher it is a tragic error to believe that welling arms to the saudis would appease their appetite for higher oil prices three years ago we were assured the sale of the f15s would persuade the saudis to moderate their oil price policies in those 3 years under saudi arabias leadership opec has more than doubled the price of crude oil causing untold world financial problems such are the rewards of appeasement second and perhaps even more im portant is the fact that if this sale is permitted it will break a most solemn commitment made by the unitedstates government in 1978 to the unitedstates congress and to israel we were assured that if the f15s were sold to the saudis no additional offensive equipment for the planes would be permitted to go to saudi arabia now the reagan administration wants to break this solemn commitment i find that deplorable and a foreign policy error of the worst kind we are united here on the floor of the house in sending a strong protest to the president i hope he will reconsider his unfortunate move but it appears at this time that it will be necessary for the congress to take action to prohibit the sale of these additional weapons i noted earlier in my remarks that i had introduced a resolution to prevent this sale in the strongest terms i call upon my colleagues to support his move we can prevent the reagan administration from committing a grievous foreign policy error we must stop the sale of additional arms to saudi arabia e"]], "top_unsure": [[1.4543533325195312e-05, 0.4999854564666748, 1, "i

a couple of points here purchase agreements are an item i suppose that may certainly force the credit market up i have to agree with my friend the gentleman from arkansas on that however the fact of the matter is that in the past during the korean war we found out that there were many items that private investment was not going to invest in or build unless they were given a purchase agreement the bill allows the president the pentagon and the department of commerce to set that purchase price should the price of the product go above and beyond that the fact is that then he has a right to sell

406 payments to air carriers providing essential air service to smalland mediumsize communities the 14 million provided for section 406 in this bill falls within the parameters of the first budget resolution and represents a 50percent reduction in this program from fiscal year 1982 and a 160percent reduction in appropriations from fiscal year 1980 continuing the 406 program will result in a higher level of airline service for 37 communities in 14 states a higher level that those communities would have received had the administration prevailed in its intention to terminate the program since the passage of the airline deregulation act in 1978 the quality and extent of air service to small and mediumsize communities has declined dramatically fares are up load factors are low route structures are thin the system as a whole lacks unity losses have mounted for western republic and continental air new england and braniff have gone bankrupt more than 15 000 employees have been furloughed at least four communities in minnesota have lost trunk service altogether this carnage in the airline industry requires that congress exercise special vigilance in maintaining essential air service to all parts of the nation under the federal aviation act of 1958 there are two programs to support airline service to small communities the 419 program was designed to pay for minimum service levels by commuter air carriers typically in aircraft of less than 20passenger capacity the 406 program which continues until january 1 1986 provides for service with larger aircraft by more established carriers it is by no means clear that federal moneys would be saved by communities being forced to switch from 406 to 419 subsidies the deregulation act requires that small points receive essential air service until october 24 1988 and that subsidy be paid under section 419 if necessary to assure such service it is very likely that commuter airlines may not be able to provide replacement service at less subsidy the administrations proposal to terminate the program could not have come at a worse time if a 406 carrier suspends service commuter replacement carriers will need additional airport slots to offer the same number of seats per community this at a time when the firing of air controllers has reduced the number of available slots nationwide if 406 were to end now there would be many more service sus pensions and disruptions than if the program continued cities that had had a good chance of keeping existing large aircraft service under normal circumstances would lose that service permanently continuation of even a modest 406 program will encourage continuation of trunk carrier air service to many small communities and provide an assist to their economies in these hardpressed times the house aviation subcommittee recognized the importance of an orderly phaseout of the 406 program when it incorporated the provisions of legislation that i had introduced into h r 5103 this legislation continues the 406 program until major trunk carriers can provide unsubsidized service to small communities or until the cab can find adequate commuter replacement service it limits the 406 subsidies to only those points than enplane less than 80 passengers a day moreover the deregulation act provides that beginning in 1983 a 406 carrier can be bumped by a 419 carrier if the latter can show it will provide better service at less subsidy in summary i commend the appropriations committee for having the wisdom to continue the 406 program and hope that the other body will accept the house provision on the 406 subsidy based on the other bodys most recent actions it appears that small communities across the nation will enjoy adequate air
