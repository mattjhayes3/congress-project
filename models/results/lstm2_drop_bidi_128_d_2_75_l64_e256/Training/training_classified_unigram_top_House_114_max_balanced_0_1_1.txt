years or so the cut that was put into law has been changed 17 times in the last 16 or so years it made cuts to healthcare providers we have caused some healthcare providers to retire early it was 716 billion that obamacare took from medicare in order to supposedly fund 30 million or so that we were told didnt have insurance now we have cost millions their health insurance policy they liked and i say we not a single republican voted for that bill it has cost americans millions of americans the doctor that they wanted to use we have seen promise after promise that was made about obamacare that was broken it absolutely wasnt true then we find out that there were advisers around the white house who were advising all along they are not going to be able to keep their insurance policy they are not going to be able to keep their doctors maybe we want to change the way that kind of thing is said it did major damageand continues to do major damageto health care so on top of that overlay we had these ongoing cuts to the healthcare providers if we didnt step in each year and temporarily pause them it would have put so many healthcare providers out of business and made it extremely difficult for americans to get the health care they need even more than it already is even more than obamacare has jeopardized so something needed to be done my friend dr mike burgess had pushed through a fix a remedy last year of 63 pages it was very well thought out he is a very bright terrific doctor a great congressman and a friend we have spent a lot of time this week talking about the fix to the cuts to reimbursement for physicians and the bill today on the good side provided a permanent fix if this becomes law if the senate passes what we did it stops the slow deletion of some healthcare providers efforts and work this provides a framework from which medicare can be reformed for the future it is valued at 175 billion and the best estimate we have gotten is that 140 billion of the 175 billion is not offset with any cuts anywhere else this would be a straight addition of 140 billion to our childrens and grandchildrens enormous debtwhat some refer to as intergenerational theft it does have henry hyde language protecting against federal funds being used for abortion i have always thought the world of henry hyde and was honored to overlap with him 2 years his work in standing for the unborn children the most innocent among us is just an extraordinary lifes work that he did i dont know that federal funds for abortions for people on medicare is as big an issue as some might think anyway the hyde language is in there it puts it in the tax code that is a big deal some of my democratic friends were not big on that there is also reauthorization for chip there are the secure rural schools our rural schools especially those in national parks have been cheated for many years from the income that they were supposed to have by giving up land they couldnt tax any more by giving up other sources of revenue from the land they agreed to allow land to be used or become national forests and they were to be reimbursed by proceeds from the sale of timber but we have a forest service administrationnot just this one it has been going for a whilewhere production has either slowed dramatically or completely been eliminated even though pine trees where i live are an entirely renewable resource you plant them and you are ready to harvest them in 15 20 years we are not talking sequoias we are just talking a renewable resource it is well managed in east texas and other places around the country but since production has stopped and we are buying so much lumber from other countries now it is not good for america not good for our trade imbalance but it has been a federal government policy and it has put schools in an extremely detrimental position especially in rural areas especially in areas where there have been national forests so it is nice to have another bandaid so to speak to address that issue it should have been in here it should have been done before now but on the other side getting back to 140 billion that is not offset by cuts anywhere else adding it into the intergenerational theftand it also concerns me we had 212 republicans today that voted for this sgr fix it would have been so easy to have enough of an adjustment into this bill that we could add six more republicans and it would have been able to pass without any republican leader begging for support from the democrats without coming to support from conservatives with the vote on dhs funding we saw 167 republicans voted against it because it didnt keep our promise to stop the illegal unconstitutional amnesty that dhs had done as ordered by the president and there were 75 republicans some of whom are very conservative but they did vote with the speaker on that bill and with the majority of democrats to pass that funding but i think that gives us an indication that out of the republican conferencethe massive portion of the republican conference represents very conservative districts and there are republicans that thank god we have that are from more moderate areas but somewhere between onefourth and onethird perhaps it just seems like this bill today was one of those bills where we would be better off if we negotiated a deal among the republicans and go through regular order that is what we promised you put us in the majority we will go through regular order we will have hearings on this entire bill there will be open opportunities to discuss it to amend it to have legislative hearings before you even do the votes on it in committee we didnt do that the bill was filed 2 days ago on the 24th we had a couple of days with this bill that is not adequate for something this important it does add some means testing for seniors it appears very clear it is going to cause healthcare providers to have to add more clerical workerspeople that dont do health care they just do paperwork so there will be more costs so we didnt have a chance to adequately investigate the terminology of this bill and the longterm effects it will have on health care it is kind of important this also came 1 day after we voted for a budget that was important to get to the point where we could have reconciliation that let us deal with important issues like obamacare we passed the budget easily and we had a number of different budgets we could vote for i thought tom price did a good job of marshalling the efforts on that but the point is most of us were so focused on the budget through the vote yesterday that we really had one night to prepare on this sgr with the actual language that was filed on tuesday i was good with the 63 pages dr burgess had used last year but there were over 200 pages i really dont know the longterm effects of what we did and that is why though i have been clamoring for an sgr fix i couldnt vote for it this isnt how we do things we are supposed to first do no harm we dont know what harm we may have done in that bill we know we did some good but we dont know what harm we should have had some more time to analyze this and take the language back to our physicians our healthcare providers and say youre the one doing this youre the one trying to save lives enhance lives what will this do to you what will this language do to you then come back and have the vote so i appreciate the work for those that have been spending so much time on what is often referred to as the doctor fix we definitely needed that as another fix this is more permanent we dont know what the senate will do and that is another one of our problems there is some rather breathtaking news that has come out today about what the obama administration has done in the way of damage to the nation of israelit sounds like this action was extremely pettyin an effort to slap israel without proper regard for the fact that they are the most important ally we have anywhere in the middle east and one of the very most important allies we have in the world it is just breathtaking what was done actually to put this in perspective this article march 23 from joel pollak says obamas chief of staff fires up j street israels occupation must end the article says white house chief of staff denis mcdonough earned raucous cheers from the leftwing activists gathered at j streets fifth annual conference in washington on monday when he attacked israels occupation of the west bank an occupation that has lasted almost 50 years must end j street was founded to disrupt the close unitedstates israel alliance and to serve as an alternative to the american israel public affairs committee the powerful proisrael group well that is interesting if we use mr mcdonoughs rationale about the israel occupation and how it must end then that would mean that at the turn of the 20th century if he had been around clamoring for on behalf of this presidentwere he president around the end of the 1800she would have been saying it is time to end americas occupation of texas had he been around in say 1823 speaking for president obama back then had he been president then if he used this same reasoning he would have been saying it is time for the occupation of our thirteen colonies to stop and we give all the land back to england this is no time for the thirteen colonies to continue to occupy what we are calling the united states it is time to give that back to england it was theirs originally the french had some at one time there were differing claims but basically time to quit occupying the united states and give this all back to england it is time to give the west of the united states you might have heard him say if he had been around in the early 20th century time to give back all the west to whoever had it before whether it was mexico spain whoever may have been claiming it we have been occupying it that is not the way the world works that is not the way the united states worked native american tribes were constantly taking each other on different parts of the country taking over others land that has gone on around the world when you have a group of people living in the nation of israel saying we refuse to ever recognize israels right to exist we want to wipe the jewish people off the map we want to wipe israel off the map then that is not a nation that you sit down with then when you have a nation like iran that is doingthey make clear even as of last week that the top leaders in iran want death to america well apparently when this administration hears a religious fanatic that has killed american soldiers killed american civilians has really been at the lead of killing americans wherever they could find them and have an opportunity to kill them and want to wipe israel off the map as the little satan and wipe america off the map as the great satanthey have continued to pursue nuclear weapons and while this administration was rushing and continue to rush to talk to the leaders in iran it leaves some of us aghast at how blind the administration can be as to who is our friend and who is our enemy it was denis mcdonough this article talks about speaking to the group according to this article that was founded to disrupt the close relationship between unitedstates and israel and he fired them up saying the occupation that lasted almost 50 years must end it reminded me oh yeah i remember another speech he gave and this transcript is from the white house web site this was march 6 of 2011 and denis mcdonough the same guy that thinks we need to run israel out of the land of israel he said thisand i am quoting from the speech from the white house web site thank you imam magid for your very kind introduction and welcome i know that president obama was very grateful that you led the prayer at last summers iftar dinner at the white house which as the president noted is a tradition stretching back more than two centuries to when thomas jefferson hosted the first iftar at the white house thank you also for being one of our i might parenthetically interject here into mr mcdonoughs speech glowing praise for imam magid that actually this is imam magid who was president of the islamic society of north america the islamic society of north america a little background on them they were named as a coconspirator to fund terrorism in the largest prosecution in the united states history for funding of terrorismthis was in a united states district court in dallasin short referred to as the holy land foundation trial they were the main defendant their principals the list of unindicted coconspirators from that trial included the council on american islamic relations cair the islamic society of north america isna and the north american islamic trust nait these coconspirators were not tried in the first round of prosecutions in dallas under the bush administration but in november of 2008 all five defendants were convicted on a massive number of charges of supporting terrorism the evidence utilized in the first round of the prosecutions some that participated anticipate would be used in another trial against other named coconspirators if they were successful in getting the first convictions which they did however before the convictions were finalized there was an election president obama was elected president and we got a new attorney general and they decided despite what the evidence showed despite what the courts had found they are not going to prosecute the islamic society of north america and caircair has a very lovely building just down the street from us here i can see cair from my window in the case in dallas cair nait isna they filed pleadings demanding that the judge remove their names as coconspirators in supporting terrorism the judge reviewed all the evidence had the hearing and he ruled that their names would not be struck as coconspirators because there was plenty of evidence to support them as coconspirators supporting terrorism they appealed that to the fifth circuit court of appeals for the united states and the fifth circuit in their order confirmed that there was a prima facie case made that the entities cair nait isna those associations have strong associations with the muslim brotherhood namely hamas its palestinian branch which was specifically designated as a terrorist organization by the unitedstates government anyway the organization here that the federal courts found had plenty of evidence to make a case against them as supporters of terrorism have become partners with this administration and that is why denis mcdonough who was getting the acclaim for demanding israel leave part of israeli territory he was there back in 2011 giving praise to imam magid thanking him for his wonderful prayers at the white house this is a guy that is president of what two federal courts have said had plenty of evidence to show they are coconspirators in supporting terrorism this business about oh the long tradition going back to thomas jefferson of iftar at the white house iftar is the celebration during the month of augustor after the fasting during the month of august for the religious observance of muslims and iftar is the feast after the fasting if you go back to what they say was the first iftar under thomas jefferson it doesnt appear to me that jefferson realized he was having an iftar dinner he wanted to have a dinner with a muslim leader and he couldnt do it until the fasting was over and so when he could eat they had a meal it is kind of like hearing people say well thomas jefferson having a copy of the koran shows how openminded it was no it shows the fact that he had been a diplomat negotiating with radical islamists called barbary pirates as to why they kept capturing united states navynot navybut seamen and holding them for ransom they had so many of our sailors that they held in captivity we were paying a massive part of our budget for ransom to get these back jefferson was one of those that went over and negotiated and apparently asked why do you keep attacking us we dont even have a navy why you are attacking us we are not a threat to you he was reportedly told in our religion we believe that if we die while attacking you an infidel we go to paradise jefferson was so well read he couldnt believe there was a religion that thought you could go to paradise if you die killing innocent people so he got his own english translation of the koran his ultimate action was to create and send a new thing called united states marines to the shores of tripoli because he realized there is not going to be any negotiation that is adequate to deal with these radical islamists there is only one way to beat them and that is to physically beat them in a fight to the finish it kept them off our backs for some time well that is denis mcdonough speaking for the president in 2011 and now then we know that the white house is doing everything it can to bend over backwards the state department oh iran what can we do for you okay now we find out today they are going to let them have centrifuges spinning in their secret facility they didnt even disclose until we found out about it and they are going to let them keep having centrifuges spin there look they will almost do anything to get them to sign some kind of agreement bending over backwards but they cant spare a minute to meet with the leader of israel cant spare the president vice president or one of the cabinet to come listen to netanyahuoh no then today this outrage has come to light that the united states the obama administration has declassified a document that reveals israels nuclear program to the world especially to iran and to those who want to destroy israel so they will know exactly what they are after what they are up against what has happened what has come to light today of this administration declassifying a document obviously it is a slap at netanyahu it is a slap at the israeli people for coming out in droves to support a group of representatives that this president doesnt approve of we are betraying this great ally of ours israel if you believe the bible judgment will be coming down on our country for what our elected officials and appointed officials have done in betraying israel there will be problems for this if you dont believe the bible then just use common sense when you betray your most trusted ally in this tornapart middle east then you are going to have problems galore i have talked with leaders in those countries i cant now because the speaker wont let me go talk to them overseas anymore that is what you call retribution if you dont support the speaker i get that i am fine with that as a result of him canceling my trip this weekend i get to be on fox news anyway thank you somebody needs to be friendly to our allies and stand up against our enemies and this administration is not doing it this betrayal is going to do more damage in the world than the snotty little act that was intended to slap at netanyahu and the israeli voters than we could possibly imagine this is just unbelievable now if you believe that there are lessons worth noting in the bible you could go back to king hezekiah who entertained the babylonian leaders if you believe the account in the bible god sent isaiah to hezekiah and asked him what have you done he already knew but hezekiah said in effectand this is texas paraphrasewell we met with these lovely wonderful leaders from babylon and we showed them all of our treasure in the most correct translation he adds and we showed them all of the defenses we have in our arsenal isaiah basically says because you have done that you fool you will lose the country this is the kind of thing that brings down nations it was petty and it was a betrayal and people need to be called to account for it i yield back the balance of

for their support i rise today to encourage my colleagues to support the bipartisan h r 1816 the vulnerable veterans housing reform act of 2015 this bill would remove an unnecessary barrier that prevents our disabled wartime veterans from receiving the housing assistance they so critically need this body recognized the importance of this issue when it unanimously passed substantially similar bills h r 6361 and h r 1742 during the 112th and 113th congresses unfortunately these bills were not considered by the senate i am hoping the third time is the charm quite simply h r 1816 prevents the department of housing and urban development from considering a veterans aid and attendance benefits as income when calculating their eligibility for housing assistance the aid and attendance benefit is an enhanced pension provided by the department of veterans affairs to our nations wartime veterans who are severely disabled and have little or no income veterans eligible for this benefit are those requiring the aid of another person in order to perform their activities of daily living such as bathing eating adjusting prosthetic devices or protecting themselves from the hazards of their daily environment in order to receive this benefit our severely disabled veterans must first establish their eligibility for a lowincome pension which requires an annual adjusted gross income of less than 12 868 for a single veteran with no dependents once eligibility is determined lowincome disabled vets can receive roughly an additional 8 600 in aid and attendance benefits annually to help defray the cost of their medical care this is an important point this aid and attendance benefit is for medical care it is not discretionary income it is not for groceries it is not for transportation utilities or anything else as you can imagine these lowincome veterans struggle daily to keep the lights on put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads add to that the exorbitant cost of paying for a personal care attendant and it becomes increasingly difficult for them to stay in their homes the department of housing and urban development operates a number of programs that can assist these veterans however current regulations require that the aid and attendance benefit be counted as income when determining eligibility for housing assistance this makes no sense the va provides this benefit to ensure that our lowincome disabled wartime vets have the necessary resources to receive the medical care they need and have earned now while 8600 per year may seem like a substantial amount of money it doesnt fully cover the cost of a fulltime aide but is much more cost effective than a nursing home or assisted living facility the median annual cost for a licensed home health aide in 2014 was about 19 000 the cost of an assisted living facility was 42 000 and the median cost of a room in a nursing home is about 80 000 annually so continuing to count the aid and attendance benefit as income does nothing more than to reduce the housing assistance available to our lowincome disabled vets and jeopardizes their ability to live independently it is the stated goal of both this house and this administration to reduce homelessness in our veterans population the need for this legislative fix is just as strong today as it was last congress and the congress before that most recent statistics from the department of housing and urban development indicate that approximately 50 000 veterans are homeless and we certainly dont want to add to that number h r 1816 will go a long way towards preventing additional homelessness for our nations veterans i urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation"], [0.00018298625946044922, 0.5001829862594604, 0, "i thank the

committee on education and the workforce i was pleased to introduce a bipartisan bill that will help address a number of challenges americans face as they pursue their dream of higher education as students and families explore all of the available options when trying to choose the right college or university they face a daunting number of difficult choices especially when it comes to financing their education deciding how to pay for college is an important decision that could have a lasting impact on a students financeslong after he or she graduates and enters the workforce unfortunately current policies that are supposed to promote the financial literacy of aid recipients often leave students and their families in the dark here is a troubling statistic in a survey of current students and recent graduates who are carrying a high level of student loan debt more than 40 percent couldnt remember ever receiving financial counselingeven though it was required before receiving their first loan with college costs on the rise we need to do more to help students and their families make informed responsible decisions when it comes to financing a postsecondary education that is why i along with representatives allen and bonamici introduced h r this bipartisan legislation will provide americans with the tools they need to better understand their financial aid options and obligations by improving the timing and frequency of financial counseling the bill will empower students and parents to make smart decisions about how to pay for their education and avoid unnecessary financial hardship down the road the bill will require student and parent borrowers to receive financial counseling before even agreeing to a loan helping them understand the responsibilities they are taking on before they sign on the dotted line the bill also enhances the quality of the counseling ensuring it is tailored to a borrowers unique needs and circumstances the same is true for certain students who rely on pell grants to finance their education under this legislation students who receive a pell grant but never receive a federal student loan would also have to receive annual counseling to ensure they are aware of the grants terms and conditions just as importantly this bill will bolster exit counseling to help student borrowers understand their responsibilities as they leave school this legislation will help ensure students understand their options and obligations when they begin their college careers and when they graduate while it is important for students and parents to understand their functional obligations it is important for them to understand their financial options as well for example while federal loans have a number of benefits for borrowers certain state nonprofit and private loans may actually have more beneficial annual percentage rates particularly at the graduate and parent levels an accurate comparison is important because it will allow students and parents to make the decision that is best for them together these and other reforms in the bill will empower students and their families to make informed responsible decisions when deciding how to finance their higher education i urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bipartisan legislation i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0004012584686279297, 0.5004012584686279, 0, "i
