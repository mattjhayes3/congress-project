appreciate the spirit in which the chairman and the ranking minority member have brought this bill out and have amended it to make it very clear that there can be no abuses i think one of the lines of criticism of the previous speaker banged into the other one he said in the first place this would divert too much money from pension funds then he said that nobody but the aflcio wants to use it well if in fact nobody but the aflcio wanted to use it it would not be diverting all that much money from the pension fund let us be very clear noting in this bill is mandatory nothing in this bill tells any pension fund what to do with its money this is no public sector takeover of anything this is the public sector responding to a request that did come from the aflcio for doing a general bill limiting the amount in the version that is before us that any one pension fund can have and it says we will help you if you want to do it second nothing in this legislation and the gentlewoman from new jersey is an expert in this field and made sure of that nothing in this legislation relaxes one comma of any existing law governing pension funds no fiduciary responsibility no safeguards none of that is relaxed in fact that is why we have this bill some pension funds like the aflcio said they would like to get into housing now the gentleman says what about jobs well some of us think that building housing is a job the gentleman may not but very few houses descend from heaven in perfect form mostly they need a little carpeting the fact is the aflcio pension fund consists of some people who are in the building trades and yes very probably some of those in the building trades would want to use their pension funds for housing augu8t 2 1993 now the gentleman says that is a diversion from entrepreneurship well if the people in the building trades want their pension funds to which they have contributed to go into projects where they can go to work the gentleman from pennsylvania my not like it but it is not any of his business because it is their pension funds we are not telling them to do anything he is right this will not be what every pension fund or even most pension funds will want therefore he is wrong when he says it will be a major diversion from entrepreneurship every restriction every safeguard every rule governing the safety and security of pension funds remains absolutely intact that is why we have this bill what we are saying is that housing might be lowincome housing housing for people of moderate income multifamily housing might be considered too risky for pension funds given existing law so what does this bill do it simply says that a certain percentage of section 8 already voted it has not added a penny to the amount that is voted it says the secretary shall take some of the section 8 already voted and work with pension funds that want to get into the housing business to leverage that money so that it will reduce the risk it recognizes that pensions must be kept secure the gentleman said well what about these workers they may be worried about their pension funds they would be worried and that is why without the section 8 they may not get into that kind of housing the purpose of this is so to some extent people in the building trade put their pension money into jobs that they will get that will produce housing that we need and at no additional cost to the federal government there will be that degree of security that allows them to go forward that is what the bill does i frankly think that we have some people in the house who figure that if unions are involved it must be a bad thing people i think undercut their credibility if anytime we talk about anything with a union somehow that is to be the cause of anathema we have some people who have said we would like to use our pension funds for housing and we would be willing to do it for lowincome housing if you could help us bring down the risk so we are saying in this bill okay we will give you some of the section 8 already voted that will bring this housing within the existing rules that govern pension funds that is what the bill does and i hope it is agreed
