right to demand a hearing when epa has proposed to retain a pesticide by additional restrictions on its use rather than canceling its use section 6 b of fifra entitles persons adversely affected by a proposed cancellation action to challenge this decision in an administrative hearing epa in reviewing registered pesticides for possible unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment through the rpar process has utilized the risk benefit analysis as a result in many cases is able to continue the use of pesticides by incorporating restrictions such as usage limitations improved application directions or more emphatic label warnings epa in 1979 made an administrative decision in interpretation of adversely affected that only registrants and users of pesticides which are those with an economic interest in the continued registration of a pesticide were entitled to a hearing under section 6 b the public interest groups although they may have participated in the rpar process still feel they should be able to demand an administrative hearing to challenge this type of action saying it has not gone far enough and that in effect the pesticide use should be canceled the public interest groups unsuccessfully challenged this administrative ruling in court the court ruled that congress intended to provide an administrative hearing only when a pesticide use is being canceled not when its use is being retained conditionally since the public interest groups have an input in the rpar process and have the opportunity to appear before the fifra scientific advisory panel all before the final decision is made and then may challenge this refusal to cancel in federal district court under the provision of section 16 a i feel that adequate safeguards have been provided and this amendment should be rejected i might point out that the subcommittee considered this proposal during its deliberations and determined that such language was not needed for those who are more interested in the details of this issue i will continue further the rosenthal amendment to section 6 b of fifra provides that whenever epa proposes to place regulatory restrictions on a product any interested person may compel epa to hold a courtroomtype cancellation hearing for the purpose of determining whether even greater restrictions should be imposed on the product than those epa decided on my prob lem with this amendment is not with its underlying conceptthat any interested member of the public should be able to request stricter regulatory action my problem is with the procedure chosen to do thisthe formal courtroomi ype cancellation hearing a cancellation hearing is a lengthy timeconsuming resourceconsuming piece of litigation it is simply bad law and bad policy to make cancellation hearings the vehicle for regulatory decisions as to how strictly pesticides should be regulated yet that would be the primary effect of the rosenthal amendment i believe that all interested persons should have an input into epa decisions as to how strictly to regulate pesticides but as i will show that opportunity is already provided under current law during the administrative review process because cancellation hearings under section 6 b are really formal litigation they serve a very narrow purpose it would be a grave mistake to adopt the rosenthal amendment and thereby turn them into something they were never intended to be and that is essentiallyunworkablea forum for deciding how strictly to regulate pesticides the issue raised by the rosenthal amendment is not whether environmental groups should have the same right to demand a cancellation hearing under section 6 b as a pesticide registrant that is a false issue rather the issue is what is the proper time and place for the public to have input on how strictly a product should be regulated is the proper procedure as i contend for the public to make its beliefs known during the agencys regulatory review process or is the proper procedure as mr rosewhal contends to decide regulatory issues through administrative litigationthat is to let any person demand that a formal courtroomlike cancellation hearing be held to redecide how strictly to regulate a product whenever a person feels that epa has not been strict enough i believe that cancellation hearings under section 6 b should not be the forum for redeciding regulatory issues the proper time for the public to comment on how strictly to regulate a product is during the administrative review process if anyone thinks that epa was not strict enough after an administrative review that person has the right to take epa to court under section 16 a of fifra and ask the court to review what epa has done cancellation hearings serve the narrow purpose of giving a registrant a right to due process of law if his product is going to be canceled they should not be expanded as proposed in the rosenthal amerdment into a device for deciding anew epa decisions that a person does not like i believe the logic of my position becomes even more clear when one understands the different purposes served by administrative review on the one hand and by cancellation hearings on the other epa decisions as to whether to impose restrictions on a product or even cancel a product are made in an administrative review process called an rpar rebuttal presumption against registration every person has a full right to participate in this regulatory process and to urge that a product be strictly regulated and to provide to epa any data or arguments in support of his position if the person feels that epa has not been strict enough at the conclusion of the rpar he can sue epa in federal court and obtain review of epas decision this is in fact made crystal clear in an amendment in h r 5203 to section 16 of fifra concerning judicial review in summary epa has found based on many years of experience that the administrative review or rpar is the best procedure for deciding how strictly to regulate and that is the proper time and place for the public to participate and express its views on how a product should be regulated in contrast a cancellation hearing under section 6 b serves a very different and narrow purpose when epa proposes to cancel a product the registrants and other adversely affected persons can request a formal hearing to protect their procedural right to make sure that the cancellation is carried out in accordance with due prdcess of law cancellation hearings are very rare very expensive for the taxpayer very time consuming and resource consuming and very burdensome on epa there have been only a handful of such hearings since epa was created in 1970for ddt aldrin and dieldren heptachlor and chlordane and 2 4 5t they typically last for a minimum of 6 months and can take years to complete they consist of an administrative trial conducted in the same manner as a trial in federal court they require the public to foot the bill for the time of a team of agency lawyers and administrative law judge they take epa scientists away from their duties and require them to spend time testifying and in crossexamination for periods of days or weeks because cancellation hearings are rare they are an acceptable procedure for protecting registrants due process rights to a hearing but they are clearly an ineffective and undesirable mechanism for making routine decislons as to how strictly epa should regulate particular products they result in legal decisions made by lawyers and administrative judges not in regulatory decisions made by epa scientists and policymakers if the rosenthal amendment were adopted epa would be inundated with these cancellation hearings the amendment would give extraordinary power to a single individual to tie up epas regulatory resources in unproductive litigation a single person could demand a hearing on virtually every epa regulatory decision and force epa to spend months or years trying its case before an administrative law judge after the agency had alfeady fully considered the evidence and reached a decision through its administrative review this clearly would be unwise the law should stay as it is the public should provide its input during the administrative review at the time when epa makes its regulatory decisions if a cancellation hearing is held of course the public should continue to have the right as it does now to participate in it and the public should continue to have the right as it does now to get judicial review of epa regulatory decisions but a person should not be able to tie epa in knots by demanding that lengthy and expensive cancellation hearings be held whenever they feel that epa has not been quite strict enough epa should spend its resources regulating not litigating for these reasons i oppose the rosenthal amendment and suggest that the spirit of full public participation in the regulatory review

this afternoon will deal with how we can cut down the deficit for 1983 and indeed create a balanced budget for fiscal year 1983 beginning on october 1 primarily let me observe that today 928 000 workers in the construction industry are out of work that is 18 1 percent of the total in that industry two hundred and fifty thousand of the workers in the automobile industry are out of work that is 20 8 percent of the workers in that industry these two industries together total 1 178 000 workers who are out of work because of a decline in their industries the principal question is why in the opinion of this member from california the reason or the answer to that question is highinterest rates currently the prime in this country is about 16 percent how do we get that prime rate down the answer is that we must reduce the quantity of borrowing which the federal government contemplates taking from the credit markets over the course of the next year how do we do that we have got to reduce the size of the deficit now when you serve in this house in this institution it almost exudes from the walls that you really cannot cut spending of the federal government that it is part and parcel of the premises and it is impossible to really do it well this member from california yesterday made a presentation to the budget committee whereby a plan was presented that we could balance the budget in 1983 i would like to talk about that this afternoon as we prepare to do battle over the budget this year as we have done in the past i am sure that all of us are not just a little more uneasy this time about the budgetary socioeconomic financial and political ramifications of being confronted with the largest deficit in our nations history we are simply not following the script very well which if we recall why our constituents sent us here 18 months ago calls for movement in the opposite direction we are supposed to be balancing the budget not busting it it becomes imperative therefore for us to find an alternative to the administrations fiscal year 1983 budget a chief obstacle which has thus far prevented us from coalescing around an acceptable substitute is the continuing debate over economic assumptions in february the office of management and budget indicated that the fiscal year 1983 deficit would be 107 2 billionincluding offbudget itemsthe congressional budget office estimates the onbudget deficit alone will be closer to 157 billion the variation in just the onbudget deficit exceeds 70 percent due to acceptance of differing assumptions as to gnp growth inflation interest rates unemployment and changes in law with fluctuations of as little as 1 percent accounting for billions of dollars in changes to the budget it becomes nearly impossible for us to correctly predict what the final figures will be because of this uncertainty it becomes even more important for the congress to take decisive action on the budget and reduce the projected deficitwhether 100 billion or 200 billionby an amount large enough and meaningful enough to make a critical difference large enough to relieve much of the constrictive pressure on the credit markets and meaningful enough so that the message to both taxpayers and the business community would be clear as to our intention to finally do something about outofcontrol federal spending i submit therefore that despite protestations to the contrary not only must the budget be balanced it can be or to be more exactbecause of continued volatility of economic assumptionsas closely balanced as possible under existing circumstances this can be accomplished by cutting 110 billion from the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit whatever that figure may ultimately be a cut of this magnitude would certainly be large enough to materially affect financial markets and meaningful enough to send a clear message that we are finally serious about putting the nations fiscal house in order my program for reducing the deficit by 110 billion can be divided into two underlying premises seven direct components and two indirect additives as follows premises first measures undertaken to reduce the fiscal year 1983 budget should encompass the final 6 months of fiscal year 1982 as well such measures as freezing current benefit levels scaledback increases selective cuts rescissions deferrals or eliminations ought to be implemented as soon as possible inasmuch as fiscal year 1982 spending is not only excessive to begin with but alsobecause of its exaggerated deficithas contributed significantly to the fluctuating and undermining economic indicators after all the more pessimistic analyses including the congressional budget offices result from the higher deficits interest rates and unemployment and lower productivity and revenues caused by the fiscal year 1982 budget i believe that by attacking the fiscal year 1982 deficit at least partially we will affect the economic indicators in such a way as to make the administrations original forecasts and assumptions more feasible and acceptable and even though it may be too late to reduce actual spending for this yearfiscal year 1982in many programs budget cuts based upon fiscal year 1982 levels of spending ought to be possible in most cases this is especially important for two reasons fiscal year 1983 spending is largely an extension of fiscal year 1982as well as previousspending and larger cuts are possible in the more egregiouslyinflated fiscal year 1982 budget than in its fiscal year 1983 successor witness the increase from fiscal

disagreement of jurisdiction between osha and msha i offered this amendment last year to the labor department appropriation bill to provide needed regulatory relief to a variety of small businesses regulated presently byp the mine safety and health administration the purpose of my amendment was to deny funcl to msha to enforce its inflexible rules and regulations against certain industriesnamely the sand gravel crushed stone clay and colloidal phosphate industriesand thereby effect their transfer to the regulatory jurisdiction of osha let me stress that these industries were not to be left unregulated but would have been transferred at their request to osha which has certainly not been traditionally considered a patsy for the business community this amendment was subsequently adopted by the house and later added by the senate to the continuing resolution which would fund msha for fiscal year 1981 unfortunately during the fight over the congressional pay raise issue the amendment was lost along with a hundred other amendments and therefore did not become law decpite the overwhelming congressional supportboth in the house and in the senate i am today offering this amendment my amendment accomplishes the objectives of a bill currently cosponsored by 153 members of this body h r 1603 h r 1603 and other similar bills have languished in the health and safety subcommittee of the education and labor committee in the 96th congress and now in the 97th congress despite the great support this legislation has from many many members of congress congressmen marlenee and barnardthe principal sponsors of h r 1603 join me in urging your support for my amendment which is necessitated because of inaction by the committee having jurisdiction over h r 1603 two years ago the appropriations committee included language to deny msha funds to enforce complicated and in many instances irrelevant training requirements against these same industries i am pleased to note that prohibition has been continued in the proposal pending before the house today while our action on the training requirements has helped these industries there is still a desperate need for further congressional action my amendment makes it clear that we intend for osha to exercise jurisdiction over not only training of employees working in these industfies but have total responsibility for assuring a safe and healthful workplace the industries i am seeking to have transferred from msha to osha were made subject to the mine safety and health act by the amendments that the congress enacted in 1977 few of us recognized at that time that we were imposing sophisticated regulations designed for large and highly technical operations on small businesses which are located in virtually every community in our country the sand gravel and crushed stone industries the two largest industries affected by the amendment have an average number of employees per operation of 7 and 11 respectively the 1977 act has created continuing confrontations between these small businesses and the federal government this adversary relationship is to no ones benefit the transfer proposed in my amendment will restore a cooperative relationship between federal safety and health experts and the industries for the benefit of the workers the industries which would be transferred are not hazardous industries as their current safety records demonstrate and our acceptance therefore of this amendment will not provide any less safety and health protection to their employees some of my colleagues have suggested that the relief sought by these industries can be administratively accomplished by the mine safety and health administration to date the only significant administrative relief and possibly all that is available under the constraints of the act has come from the socalled compliance assistance visit program which allows msha inspectors to examine an oper ation that has been closed due to seasonal conditions and provide a citation and penalty free inspection prior to its reopening this limited and courtesy inspection is in sharp contrast to oshas program where an operator can request such an inspection at any time the problem is that the 1977 mine safety amendments act leaves the secretary of labor with very little flexibility in providing such relief thus underscoring the necessity for passage of my amendment it is regrettable that this serious regulatory problem which has been the subject of 21 days of hearings in the last congress must be addressed by means of an appropriations rider here today hopefully passage of my amendment will force full house consideration of legislationspecifically h r 1603in the near future to make permanent the changes my amendment would make here today for 1982 what is the actual effect of my amendment my amendment simply provides that the regulation of persons engaged in the surface mining of stone clay colloidal phosphate sand or gravel or with respect to any person engaged in construction activities on the surface area of any coal or other mine for safety purposes is transferred from msha to osha one question often asked about this amendment is does the msha amendment create a void in federal enforcement of safety and health standards over the surface mining of sand gravel stone clay colloidal phosphate as well as surface mining construction no osha under the occupational safety and health act has jurisdiction over these mines osha by its terms applies to all employers engaged in a business affecting comoctober 6 1 981 coi merce title 29 united states code section 652 5 thus osha legally covers mines which are also covered under the mine and safety and health act of 1977 additionally the drafters of osha realized that there was the potential problem of dual regulation thus they included in the act a deferral provision title 29 united states code section 653 b 1 it provides that where another federal agency exercises its own statutory authority to prescribe or enforce occupational safety or health standards then osha will not apply the legislative history of osha shows that the key factor triggering deferral is the exercise of another agencys statutory authority over them in three separate court cases three courts of appeals in our country which incidently are the courts next in authority to the unitedstates supreme court it was held that osha has jurisdiction when any other agency for example federal railroad administration msha et ceterais deprived of their jurisdiction the appropriations limitation has the effect of not providing funding for fiscal year 1982 for the exercise of mshas statutory authority over the surface mines described in the pending amendment thus there will be no exercise of statutory authority by msha the effect of this nonexercise under section 4 b 1 of oshatitle 29 united states code section 653 b 1 thus triggers by operation of existing law the responsibility of osha to assume enforcement activity over the described surface mines let me talk for a minute about the construction industry the construction industry was and still is specifically under osha jurisdiction for safety and health in fact in 1973 the construction industry initiated the call for a single standard separate and apart from the general industry osha standards so that the specific concerns of the construction industry could be adequately addressed this was done on the basis of a study which pointed out the shortcomings overlaps and voids between the general industry and the construction series of osha standards this step published in the federal register in 1979 is an example of longterm cooperation between the construction industry and osha and dedication to a mutual goalsafety with practicability unfortunately those construction contractors worfring on a suirface mine sites are considered to be miners and fall under mshas rules and regulations these socalled miners may be constructing a scale house a garage a new shop building or a structure to house a processing plant biut under the 1977 mine safety and health act they are considered miners ajid they are now subject to rules and regulations established for miners in addition to construction rufles and regulations found under osha let me give you a specific example a construction firm is planning on building a highway along the rightofway the contractor negotiates with a farmer or a rancher for the purchase of stone sand or gravel from a borrow pit on his property suddenly the farmer has become a mineowner and the contractor has become a mine operator this is the result of the msha ruling one day the contractor may greet an osha compliance officer performing an inspection of the site the next day he may find an msha enforcement officer at the gate neither operate under the same rules nor do they use the same or cven similar citations of penalties the contractor must take time from his schedule to accompany each of these federal officials during their inspections or have one of his supervisors do so in addition the contractor must also permit theemployee representative to join the entourageall at the contractors expense this situation is clearly absurd if we are truly serious about budget cuts and cutting down on truly excess federal expenditures then we should be saying you cannot send two inspectors to the same jobsite because there is no reason to pay two people to do one job there is an interagency agreement between the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration which should reduce some of the existing problems however all such memorandums of understanding have a degree of fragility about them in that they commit only those signatory to the document nnd for an unspecified period furthir the agreement reclassifies as mining some operations which have traditionally been regarded as construction it suggests that whenever a construction contractor uses equipment to process or size material which he alone is responsible for excavating he must be covered by the requirements of msha compelling the contractor to provide 24 hours of superfluous training prior to 1 ounce of productive effort from his work force again this cost spiral is all too obvious one construction industry group surveyed its members to get some idea of the cost impact of msha on the construction industry the most conservative estimates of cost impact of msha on the nations highway program place the increase at 1 percent that 1 percent comes to 300 million per year this is only a part of the problem what about the building contractors who purchase their stone sand gravel aggregates cement concrete brick and so forth from suppliers members of the construction industry report that the~r material suppliers costs would increase anywhere from 5 to 10 percent these increases are completely unnecessary one member of the industry stated if the huge msha staff went to the underground mines to work at the mining problem instead of cluttering up the surface landscape with wasteful duplicative efforts we would all benefit now i would like to address those who say that nsha is doing a terrific job and it is changing its waysbecoming more and more receptive i say that msha has not turned over a new leaf the agency and its supporters are making inaccurate statements about its socalled new look that the situations brought to our attention by constituents with stone sand gravel and clay operations as well as surface construction activities have not been resolved conditions have not improved to any appreciable degree during the 96th congress hearings were held on this issue in the house and despite consistent overwhelming testimony from all elements of the noncoalmining industrythese hearings are slated to continue ad finitum with the committee in the house showing no inclination to take action toward resolving the injustices found not just in the administration of the actbut in the act itself certainly there is always need in every industry and service to continually improve safety and health conditions but the policeman approach of msha is not the answer it appears methods of aggravation are the product not constructive efforts to better

introducing the petroleum disruption management act legislation designed to prevent or lessen varying degrees of petroleum disruptions there is an essential need for this legislation the expiration of the emergency petroleum allocation act of 1973 on september 30 of this year will leave a gaping hole in our ability to respond to emergency petroleum shortages unless a new and better national program is substituted for the epaaone that eliminates many of the former statutes shortcomingswe will be faceed with a multitude of state emergency plans which could in fact work to our disadvantage and actually exacerbate a potential regional or national petroleum disruption currently all is well on the petroleum supply front crude oil and petroleum products are plentiful however the glut of crude oil and products has given us a false sense of security the vast majority of energy experts view the glut as only a temporary phenomenon we will undoubtedly have another petroleum crisis it behooves us therefore to address the issue of emergency energy contingency planning particularly now that the political environment is calmer and the opportunity for a more thoughtful and effective approach is available if we wait until we are in the midst of another energy crisis to develop an emergency petroleum policy the result will be quite the opposite of what we want a crisis atmosphere may lead to the development of bad legislationlegislation that could likely result in stricter federal measures than perhaps are necessary instead we need to develop legislation now that will help minimize regional shortages before they become national crises while at the same time providing the president with authorities to deal with a national energy emergency the intent of the legislation is to give the president the flexibility and the necessary management tools to deal with petroleum disruptions in a timely and effective manner the options outlined in this bill would allow the marketplace to work to the maximum extent possible so that we do not have to depend on massive regulatory action by the federal government to find solutions to energy disruption problems the bill would require the president for instance to submit a report on the advisability of using tax incentives to encourage refiners to stockpile crude oil and products during periods of surplus more importantly it would require the president to develop four management programs which when approved by congress would be placed on the shelf for selection at a later time they would be removed for implemenjuly 28 1 981 tation only upon approval by congress the programs would be designed to address particular kinds of disruptions ranging from substantial regional shortages to severe national emergencies the four programs are based on the following first use of the strategic petroleum reserve second use of private dedicated reserves third implementation of national crude oil sharing and fourth use of petroleum product management techniques the first management tool would be used to deal with either regional shortages of a lesser magnitude or fullblown national emergencies to address either kind of situation the department of energy would be authorized to sell oil from the strategic petroleum reserve upon determination by the president of the need to respond to an imminent or existing disruption the second tooluse of private dedicated reserveswould serve as a transition program to deal with regional problems until the strategic petroleum reserve was filled to a desirable level the pdr would give regional refiners access to crude oil it would be operated as a limited exchange program between designated refiners with adequate supplies and qualified refiners who because of the disruption would be forced to operate below the national utilization rate to be eligible to receive crude oil from designated refiners those qualified refiners would be required to meet specified standards such as retrofitting their refineries having the capability to process heavy or sour crude oil and maintaining specified inventories as a result inefficient refiners would be prevented from gaining access to crude oil an exceptions procedure would allow other refiners to qualify for crude oil on a casebycase basis the third techniquea national crudeoilsharing programis designed to meet a severe national shortage refiners operating above the national average would be required to share crude oil with those refiners operating below the average the final techniquethe petroleum product management programwould only be used as a last resort in the event that all other management tools failed to produce an acceptable result the president would have the flexibilty to deal with an extreme emergency as he saw fiteiither by using price and allocation controls a national rebate program or any other plan he found acceptable at the time to the maximum extent possible the plan would be designed to protect the following public health safety and welfare national defense the maintenance of public services and the maintenance of agricultural operations related to the production processing and distribution of food a strong point of the legislation is its avoidance of a statistical trigger for the implementation of any of the management plans anyone who has studied the issue of contingency planning has found that it is virtually imposible to develop such a trigger given the vast array of potential regional and national shortage situations the most realistic and effective trigger is a political one key language in the bill would require the president and congress to act in concert in implementing one of the management programs at the same time the bill would automatically sunset the activating resolutions within 120 days unless reauthorized by congress thereby avoiding longterm government involvement in developing his contingency plans and in responding to petroleum disruptions the president would benefit from the advice of a cabinetlevel emergency energy council and energy advisory committee composed of industry representatives consumers and petroleum users the energy advisory committee in particular could be used to persuade industry to manage regional shortages thereby preventing the implementation of any of the four standby management plans this bill with its focus on sequential management sends the right signals to the country it asks government to develop a feasible plan during a noncrisis situation it asks the private sector to depend on selfhelp measures to meet its basic energy needs warning private industry not to expect a massive bailout by uncle sam in par ticular it tells small and independent refiners to retrofit and sour up if they want to become eligible for crude oil sharing during a disruption it builds tension into the system to prevent escalation to the final stage of sequentlil management by giving the advisory councils an opportunity to use jawboning and other measures short of federal intervention to solve disruption problems it only supplements the marketplace to protect national secarity public safety and health and our agricultural community and finally while it does give the president discretionary authorities to act during an emergency the authorities can be used only with the cooperation of congress during the spring of 1979 my home state of iowa and most of the midwest for that matter experienced severe shortages of diesel fuel yet the nation as a whole did not since fuel was in generally plentiful supply this is the kind of problem that i believe will be more typical of the energy problems that we will experience in the future while the diesel fuel shortages of 1979 gave the appearance of being a national problem they were in fact only characteristic of a regional disruption the 1979 experience highlights the fact that rural america is particularly vulnerable to supply disruptions when supplies get tight those refiners serving rural markets tend to be the first ones to feel the pinch because they are the ones who are crude deficient had we had a petroleum disruption management act on the books during the spring of 1979 i feel confident the high spot market prices and the shortages we experienced would have been prevented and they would have been prevented without massive government intervention i believe the concept of sequential management is an innovative and a realistic approach to a very tough issue i believe this bill can serve as a starting point as we study contingency planning issues and reach agreement on a suitable replacement for the emergency petroleum allocation adt i urge my colleagues to join with me by cosponsoring this legislation a fact sheet on the bill follows petroleum disrupton management act or purpose provide president with flexibility and management tool s to deal with varying degrees of potential regional and national petroleum disruptions allows for selection from those tools to beat respond to given circumstances in a disruption substitute for emergency petroleum allocation act preempt multitude of conflicting state emergency plans develop legislation in noncrisis environment designs set of tools before disruption occurs procedure require president to develop 4 management plans to be approved by congress and placed on standby to deal with disruptions disruption management plans 1 strategic petroleum reserve spr doe reports to congress on analysis of minimum volumes of reserves to be maintained as necessary for national defense needs spr plan to be modified to allow use of spr oil during substantial regional and national crude oil disruption once adequate volume is available 2 private dedicated reserve pdr provide crude access to deal with regional shortages designated refiner major seller operating in excess of national average would sell to qualified refiner small and independent a whose runs fall a specified percentage below average and b who cannot replace lost supplies through own efforts except by paying price in excess of weighted average price considering economicallybased quality differentials additional requirements may be placed on refiner to maintain qualified status reconfigure heavy sourup storage exceptions procedure would allow other refiners to apply for qualified status on a casebyase basis program operation price paid would not exceed weighted average price during prior 60 days for domestic and imported oil including adjustments for transportation gravity sulfur and handling our service charge reimbursement mechanism provided for designated refiners seller equalization pdr function could be replaced by spr once adequate fill levels for dealing with substantial disruption 3 national crude oil sharing program provides for sharing of crude oil among all regions and areas during national shortage any refiner operating above national average would sell to those operating below average weighted average price plus adjustments would apply 4 petroleum product authorities in the event of a national emergency president would have authority to implement price and allocation controls or an emergency use fee with with~out rebate or any other program specified i regulation would only be implemented as measure of last resort priorities same as those in current epaa legislation measures used prior to activation of plans dependence on private stocks and marketplace energy advisory committee composed of all segments of petroleum industry consumers and users to help persuade industry to manage regional shortages presidential study to determine advisability of providing tax incentives to encourage stockpiling during surplus and drawdown during shortage president can utilize 300 000 barrels of spr oil per day for 90 days without approval of congress to mitigate regional lyhortages implementation process trigger president determines with consent of congress that particular management plan should be pulled off shelf president may utilize spr or pdr to distribute and allocate crude oil if a substantial crude oil supply disruption exists or is imminent substantial disruption encompasses regional shortages whether due to price anomalies or supply restrictions president may implement spr national crude sharing or standby product authorities if severe petroleum supply interruption exists or is imminent or to comply with iea obligations such action also requires passage of a joint resolution by congress severe interruption covers national shortfalls congress may initiate and require any of the above actions through passage of a joint resolution presidential veto rights apply with congressional override of twothirds joint resolution minimum number of cosponsors for initiation and priority treatment for vote within a short period of time any program activated cannot exceed 120 days without reauthorization key features and advantages of this legislation n~o government intervention in the marketplace if no disruption gives president discretionary but not unlimited authorities keeps congress involved both as a potential initiator and as a check on excessive action allows for flexible and timely response to disruptions without specifying a mandatory numeric trigger deals with variety of disruptions thus minimizing adverse price and supply effects on agriculture and other sectors encourages selfhelp measures from private industry minimizes regional shortages before they become national crises sunsets
