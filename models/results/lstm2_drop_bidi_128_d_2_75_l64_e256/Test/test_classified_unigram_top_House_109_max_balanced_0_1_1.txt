the men and women in uniform who volunteered to serve because whatever that call is that our commanderinchief deems in our national interest and the congress supports the actions for they are the ones standing in harms way they are the ones willing to make the sacrifice over this august district work period like many of my colleagues i spent a lot of time with the men and women in uniform from my home state the 196 th field artillery brigade just got back from a year in afghanistan i welcomed them home and then i traveled to nashville to spend several hours with them and their families going through the slide slows and listening to the success of their mission there and i am so very proud that they would volunteer to serve and that they would be willing to step up so i begin today just by honoring them and i know the house stands behind them but where we are seeing some confusion is the messages that are coming out across the country here in the middle of a very divisive election year that frankly are at best mixed messages to our troops in the field and at the very worst not helpful at all and i really hate that because i know that the greatest generation who set the standard for sacrifice and courage in our country would want us to attempt to work through our sometimes petty division and right now political division to stand at the waters edge united against this threat and there are people in this country who frankly do not want to acknowledge it the wall street journal editorialized last week and called it an aversion to conflict meaning that there are people in this country that just do not want to be bothered they do not want to accept the fact that these threats are real i also spent all of august reading and i would encourage people to read londonistan how the radical islamists the jihadists the people who are literally waging war and believe that death is the only end are spreading like wildfire through great britain and europe through the mosque and radicalization is taking place so fast that we need to wake up as a nation 0l 2100 i have been here 12 years but sometimes i feel like paul revere when you know something in your heart you better not be quiet about it you better speak out about it the gentleman from texas and i serve on the homeland security appropriations subcommittee for 4 years we have had the detailed briefings of some of these threats and while we cannot speak of some things we know that hezbollah is the a team in terrorism around the world al qaeda has been seriously hit by us we have dismantled a lot of their operations we have killed zarqawi we have had a lot of success but hezbollah now has reared its ugly head in a way that threatens the entire free world and they want by their own charter and definition the destruction of israel and christians that is the truth that is in their charter i would encourage you to read while europe slept about the rest of europe and the radicalization that is taking place there and be sensitive to what is happening in northern africa where just this week we finally established a unitedstates command why because somalia is at risk i was there last summer in eastern africa i came back and talked about the problems that we face with the potential of the terrorist networks and the jihadists looking for a vacuum in leadership the sudan somalia algeria where they can go in and find another sovereign nation from which to operate like they had in afghanistan that was one of the great successes of removing saddam hussein as we took iraq out of the picture of having a sovereign nation from which the terrorists could operate but this war has not gone perfectly but as senator mccain said 2 weeks ago on meet the press no war we have ever fought went perfectly we have never entered a war and not made mistakes of course mistakes have been made that is the essence of war but i am reminded of what john stuart mill said about war this is where the veterans come in our troops in the field he said war is an ugly thing but it is not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feelings which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse he said a person who has nothing for which they are willing to fight nothing they care more about than their own personal safety is a miserable creature who has no chance of ever being free unless those very freedoms are made and kept by better persons than himself and those better persons men and women of the house are our nations veterans our sons and daughters and friends and relatives that are in harms way today looking back asking often to each other does this country stand behind us does the elected leadership of the united states congress believe in this mission will we be successful or will we go home early those are serious questions of war and peace of freedom or tyranny whether or not there is ever going to be a hope of us instilling some democratic systems in a part of the world that frankly is breeding hate and destruction directed right at us the chronology that you have heard some of today was articulated well by a unitedstates navy captain in pensacola florida i want to read it into the record and then submit it for the record it takes a minute but this really capsulizes the threats we face that some people are in denial of and some people do not want to acknowledge that this is worse than it was on september 11 in terms of the global proportions of the terrorist networks the jihadists working together hamas hezbollah al qaeda it is growing but it did not just start he writes it was a cool fall day in november 1979 in a country going through a religious and political upheaval when a group of iranian students attacked and seized the american embassy in tehran the seizure was an outright attack on american soil it was an attack that held the worlds most powerful country hostage and paralyzed a presidency the attack on the sovereign unitedstates embassy set the stage for events to follow for the next 25 years america was still reeling from the aftermath of the vietnam experience and had a serious threat from the soviet union when then president carter had to do something he chose to conduct a clandestine raid in the desert the illfated mission ended in ruin but stood as a symbol of americas inability to deal with terrorism americas military had been decimated and downsized or rightsized since the end of the vietnam war a poorly trained poorly equipped and poorly organized military was called on to execute a complex mission that was doomed from the start shortly after the tehran experience americans began to be kidnapped and killed throughout the middle east america could do little to protect her citizens living and working abroad the attacks against unitedstates soil continued in april of 1983 a large vehicle packed with high explosives was driven into the unitedstates embassy compound in beirut when it exploded it killed 63 people the alarm went off and america hit the snooze button once again then just 6 short months later in 1983 a large truck heavily laden down with over 2 500 pounds of tnt smashed through the main gate of the unitedstates marine corps headquarters in beirut and 241 unitedstates servicemen were killed america mourned her dead and hit the snooze button once more two months later in december of 1983 another truck loaded with explosives was driven into the unitedstates embassy in kuwait and america continued her slumber the following year in september of 1984 another van was driven into the gate of the unitedstates embassy in beirut and america slept soon the terrorism spread to europe in april 1985 a bomb exploded in a restaurant frequented by unitedstates soldiers in madrid then in august of 1985 a volkswagen loaded with explosives was driven into the main gate of the unitedstates air force base rheinmain twentytwo were killed and the snooze alarm was buzzing louder and louder as unitedstates interests were continually attacked fiftynine days later in 1985 a cruise ship the achille lauro was hijacked as we watched an american in a wheel chair singled out from the passenger list and executed the terrorists then shifted their tactics to bombing civilian airlines when they bombed twa flight 840 in april of 1986 that killed four and the most tragic bombing pam am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland in 1988 killing 259 president clinton treated these terrorist acts as crimes in fact we are still trying to bring these people to trial these were acts of war the wakeup alarm was getting louder and louder the terrorists decided to bring the fight to america in january 1993 two cia agents were shot and killed as they entered cia headquarters in langley virginia the following month february 1993 a group of terrorists were arrested after a rented van packed with explosives was driven into the underground parking garage of the world trade center in new york city six people were killed and 1 000 injured still this was a crime and not an act of war the snooze alarm was depressed again then in november 1995 a car bomb exploded at a unitedstates military complex in riyadh saudi arabia killing seven servicemen and women a few months later in june of 1996 another truck bomb exploded only 35 yards from the unitedstates military compound in dhahran saudi arabia it destroyed the khobar towers a unitedstates air force barracks killing 19 and injuring over the terrorists were getting braver and smarter as they saw that america did not respond decisively they moved to coordinate their attacks in a simultaneous attack on two unitedstates embassies in kenya and tanzania where i was these attacks were planned with precision they killed 224 people america responded with cruise missile attacks and went back to sleep the uss cole was docked in a port in yemen for refueling on october 12 2000 when a small craft pulled alongside the ship and exploded killing 17 unitedstates navy sailors attacking a unitedstates warship is an act of war but we sent thefbi to investigate the crime and went back to sleep and of course you know the events of september 11 2001 most americans think this was the first attack against unitedstates soil or in america how wrong they are america has been under a constant attack since 1979 and we chose to hit the snoozealarm and roll over and go back to sleep now this was written by a unitedstates navy captain currently serving this was his speech to a group i submit it for the record you can take issue with that but that is a chronology of what has happened these threats are real and they are building they are growing ladies and gentlemen when zarqawi wrote a letter to zawahari before we killed him he said use the infidels us presence in the middle east iraq to expand the califate from morocco to h6284 co indonesia morocco is in northern africa it is in northwest africa indonesia is way overhere east of saudi arabia and the middle east the califate is frankly jihadist rule expanding their territory this is an aggressive plan documented by their own words people can deny this if they want to but i got to tell you our generation has been called to many many challenges and since the greatest generation set the standard for sacrifice and commitment we have had it really easy in this country but we need to be honest with the american people it is not going to be easy in the coming years at all we are very fortunate we have not beep struck again we are kidding ourselves if we do not think they are planning another attack we are kidding ourselves if we think that this problem will go away if we pull out of iraq what will happen is it will give them momentum it will cause them to recruit more jihadists and more suicide bombers because they will see us in retreat that is the truth this problem is not going away this problem did not just start either it has been building we just did not get serious enough about it until they actually took the towers down which they tried to do 8 years earlier but their engineering was flawed and it did not work that is when they wanted them to come down ladies and gentlemen of the house we have an obligation to try our best to meet at the waters edge i want these volunteer troops and the guard and reserve and active duty to see us united around this issue this is our call this is so important our way of life is worth defending everybody is going to have their role they say oh well you are not over there serving everybody has got a role to play the greatest generation rosie the riveter was the spouse who stayed and worked in the factories and raised the kids so the men could serve and they were people on the floor of this house standing with those troops we need to do it again i will be glad when the next 62 days are over so this is not as much about politics as it is about doing what is right for the men and women in uniform and for global security because the world is looking to us for leadership and i am also grateful that we have had consistent and decisive hardnosed texastough leadership in the white house because this is not a time for wimps this is a time for us to be consistent and be resolute the president has got a big heart i have been with him when he has talked about the families of these troops and there were tears rolling down his face he understands the sacrifice he would never ever put any person in harms way unless he knew deep in his soul that it is in our national interest

agricultur f and for our country we must becom u much more independent from the en s ergy sources abroad but for our farmers and ranchers to remain in business to survive into the future they have got to have access to natural gas and at prices that are affordable natural gas is the primary feed stock the ingredient for the production of many agricultural components but especially for nitrogen fertilizer that is so important and if we are going to produce ethanol in this country if we are going to produce soy diesel we are going to have to have the fertilizer at an affordable price that will allow our farmers to raise the corn and grain sorghum to produce the ethanol to raise the soy beans to produce the soy diesel our farmers are struggling across the country input costs are dramatically on the rise nearly 40 percent of the nitrogen capacity fertilizer capacity has been shut down in this country since 1999 six years ago approximately 15 percent of our fertilizer needs were met in the united states from abroad today 50 percent is imported prices have increased dramatically 250 a ton for nitrogen fertilizer in 2002 today 416 one of my farmers who farms in southwest kansas 30 years ago when he started farming natural gas was 19 cents today it is 9 we are seeing double triple and even fourfold prices that donny young talks about in trying to stay in business with these increasing input costs while the price of corn has stayed the same we in the united states need to become independent if we are going to produce the ethanol and it is important that we remember that natural gas is necessary to make that nitrogen fertilizer i encourage the adoption of this proposal a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture agricultures ability to produce an affordable food supply will continue to face huge obstacles if our nation does not come to grips with its desire to have limitless resources like natural gas for production and not realize that these resources have to come from somewhere our natural gas crisis has two solutionsincrease supply and reduce demand h r 4761 addresses one aspect of this crisis as it will increase the supply of natural gas from the outer continental shelf this additional supply will do two things it will send a strong signal to natural gas markets and could increase the elasticity in north american natural gas markets it indicates to these futures markets that the united states is committed to lifting the moratoria in the outer continental shelf to provide consumers with an additional supply of natural gas this message should ease the volatility in natural gas prices that all of us have seen since 1999 and the additional supply should help ease the natural gas prices over time why does agriculture care so much about this natural gas crisis simply put agriculture is a very large consumer of natural gas farm3 ers use significant amounts of natural gas for food processing irrigation crop drying heating farm buildings and homes and for the pro duction of crop protection chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers natural gas is the primary feedstock in the production of virtually all commercial nitrogen fertilizers manufactured in the untied states natural gas is not just an energy source it is the raw material for producing the fertilizer today in the case of the nitrogen fertilizer anhydrous ammonia natural gas accounts for over 90 percent of the total cash cost of production just like kansas wheat and wisconsin milk fertilizer is a commodity bought and sold worldwide and subject to basic global supply and demand economic principles as the unitedstates domestic nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing sector declines due to high natural gas prices kansas farmers and other unitedstates food producers will be subject to global supply demand forces on the fertilizer products they buy even more so than today the climb in natural gas prices since 2q00 has forced unitedstates fertilizer production costs to unprecedented levels over this period of high prices and intense volatility the unitedstates fertilizer industry began to shut down production nearly 40 percent of the industrys nitrogen capacity permanently shut down between 1999 and today this has and will continue to make unitedstates farmers dependent on offshore production from the major suppliers such as saudi arabia venezuela and russia this rise in natural gas prices and the permanent closure of so much unitedstates fertilizer production has dramatically impacted fertilizer prices throughout the marketing chain and in particular at the farm level according to usda unitedstates prices to farmers for ammonia climbed from 250 per ton in 2002 to 416 per ton in 2005 that is almost a doubling of the price of ammonia to farmers this continued loss of production from the unitedstates nitrogen fertilizer industry would force farmers to rely on a highly uncertain and highly volatile world market with no assurance that they will be able to obtain enough product to meet their full demand this is particularly important when considering the importance of nitrogen to farmers thirty to 50 percent of corn yields are directly attributed to nitrogen fertilizer passing h r 4761 represents a direct positive action to increase our nations domestic natural gas supply to help relieve the high prices pressuring american farmers fertilizer producers and homeowners allowing exploration and development of the outer continental shelf is an essential commitment that our nation must make these natural

bill to designate the federal building located at 333 mt elliott street in detroit michigan as the rosa parks federal building this bill also contains a provision to name the annex to the e brrett prettyman courthouse here in the district of columbia in honor of federal district court judge william b bryant both are legendary african americans and the agreement that federal buildings should be named in their honor is both wide and deep i thank my good friend and colleague from michigan for her diligent leadership on the rosa parks federal building designation i also want to thank my good friend of longstanding the senior senator from virginia senator john warner for tirelessly working with me for more than 3 years to achieve this honor foizjudge bryant i am deeply grateful as well to senate judiciary committee ranking member patrick leary who also was particularly conscientious in pressing for this honor for judge bryant i spoke last wednesday concerning the events that led rosa parks to challenge the daily humiliation of montgomery alabamas black residents who were required to pay their bus fare to the driver then get off and reenter through the rear door and then relinquish their seats and move to the back of the bus upon the demand of any white passenger since then congress has broken with precedent and voted to allow rosa parks to lie in honor in the capitol rotunda and she did so just a few days ago the first woman and only the second african american wh6 has been accorded this honor in so doing the united states of america recognized the unique and extraordinary contribution of rosa parks to her country her simple act of civil disobedience in refusing to relinquish her seat on demand from a white man on a segregated bus was the functional equivalent of a nonviolent shot heard around the world fifty years later time may blur the enormous personal risk rosa parks took on in america in 1955 during our countrys tragic racial history black men had been lynched for less grievances like those of afri6an americans after 400 years of slavery and humiliating discrimination had been resolved by violent revolution throughout human history our country is enormously in rosa parks debt because the revolution that led to the end of government and legally sanctioned discrimination began with a nonviolent revolutionary act setting an example that endured so brave was her act in the south in 1955 that even those of us who were young in school and had nothing to lose did not engage in the first sitins until 5 years later the act of one woman finally led to the mass civil rights movement the missing ingredient in the civil rights struggle this movement was rosa parks special gift to her people and to those who joined them especially the residents of the district of columbia who still feed from her inspiration to achieve equality with other americans includink equal voting rights in the congress of the united states in an era of peacock leaders who strut their stuff her selfless example is an especially important guide in great humility rosa parks gift was not the message that i am doing this to free you her message was faf more direct free yourself it is with gratitude that we bring this bill forward today in that spirit the honor for judge william bryant has an unusual origin indeed the chief judge of the united states district court for the district of columbia judge hogan for himself and all the members of the trial court visited my office to request that the annex under construction for the e barrett prettyman federal building be named for a senior unitedstates judge judge william b bryant judge bryant was unaware ofthe desires and actions of his colleagues who unanimously agreed to request that the annex be named for the judge it is rare that congress names a courthouse or an annex for a judge who has served in that court and even more rare for a judge who is still sitting all who have been involved in this effort recognize and agree that giving an honor to a sitting judge has been granted in the past but only rarely and should be reserved only for the most extraordinary of judges judge william bryant is such a judge li 1600 i am particularly grateful to this house which early understood the unique importance of judge bryants contributions and unhesitatingly passed this bill last session judge bryants colleagues who know his work and his temperament best have found a particularly appropriate way for the court the bar our city and our country to celebrate the life and accomplishments of a truly great judge i know judge bryant personally i know his reputation in this city and in the law and i know that the request to name the annex for judge bryant reflects deep respect for his unusually distinguished life at the bar judge bryant began his career in private practice in the segregated washington of the1940s and 1950s when african american lawyers were barred from membership in the district of columbia bar association and even from using the bar law library he established his legal reputation as a partner of the legendary african american law firm houston bryant gardner and taught at howard university law school his reputation as an extraordinary trial lawyer led to his appointment as the first african american assistant united states attorney for the district of columbia he later rose to become the first african american to serve as chief judge of the united states district court whose members now ask that the annex be named for judge bryant for hisrepresentation of criminal defendants in private practice judge bryant was admired as one of the citys best and most respected trial lawyers among his many notable cases is the landmark mallory v united states a 1957 supreme court decision where the court ruled that an arrested person must be promptly brought before a judicial officer judge bryant was born in wetumpka alabama but grew up in this city and graduated from d c public schools howard university and howard law school where he was first in his class after graduation judge bryant served as chief research assistant to dr ralph bunche when bunche worked with gunnar myrdal the famous swedish economist in his studies of african american racial issues judge bryant served in the united states army during world war ii and was honorably discharged as a lieutenant colonel in the judge who is 94 took senior status in 1982 chief judge thomas hogan wrote that judge bryant lost his beloved wife astaire and now lives alone with this court and the law as the center of his life this unusual request from all the judges of the court gives this designation great credibility i am grateful to the judges of our unitedstates district court here for the thoughtful proposal that honors a washingtonian and a lawyer of historic proportions i very much appreciate the many efforts of my friends in the senate especially senators warner and leahy in helping me to get this bill through both houses i especially appreciate the leadership of this house who went to extraordinary lengths to make sure that this bill would be accomplished

moment as redundancy it is redundant because this is a bill that has been debated and discussed and now it is an amendment to s 403 which creates a lack of opportunity for any legislative initiative to get to the presidents desk far be it for any of us who happen to be parentsand have young women as daughters in our family to try to allow legislation to drive a barrier between a child and her parents nor can we morally allow the creation of chilling fac tors that prevent a youth from seeking help when they desperately need it there lies the angst and the confusion and the misrepresentation of this debate this is not a helpful legislative initiative this is in fact a divisive initiative because we find that more than 61 percent of parents in states without mandatory parental consent or at least 61 percent with notice laws have knowledge of their daughters pregnancy the normal relationship of child and parent proceeds along a very helpful manner as long as we do not provide unnecessary intrusion beyond what has been accepted by the individual states the state of texas has provided that kind of barrier twentythree states have but another 23 have not committed to dividing parent from child the greatest downside of this particular legislation is that it doesnt come to this floor with clean hands if it did it would have allowed us to have amendments and this was a closed rule i offered just a year ago or so an amendment with mr nadler that expanded the exceptions to the prohibitions in this act of being able to assist a young lady in her time of trouble to give exemptions to clergy godparents aunts uncles and first cousins family members and clergy that would be giving comfort to this particular individual who may be a victim of incest or rape and afraid and confused about the utilization or the act of going to their parents although i said that 61 percent do have that relationship there may be others that dont and so that would have been a responsible approach so that clergy would not become felons as well as godparents and aunts or uncles close family members this country is used to and welcomes an extended family families of different configurations and so this legislation attempts to ignore that and sadly what it does is it makes a political point just days away from elections but it doesnt help our young people who may be suffering with the decision that they have to make it may be because of incest or rape or maybe they have been brutalized or they may be frightened and the comfort this particular relative can give them is the kind of nurturing advice that will help them make a right decision maybe we want to subject our young people who may be subjected to decisions by parents who are forcing an abortion it happens on either side and it happened in the case of a 19yearold girl from maine because she was impregnated by an incarcerated person so this is not a question of getting an abortion or not getting an abortion this is a question of imploding family relations and also altering the health system of america it is a health issue it is a health issue if the individual is injured a health issue if it is jeopardizing the life of the young lady and the american medical association the american college of obstetricians alld gynecologists the american college of physicians and the american public health association all oppose mandatory involvement laws because of the dangers they pose to young women and the need for confidential access to physicians so we are being redundant because this is around and around and around this is over and over again but there is no sincerity in passing this legislation because instead of taking s 403 we have offered an alternative that alternative will have to go back to the senate there is some tongueincheek comment about we hope the senate will consider our bill well they are four days before the end of the session before we go off for our work in the district then of course there is a lame duck because this majority republican majority has not finished its work as usual i dont think this is a reality that is going to happen my prayer is that we will come together for the young people and for those impacted by this great tragedy and allow families to make decisions as they should vote down this bill it serves no purpose and it hurts the young people of america and divides families i oppose the legislation before the house s 403 the child custody protection act the provisions contained within this proposal are very inflexible and unreasonably punitive given the usual slant of my good colleagues on the other side of the aisle to favor uniformity in legislation this bill is inconsistent with that purpose overall s 403 would force physicians to learn and enforce 49 other states laws with respect to parentalinvolvement requirements on its face one of the policies that this bill seeks to enforce the mandate that every parent will receive notice and can get involved when their daughter faces a crisis pregnancy is a good one however one of its harmful effects is that it is unnecessarily punitive in the absence of laws mandating parental involvement young women come to their parents beforeor while they consider abortion a study found that 61 percent of parents in states without mandatory parental consent or notice laws had knowledge of their daughters pregnancy major health associations such as the american medical association the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists the american college of physicians and the american public health association strongly oppose mandatory parentalinvolvement laws because of the dangers they pose to young women and the need for confidential access to physicians this legislation poses such a risk by increasing the risk of harm to adolescents by obstructing their access to healthcare that could save their lives in addition wellrespected organizations such as planned parenthood pro choice america and people for the american way have expressed their opposition to this bill which effectively isolates young women in need of help and forces to seek alternative illegal and unsafe venues for terminating their pregnancy after all if you cannot trust your parents or your doctor to help you what are your alternatives according to an article by lawrence b finer and stanley k henshaw only 13 percent of unitedstates counties have abortion providers therefore the fact that many young women seek abortions outside of their home state is not solely attributable to an avoidance of home state law the last time we saw this bill i offered an amendment with mr nadler of new york that expanded the exceptions to the prohibitions of this act to include conduct by clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins this amendment was a very simple but necessary dampening of the excessive punitive nature of this legislation this amendment is also demonstrative of the negative consequences this bill would directly and inadvertently cause a young woman should not lose her right to seek counsel and guidance from a member of the clergy her godparent or the family member if she so desires the mandatory parentalinvolvement laws already create a draconian framework under which a young woman loses many of her civil rights my state texas is
