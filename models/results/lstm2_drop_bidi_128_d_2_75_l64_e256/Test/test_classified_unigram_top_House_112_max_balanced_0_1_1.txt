from watching my colleagues about how to make a good impression you know everybodys back in their offices watching the proceedings on tv or folks back in the district watching it on tv and i see our colleagues come and theyll take the podium down to the very lowest level so that when they walk up to the podium theyll be able to drag it all the way up to the top and look big and strong and powerful you know in the 18 months that you and i have served here weve gotten a lot of advice about how to look good weve gotten a lot of advice about how to tell the good story how to spin the good tale and as i listened to my friend from virginia make his presentation earlier i thought you know what he and i are looking at exactly the same set of facts and we are drawing exactly the opposite set of conclusions and that makes it so hard to legislate here because you and i as part of this freshman class we dont care two hoots about what looks good what we care about is what is good we dont care about trying to make people believe its the truth we care about actually finding the truth and thats been the challenge up here in the 18 months that you and i have had a voting card i have beside me a chart that has been down on this floor a number of times its called a choice of two futures and youve seen it its the one that shows the red line of current spending promises its the one that goes all the way back to 1940 it shows debt as a percent of gdp it shows back at the end of world war ii when we were fighting the nazis we were fighting the japanese we were fighting to defend freedom and democracy around the global in the name of ending that world war we borrowed 100 percent of our economy our national debt grew to 100 percent the size of our economy and that was an investment well made having defended the liberty of citizens around the world but were right back in that same place today this chart goes from 1940 all the way out to 2080 its 140 years of past policy and projected policy and what it shows is that today america is on the verge of carrying that same debt burden were not in the middle of a world war to defend freedom and liberty were not in the middle of fighting the nazis and trying to prevent a hostile takeover of the world but weve borrowed 100 percent the size of our economy but thats not even the most damning part of this chart what we see is represented by this red line if we do nothing if our freshman class had never come to this town if we closed the congress if we closed the white house if we never passed a new law and never made a new promise this red line represents the promises already made and what we see is debt rising to 200 percent 300 percent 400 percent 500 percent the size of our economy levels that economists tell us will never be sustainable and thats if we dont make one new promise on the floor of this house my colleague from virginia spoke passionately about the need for child care in this country spoke eloquently about families at home struggling to balance the demands of work and the demands of child care you see it in your district i see it in my district hes absolutely right about the struggles that every single american family faces and from his words believes in his heart that the right way to address those challenges in my small town of peachtree corners georgia is with a federal program a program that comes right down the street here maybe from the department of health and human services maybe from the department of education but that somehow we can create a program here in washington d c that will be the absolute best and most efficient way to deal with my familys challenges and my neighbors challenges back in peachtree corners georgia what ive learned i serve on the budget committee and the rules committee and listening to my colleagues talk i somehow thought that perhaps there were some dollars here in washington d c that came from somewhere other than my constituents pockets but ive learned thats not the case that every single dollar that this institution spends every single commitment that the administration makes every single project that the senate wants to fund every single dollar comes out of the pockets of my constituents back home and your constituents back home so when we talk abouti think the phrase my friend from virginia used was the antigovernment forces on capitol hill i dont know who those forces are i feel like he was talking about me and this freshman class i dont know of any antigovernment forces what i know about are folks who talk about whats the right level of government to get the american taxpayer the absolute best value for their tax dollar and who are those folks who honestly believe that the best value for their tax dollar back in peachtree corners georgia is to take that dollar out of the back pocket of a hardworking taxpayer in peachtree corners move it through the gwinnett county government move it through the state of georgia government bring it up here to the federal government then send it back down to federal agency thats going to send it back down to a state agency thats going to send it back over to a county government in order to provide child care who believes thats the absolute best and most efficient way to spend an american tax dollar and thats the battle that we have here in this house its not about government and antigovernment its about good government and bad government you know were here in the federal government the federal government and there are responsibilities that we have making war one of our responsibilities defending our border one of our responsibilities maintaining the postal roads one of our responsibilities but there are so many other levels of governmentstate government county government local governmentthat can fulfill some of these needs that my colleagues seem to believe only the federal government is right to fulfill i want to go back to this chart this is the chart of promises already made so often i pick up the newspaper and it sounds like everybody is just complaining up here in washington d c that its all about pointing fingers and that its not about solving problems what i am so proud of in the 18 months you and i have been here under the leadership of some senior members like the gentleman from indiana is that we have not only identified the problem which is a crushing debt burden that threatens the economic security not just of our children and of our grandchildren but of our very republic but that weve promulgated a solution its represented here on the chart by this green line thats labeled the path to prosperity im just so proud i serve on the budget committee my chairman is paul ryan this house came togetherand you dont hear that a lot on the front pages of newspapers this house came together in a bipartisan way to pass a budget not just oncewe passed it for the first time in 2011but again in this year 2012 and weve been waiting on the senate to act its our constitutional obligation to pass that budget each and every year the president has offered one each and every year the house has passed one each and every year but the senate has failed to act we laid out line item by line item as to how we would prevent this most certain destruction of economic liberty and security in our land its represented by this green line it stretches out from 2012 all the way out to 2051 you dont run up trilliondollar debts like were running up and solve it overnight you just cant you cant run up 100 percent of your gdp in debt and solve it overnight we dont have that kind of money we cant levy that kind of tax burden on the american people but we can solve it over time we can keep it from getting worse today and we can make it better tomorrow thats what our plan is i think thats so important again when i listen to it and when i read about it in the newspaper its fingerpointing its whos to blame and whose fault is it and why didnt they do better i dont care whose fault it was i dont care who got us here my knowledge of history tells me there is a lot of blame to go around i care about who is going to get us out of here about who is going to solve these problems about who is going to move us from the precipice of economic disaster back to the robust american economy for which we are known around the globe this house has passed that plan not once but twice what i show here is the budget that the president has introduced i want to give this president his due i come down hereand we saw it with the rule that i managed yesterday and we see it in some of the presentations on the other side of the aisle you come down here and its as if the other side is just evil and thats why nothing works thats just not true at all there are honest hardworking men and women on both sides of this aisle who represent constituents back home who just have very different understandings of who we are as a people some of whom have different hopes and dreams about where we will go as a people some of whom have different needs that theyre asking the government to meet this president got more done in the first 2 years of his term than most presidents get done in eight he was incredibly effective now i would argue that he was incredibly effective in doing things that are destroying the very fabric of freedom in this country but he was incredibly effective of course he won with a majority of the vote here in this nation and he is campaigning to win again this falla smart guy an effective guy with a completely different understanding of who we are as a people and where we should go as a nation than the one that i have but he is a talented politician nonetheless he has honored his legal requirement to submit a budget to this congress each and every year that he has been in office and thats important because that distinguishes him from the united states senate which also has a legal obligation to submit a budget and has refused to do so for the last 3 years you wonder why it is we cant come together on funding priorities for 3 years the senate has said were not going to tell you what were interested in doing were not going to provide you with any ideas and because we wont move it the house product cant move and the president doesnt have anything to work with so you see the kind of economic turmoil that were in today but the president to his credit has submitted a budget each and every year with his priorities this is the budget that he submitted for 2012 this was just last february the law required it and he complied with it but hes running for reelection he has got his fingers on the pulse of the american people for what they need and what they desire and what they want from the united states governmentagain all attuned towards the election in novemberbut the budget that he submitted raises taxes as the gentleman from virginia advocated by 2 trillion on the american people now if you want to know how much a trillion is i speak to a lot of school groups back home and we try to break those zeros into things that matter if you began on the day that jesus christ was born and if you wasted 1 million a day 7 days a week from the day jesus christ was born through today you would have to throw away 1 million a day every day 7 days a week for another 734 years to throw away your first 1 trillionyour first the president proposes to raise taxes on the american people by 2 trillion folks say rob we have debts we have bills to pay we may have to raise taxes to do it they say he raises taxes by 2 trillion but raises spending by even more thats what were talking about here here is the chart of the promises weve already made the unsustainable path of spending that we have already committed to as a nation it is spending that has to be reduced it is spending that has to be cut they are priorities that have to be reset and reorganized the president in his budget this year said not only are we going to spend all of that but were going to spend 2 trillion more such that were going to tax the american people an additional 2 trillion but were going to raise the debt faster than if we hadnt passed a budget at all there are 2 trillion new dollars coming into the treasury but so much more new spending going out the door that the debt actually rises faster under the presidents plan for 2013 and 14 and 15 and 16 it rises faster under the presidents plan in 2017 and 18 and 19 and 20 you have to go all the way out to 2021 i blew it up here on the chart because i know folks wont be able to see it back in their offices here is 2021 which is represented by this sliver of green way out there at the end of this chart it says if we agree to the presidents budget and if we raise taxes by 2 trillion on the american peoplewith all of this new spending that he would like to do as well way out in 2021well borrow just a little bit less money than if wed done nothing at all i say that because folks arent here bickering over nothing folks are up here advocating at the top of their lungs for their vision of america its the greatest experiment in the history of the world where people would govern themselves a republic as never before seen in world history we started that republic here we are maintaining that republic here i would tell you we are dutybound to pass that republic on not just to our children and to our grandchildren but for generations to come but we have come to a nexus in our history where we disagree on who we are as a people the presidentincredibly effective incredibly talented in running for reelection in trying to enunciate those hopes and dreams that the american people will respond to and endorse and reelect him based onbelieves and advocates even with this crushing burden of debt which every single economist agrees is unsustainable going into the future that over the next 10 years we do not one thing about it in fact we raise taxes by 2 trillion we exacerbate it and we make it worse thats not who this house is thats not why you and i ran for congress thats not why folks left their families thats not why folks got off the sidelines and said ive got to stay at home and complain about it or i can run for congress and do something about it we elected 99 new members in this house last fall99 new members republicans and democrats coming from all walks of lifeto say that we can do better that we can be a part of the solution we dont have to point the finger of blame we can actually put forward solutionsand we have again you dont read that in the newspaper its no wonder folks are so disgusted with what happens in this town because when you read about whats happening in this town its pretty disgusting i want to talk about some of the good news i have four bars here fiscal year 2010 federal government discretionary spending fiscal year 2011 fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013 this fiscal year 2010 that was money that was spent before you and i came to congress that was money that was spent while my republican colleagues were in the minority while we had democrats running the white house and the unitedstates house and the unitedstates senate there was oneparty control we had oneparty republican control from 2000 to 2006 we had oneparty democratic control from 2008 to 2010 spending levels discretionary spendingfolks say rob doesnt all spending begin in the house no it does not for the most part twothirds of the budget is comprised of mandatory spending spending that does not come through the house each and every year but discretionary spending comes through the house this 1 27 trillion comes through the house for us to make a decision on each and every year you know the story the decisions weve been making when you and i arrived we joined our senior republican colleagues here we created a new republican majority here in this house for fy 2011 the first year in which you and i served we reduced spending im not talking about washington d c funny math im not talking about where you raise spending by 10 and call it a cut im talking about actual unitedstates dollars going out the door in discretionary spending when we came into this congress and we took on fy 2011 appropriations we reduced it from 1 27 trillion to 1 21 trillion 64 billion lessnot inflation adjusted actual dollars 64 billion less in 2011 than in 2012 you say rob thats not enough youre absolutely right its not enough we only have a small amount of control over the budget here were going to do what we can when we can we went on to 2012 reduced it again down to 1 18 trillion thats another 31 billion reduction and 31 billion is not enough no of course its not enough is the history in the country that we raise it and raise it and raise it yes it is have we changed that history for the first time since world war ii madam speaker you better believe it it has not happened in this land since the end of world war ii that a congress year after year after year and now after year reduces the discretionary spending going out the door because it wasnt just that we spent less in 2011 than we spent in 2010 we spent less in 2012 than we spent in 2011 and with the bill that we passed on the floor of this house yesterday we are now on track to spend less in 2013 than we spent in just to be clear we talked so much about what goes on here on the house floor when i show you the path of fiscal despair that is ahead of us with this redline the current path if we do nothing and i show you the green line the solution that we proposed in this house its important to note that the green line is just what weve proposed weve passed it in a bipartisan way weve passed it twice in a bipartisan way but the senate has never taken it up the president has promised he would never implement it it is something that we see as a vision of prosperity for this country but we cannot get agreement from the senate or the white house to implement that idea is distinguished from what weve done with discretionary spending where these bills have passed the house have passed sometimes a kicking and screaming senate and have been signed into law by the president of the united states this is not an aspirational goal that i have here this is the law of the land all the easy choices are gone they were gone before you and i got here they may well have been gone before my colleague from indiana got here the easy choices have all been made already the only thing that is left are the hard choices you know as well as i do when we talk about cutting spending when we talk about reducing the size and scope of the federal government every dollar we spend comes from back home every dollar we spend comes out of the wallets of our constituents back home we get to choose where we want to spend that money as a voter back home i can choose to send it to my city government i can send it to my county government i can send it to my state government i can send it to my federal government but who back home around the water cooler or the coffee pot says golly what we need in this country is efficiency and thrift we want it done really well and really fast and we want it done for the lowest possible price lets see lets send it to washington d c let them do it and i bet theyll get it right who says that nobody says that here we are trying to nationalize the entire health care system in this country in the name of efficiency and lower costs no were not going to get it right i say lets keep it in the hands of the private sector some folks may say give it to our city government some folks may say give it to our county government nobody says lets send it to washington d c so when were making these reductions when were trying to be thrifty with the dollars that we have seized from american taxpayers out of their paychecks each and every month theres not one antigovernment advocate in this town but there are good government advocates in this town whether you sit on the republican side of the aisle or the democratic side of the aisle one thing on which we can all agree is that the federal government has let us down the gentleman from virginia made a passionate case for why it is we need to fund green energy i happen to have the largest manufacturer of highefficiency solar panels in america in my district and i believe in green energy what i dont believe in is crony capitalism thats what we saw in solyndra crony capitalism where the political contributors get the taxpayer dollars where hundreds of millions of dollars can be wasted with no accountability whatsoever thats not good for anyone thats not good for the left thats not good for the right and that is not good for a single american taxpayer were talking about good government here i daresay as i look at this chart to my left of decreasing federal spending actual dollars going down not just for 1 year not just for 2 years but now for 3 years in a row that that would not have happened but for the american people speaking out in the 2010 election and sending 99 new members to this congress we had lots of members here who believe in thrift who believe in efficiency who believe in making sure the taxpayer gets their maximum value out of every tax dollar but there were not enough there were not enough i cant tell you how many times from back home i watched the gentleman from indiana alone as he advocated for good government alone on the floor of the house trying to make a difference the american people sent 99 new faces here new minds new ideas and its made this difference i dont have any idea how the next election is going to turn out but im absolutely certain with every fiber of my being that were going to have the largest voter turnout in american history come november 6 i know this if theres one thing i trust in this country beyond the united states constitution and the king james bible its the american people when more americans turn out in november than ever before to make a decision about who we are as a nation where were going as a nation and who shall lead this nation were going to get it right i dont have any idea which direction thats going to go but i trust the american people newt gingrich said it best when he was down in georgia speaking during the presidential campaign he said this year we do not need a presidential candidate we can believe in we need candidates who believe in us its one of the distinguishing features on the floor of this house do you believe in the american people do you trust the american people do you know in your heart that the american people left to their own devices will get it right every time or do you believe they just cant handle it and its up to washington d c to solve those issues for them were going to find out on november 6 where the hearts and minds of the american people are but you see on these charts behind us the kind of success that we can have as a nation as a people in turning the good ship america when the american people turn out to the polls and send back to washington those folks who care more about the future of this country than they care about themselves with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0009572601993568242, 0.0009572601993568242, 0, "i rise today in support of house resolution 419 the rule provides for consideration of two separate but related bills h r 2250 the epa regulatory relief act of 2011 and h r 2681 the cement sector regulatory relief act of 2011 im proud to sponsor this rule which provides for a modified open amendment process with a preprinting requirement this modified open rule means that any member republican or democrat with any germane amendment that complies with the other rules of the house will have the opportunity to debate that issue its another example of the republican majoritys continued commitment to openness and transparency since coming to this body back in january my priority has been to create an environment where american workers can prosper in my home district unemployment hovers around 13 percent i dont doubt this sad statistic is part of the reason why vice president biden is in my district today talking up the presidents socalled american jobs act unfortunately for thousands of people looking for work in floridas fifth congressional district they cant afford for the president and vice president to just keep talking about it they need action not promises they need to actually break down the barriers that are preventing job creators and employers from creating new jobs every week when i go home i meet with small business owners to get their input on what they need to start hiring again they always tell me the same three things we need demand from customers loans arent as easy to come by as they were prior to the recession and they have no idea what to expect from washington as it relates to regulation and taxes washington cant directly control the first two things but can absolutely take care of the third when we had a balanced budget amendment rally in dade city one of the small business owners stood up and said what we need is certainty from the federal government we need certainty what our taxes are going to be and what regulations are going to be he talked about the fact that regulations change on a moments notice based upon whims of the government he used to plan 3 to 5 years out in regards to what their business plan was going to do what their hiring process was going to be today theyre lucky if they can plan 90 days based upon the uncertainty and so long as twothirds of americans in this country think that were on the wrong track theyre going to stay hunkered down waiting for signs that things are improving the american people need to believe that were putting this economy back on track back towards growth and prosperity and you do that through leadership there are currently 219 regulations under consideration each of those regulations separately will cost us 100 million thats 21 9 billion in increased regulations on businesses today that are already crushed because they cant compete whats more there are 4 226 new regulations in the hopper with that many regulations costing that much money hanging over their heads how on earth can we expect small businesses to actually create jobs today in the house we have the ability to address some of these executive rules all promulgated by the epa those rules collectively known as boiler mact and cement mact put thousands of jobs in my district in jeopardy for the life of me i cant understand how the vice president can stand up in front of the citizens of land 0 lakes florida talking about job creation with a straight face when the obama administration is actively pursuing regulations like boiler mact and cement mact in my district alone the cement mact rule could cost up to 200 cement manufacturing jobs not adding into the total of jobs that are going to be lost on the associated industries that move it sell it and use it additionally numerous groups and industries have made it clear that boiler mact regulations will cost them hundreds of millions of dollars and will put many of their employees in the unemployment line and yet our president ignores these regulations and keeps talking about doubling down with a second stimulus following the failed first stimulus package well here we are today doing something to actually save jobs not just talking about it one of the very first actions i took as a member of congress was to invite the epa to come to my office and explain to me their finalized rules in respect to the portland cement manufacturing that goes on in my district they said to me we understand its not without challenge to the industry i may not have been here long but i know washington doublespeak when i hear well its not without additional challenges to that industry its not just the cement mact rule thats not without challenge my colleague mr hastings wrote a letter to the epa about 2 months ago and i commend him for this letter in it he says the boiler mact rule alone could impose tens of billions of dollars in capital costs at thousands of facilities across the country my colleague from florida asked the epa to consider a more flexible approach that could prevent severe job losses and billions of dollars in unnecessary regulatory costs in florida alone boiler mact will affect at least 43 boilers requiring 530 million in retrofits i just heard from the florida sugar industry who estimates boiler mact for their compliance alone will cost 350 million and cost untold jobs ive heard from the pulp and paper workers who may need to lay off 87 000 workers if the boiler mact regulations go into place ive heard from timber producers in my district that have recently been hurt because unitedstates plywood producers have had to close because of lack of demand and now theyre fearful they may have to deal with the double whammy that boiler mact is going to do in regards to putting businesses out of work and close them down it could crush one of the last outlets for their timber products representative hastings in his letter to the epa said this i believe that regulations can be crafted in a balanced way that sustains both the environment and jobs i believe these bills h r 2250 and h r 2681 meet that balance and makes that balancing possible these bills dont completely eliminate clean air emissions regulations for boilers incinerators or cement kilns but what they do is require the agency to create regulations that actually take achievable science into account they give the affected industry time to comply in sum they make the epa think about the american workforce and in an environment where job creation is key i dont see how we cant support that with that i encourage my colleagues to vote yes on the rule and i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0010210234904661775, 0.0010210234904661775, 0, "i thank the gentleman from arkansas i appreciate his leadership and his friendship and his service to our great state the great state of arkansas i am thrilled that were having the conversation that were having here late in the day regarding these types of issues that in my strongest opinion are impacting our ability to create jobs and thats the prize that we all keep our eye on here in these chambers is what can we do to strengthen our capacity to put people back to work because i think at the end of the day thats exactly what people elected us to do last november is to come up here and change this climate change this culture and put the entrepreneur back in charge because thats where job creation comes from a couple of points before i go to some notes that i brought specifically for this afternoons presentation and that is that this cloud of uncertainty that continues to hover over the economy of the united states of america is influenced by a number of things but let me just take two or three of them the threat of higher taxes and not just the threat of higher taxes but the relationship of the threat of higher taxes to the issues of the deficit and the debt i made these comments not too long ago on this very floor that in private business in business in general your debt is usually tied to your assets the assets of the company most businesspeople get that but in government your debt is tied to your capacity to increase taxes so this debt and deficit issue that we continue to struggle with as a country and the prospect of that debt continuing to riseand not too long from now were going to have a vote on increasing the statutory limit on debtinfluences i think contributes to this cloud of uncertainty that leads a prospective entrepreneur a prospective job creator to not do what that person would like to do even with trillions of dollars sitting on the balance sheets of corporate america the hesitancy to create these jobs influenced by the threat of higher taxes and then i think also fundamental to this cloud of uncertainty as i call it continuous overregulation by this government that the prospective job creator cannot compute the input costs associated with more government regulation notice i havent even mentioned the impact of the health care law obamacare as we call it its hard to compute the input costs of this health care law and then more recently the threat of higher energy prices and a flawed if not almost nonexistent energy policy of this administration just think about it youre a prospective job creator youve got an idea youre a creative person you want to live the american dream but standing in your way between your dream and your capacity to do something creatively and resourcefully to put people to work to contribute to society are things like higher taxes more government regulation and red tape the impact of when i hire these people the impact of obamacare and then on top of all of that the price at the pump and higher energy prices i just dont see why the other side cannot understand why were not creating jobs why we continue to hover at the 9 percent level on unemployment just a couple of weeks ago we passed on this floor a budget for 2012 and in that budget immediately before the ink was dry we were being criticized because of what we were trying to do and what i believe is the reasonable approach to solving our nations fiscal problems and that is finally delving into something that nobody ever wanted to touch and thats the entitlement programs the mandatory spending side of the house where most of the money is i just want to make a couple of these comments as it concerns medicare because i heard back from my constituents a teletown hall meeting the other night the first phone call i got from bella vista arkansas was a gentleman worried because he had heard that we were attempting to take his medicare away in 1965 when that program was created baby boomers were teenagers and now 10 000 baby boomers a day enter qualification for medicare when medicare was created in 1965 the life expectancy of a human being was around 70 a little younger today its close to 80 years of age medicare spending is growing at an unsustainable rate of 7 2 percent every year seniors are already facing access issues think about this under the current system one in three primary doctors are limiting medicare patients one in eight are forced to deny medicare patients altogether if the medicare program is allowed to continue without any change at all the congressional budget office projects it goes bankrupt in 9 years basically if we allow medicare to maintain the status quo medicare collapses so were leading our conference is leading were taking mandatory spending and entitlement programs and were deciding that were going to throw our cards down on the table were going to do something about it the plan that we voted to approve just a couple of weeks ago preserves protects medicare for those 55 and over not just those drawing medicare but those nearing retirement people that have planned their lives around that program we dont change that for those people that needs to be said it needs to be repeated over and over again but again we get demagogued about it because at the surface level it sounds like were trying to just take it away let me repeat again those 55 and older not affected by the proposed reforms that we support starting in 2022 new medicare beneficiaries would be enrolled in the same kind of health care program that i have that my colleague from arkansas has and my other colleagues who have spoken here tonight future medicare recipients would be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options and theyd be given the ability to choose a plan that works best for them its not a voucher system its premium support no money changes hands between the government and the individual its modeled after what members of congress and federal employees already have the reforms are designed to decrease the fraud within the system and requires congressional oversight by requiring transparent pricing and minimum benefit and quality standards and instituting more competitive forces my friends thats what the free enterprise system is about and i believe if it has worked for 235 years of this great country it should be also the way forward let me finish by saying this like my colleague from arkansas he and i came in as freshmen together on january 5 in these hallowed chambers we didnt come here to do nothing we didnt come here to kick the old can down the road to ignore the facts we came here to act with dispatch and make a difference for our country thats why im pleased to join my colleagues here of our great freshman class in providing this information to the american public its not only what we were elected to do it is our moral duty to do it and to do it as soon as we can and to do it with the sense of purpose that i think defines the 112th congress"], [0.0010362863540649414, 0.9989637136459351, 1, "it was wonderful to have you here a close friend a close colleague of john paytons to give us a more indepth history not only of his accomplishments but of the man himself and we thank you for joining us as yourself a very strong fighter for justice and equality a legal scholar like john payton who has also devoted her life like he did to justice and equality i want to just close by saying a few words myself about john payton and the work that we still have yet to do it was at the retreat of the congressional black caucus foundation even as we were remembering eulogizing and coming to terms with the loss of our chairman and colleague and friend don payne that we learned of johns passing it was distressing and disconcerting to think that at this time when we need strong fighters for equality and justice more than ever that not only donald payne but now john payton would also be taken away from us but we are blessed that we have their legacies the bodies of their work and contributions and that standing on them and their inspiration we can be strengthened to continue the fight that they led so well later than many of my colleagues i first came to know john payton personally in 2003 when he was at the firm of what was then wilmer cutler and pickering now known as wilmer hale at that time as you heard he was the lead counsel for the 2003 university of michigan affirmative action cases in the end the supreme court upheld the law schools affirmative action policy in a related case but i also came to know john payton and his wife gay mcdougall as you heard at the conference that i attended with congresswoman barbara lee a u n conference in geneva on voter participation which barbara was the director of that conference but johns work in civil rights as you heard began from his undergraduate time at pomona college and continued when at harvard law school he worked with students injured in the race riotsrelated violence during the boston schoolbusing controversy many students at the law schools at harvard howard and georgetown where he was a visiting professor at various times were fortunate to have the benefit of his experience and his expertise he was active in many domestic and international causes along with his wife and international human rights lawyer gay mcdougall he was one of the international monitors in south africa in the very first election in which south african blacks could vote at the time nelson mandela was elected president the legal defense fund said of him that he was a guiding light a brilliant advocate a mentor and a teacher who believed that american democracy thrives when it embraces all of our voices president barack obama called him a true champion of equality and said that he helped to protect civil rights in the classroom and at the ballot box so as we honor john payton and his legacy we recommit ourselves to continue his and our fight for justice last week i participated in the 2012 national environmental justice conference and training program where administration officials researchers and advocates from all over the country convened here in washington d c it was distressing to hear of the communities in this country which today are suffering health impacts and still in 2012 have to fight to be free of polluting industries and for clean air and water these persistent environmental injustices cry out for justice the case of 17yearold trayvon martin who was killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer as he trayvon walked home has not only aroused sympathy for the family but justified anger over his senseless killing it has also revived the long and shameful history of racial profiling in this country and our flagrant and reckless use of guns and the gun culture which so many people promote here trayvons death is tragic in and of itself but its sadly a story that has been and continues to be told in countless communities across our nation our children and our families cry out for justice the wealth gap continues to widen dangerously in this country according to the pew foundation the wealth of white families here is 20 times that of african americans and 18 times that of latinos the health policy institute of the joint center for political and economic studies has issued several recent reports that showed how poverty including extreme poverty and persistent segregation create health education economic and other disparities to quote angus deaton of princeton university in a recent paper there are grounds to be concerned about the rapid expansion in inequality at the very top of the income distribution in the united states this is not only an injustice in itself but it poses a risk of spawning injustices in education in health and in governance the increasing income inequality in this country also cries out for justice i could go on but let me just end with health every year there are over 80 000 excess deaths in people of color deaths that could and should and must be prevented every minority group suffers some health disparity african americans and american indians and alaskan natives more than most many of these deaths and the countless disproportionate disabilities could be prevented with the continued implementation of the affordable care act it is health injustice that dr martin luther king jr called the most shocking and inhumane the countless and seemingly endless years of these tragic health iniquities and the millions of people who have suffered because of them also cry out for justice it is for ending these and other injustices that john payton dedicated his life in an article in the civil rights monitor he said the problems of race and inequality in our country have proven to be enduring and deepseated in nature but we must recognize that this is a marathon and not a race if we are to find solutions that work we are grateful for the leg of the marathon that he ran and the progress that he made in this race while he was with us to his wife gay his sisters janette oliver and susan grissom his brother glen spears the naacp legal defense fund and his many colleagues and friends i join my cbc colleagues in offering our

doesnt have any criminals in it is you sent them all to the texas state penitentiary when you were judge but i think this event that has occurred should tell us a lot of things one that the country of iran is so bold they believe that they can commit a crime of terror on the soil of the united states and get away with it that the united states wouldnt do anything or there wouldnt be any consequences whatever but the government and i believe the government of iran was in the middle of this was so arrogant to hurt and kill americans that they were willing to do this on our homeland i think that we have the responsibility to treat this just like it had actually occurred had they carried out the assault on the embassy here killed the ambassador at a restaurant apparently killed the israeli ambassador killed the two ambassadors of the same countries in argentina which was discussed we should be very concerned about that and not give it a pass because our law enforcement did a good job but also theyre willing to recruit the zeta cartel to bring explosives into the united states i wonder whether this is the first time they thought they were dealing with the zeta cartels we dont know but the zetas to me are the worst of the worst drug cartels it reminds me of the old show on television back years ago paladin where his business card read have gunwill travel and thats what the zetas are theyve got guns and theyll travel anywhere to assassinate people to make a little money so youve got iran on one side of the world and the drug cartels in mexico two criminal enterprises working togetherone for political reasons one for money reasonsto cause harm to the united states now that brings us to a question of the real problem which is the border the unitedstates border with mexico and its porousness is a national security issue it is not an immigration issue that is a completely different issue its a border security national security issue last year from the i believe the same report that you have provided there were 663 individuals from special interest countries that were captured by our law enforcement now special interest countries are countries where terror organizations originatesaudi arabia pakistan sri lanka and afghanistan thats where these 663 people were from that were captured by our law enforcement trying to come into the united states and they werent coming in here looking for work that americans wont do they were coming over here for mischief reasons and thats because the border is open the world knows if you can get to mexico you can get to the united states and that was the plan in this bold endeavor to commit terror in the united states recently we did a border forum in brownsville where we had primarily law enforcement and people who lived on the border testified about violence on the border there are some places on the border that arent violent on the united states side but there are other places that are its not all peaceful and its not all violent it depends on the area of the border one of the cattlemen that is a ranger for the cattlemens association testified that he was so concerned about crossborder travel and crime coming into the united states on ranches and nothing was being done about the crime that was being committed on these ranches by people crossing into the united states primarily drug cartels that the cattlemen since they dont feel protected may end up taking the law into their own hands and we dont want to get into that situation you mentioned trafficking human trafficking thats another tremendous problem that the united states needs to be aware of that young people young women and girls from all over the world are being smuggled to mexico then smuggled into the united states and then trafficked throughout the united states for sexual crimes and its an awful awful scourge but they cross the border because its open in so many places in our judiciary committee a couple weeks ago we had testimony that the number one threat to national security of the united states is not al qaeda but the criminal drug cartels that operate in mexico the number one national security threat is the criminal drug cartels that operate in mexico that should give us really a warning that we really do have a tremendous crisis on our hands because those people are at war not only with mexico but theyre at war with the united states lastly i wanted to point out that there are several things that are being done but the problem still existspeople are crossing into the united states border patrol is doing the best they can of course local law enforcement the sheriffs are doing as good a job as they can and they mentioned the problem that you have talked about about how the drug cartels want to infiltrate this side of the border and actually control regions its pretty simple what they do they own land on one side of the rio grande river in mexico and they want to buy or steal or confiscate land on the texas side of the rio grande river that way they can move their drugs and smuggling operation from one land they own to another land they own across the river and when we get in that situation where the drug cartels are owning land on both sides of the border weve got ourselves a real problem and its not just drugs its this problem right here it seems to me that we need more people to protect the security of the united states thats one of the things the federal government is actually supposed to do is to protect us and one piece of legislation ive offered is to put the national guard on the border not behind the border but on the border 10 000 troops at the request of the governors supervised by the governors paid by the federal government but put them on the border right now our policy seems to be since we cant have enough people on the border we have them behind the border and we try to catch them if you can thats people coming into the united states everybody the good the bad and the ugly and once we catch them they become our problem our financial problem and then we have to deal with them and try to send as many as we can back if we have the national guard on the border theyre not going to cross into the united states if we have that presence and i think its come to that where we actually need to do that and talk about the role of the federal government is national security with that i thank my friend for yielding"], [0.0011120438575744629, 0.9988879561424255, 1, "this month is filipino american history month it is time for us to take

together on a streetcar finally he proposed they were married in 1936 and they had three children whom the world pretty much knowsmarlo tony and terre when rose marie was about to give birth to their first child marlo danny thomas was torn between his dedication to work and his responsibilities to his wife and his newborn daughter desperately he sought relief in prayer he knelt before the statue of st jude the patron saint of hopeless causes and begged for a sign should he or should he not remain in show business he promised that if st jude showed him the way he would erect a shrine in his honor danny went on to become one of the best loved entertainers of his era starring in many tv shows and movies from 53 to 64 he received five emmy nominations for a starring role in make room for daddy winning best actor starring in a regular series in 53 and 54 the show also received an emmy for best new situation comedy in 53 and best situation comedy in 54 he also produced comedy programs the dick van dyke show the andy griffith show the real mccoys and the mod squad yet he never forgot his promise to build a shrine to st jude he had conversations with his close friend and mentor a native of tennessee and archbishop of chicago cardinal samuel stritch cardinal stritch was the cardinal in toledo when danny thomas was in church and they became close cardinal stritch who served time in memphis at st patricks church after he was in nashville which was his home told danny that the shrine to st jude should be a hospital where children should be cared for regardless of race religion or ability to pay he told him that the hospital should be in memphis tennessee cardinal stritch was a great man for many many reasons but this was one of themthe creation of the st jude childrens research hospital with danny thomas the hospital located in memphis is one of the worlds premier centers for research and treatment of pediatric cancer and for other catastrophic childrens diseases it is the first and only pediatric cancer center to be designated as a comprehensive cancer center by the national cancer institute children throughout the united states and from around the world come to

sisters of divine providence originally a college for religious sisters it now educates a diverse group of students from around the world offering highquality educational opportunities that continue to reflect its catholic heritage soon after its founding la roche experienced financial difficulties that threatened the schools existence due to the financial strain the congregation at that time seriously considered permanently closing the college however because of the profound and positive impact the school made on the community in the short time its doors had been opened the students state officials and the community leaders urged the congregation and the schools leadership to continue the mission of the school and to keep the school open thankfully due to the outpouring of support from the community in 1970 the board amended its charter to establish la roche college as an independent coeducational catholic institution which it remains today it also joined with the art institute of pittsburgh and diversified its course offerings expanding the areas of study the college would offer including graphic and interior design programs that are among la roche colleges most popular programs today i was proud to serve on the board of trustees at la roche college it was during my time as a trustee that i had the wonderful opportunity to get to know the late monsignor william kerr who served as la roches president for 12 years it was during his tenure that the college established the pacem in terris institute a scholarship program for outstanding collegeage men and women from conflict and postconflict nations such as rwanda and bosnia the institute allows students to receive an education at la roche college to study leadership and diplomacy in return for their agreement to return to their home country after graduation to help engage in the peace process and rebuild their nations the institute successfully reflects the colleges vision and mission to foster global citizenship that program over the years has created a bond with some countries that is unlike any other institution of higher learning in america it has had students go through the program that have gone back to their home countries and have very successfully become leaders in those countries we are better off as a nation and as a global community because of their work and because of that program which initiated and continues at la roche college it was also during my time on the board of trustees in 2004 that la roche college board of trustees appointed sister candace introcaso as the colleges seventh president sister candace began her career in education at la roche in the late 1980s and its under her leadership that the college has continued to expand its global footprint while placing a renewed focus on serving the needs of those in the pittsburgh region i had the privilege of working closely with sister candace during my time as a trustee and as the congressman who now represents la roche college the future is bright for the college under her continued leadership la roche college improves upon itself year after year it continues to expand its academic offerings with more than 50

congressman you made it look fun folks were always saying thank you thank you thank you for all the spending that was going on here i said i dont get to make any fun decisions when youve increased the public debt in this country by 50 percent over the last 4 years youre all out of giveaway decisions all we have now are tough decisions thats all we have and again i know that my friend from massachusetts speaks with passion and conviction his advocacy for the neediest among us is an inspiration on the floor and in committee and on and on and i dont fault him for that a bit but i would say to my friend had we not given that payroll tax cut to members of congress we could have provided that food stamp increase that you discussed earlier to an additional 2 million individuals in this country an additional 2 million individuals in this country had we foregone that tax increase right here but we didnt we chose just to go along with the program and cut away spend away we cant do that weve got to stop that and i would say to my friend because its hard i have the same families struggling in my district that you do in fact our foreclosure rate in my district is higher than it is in your district our number of folks who are going homeless in georgia as a result of foreclosures higher than it is in massachusetts but when you talk about the additional 1 8 million folks 1 8 million folks according to the cbo who are going to lose their food stamp benefits under this bill theres no question about that but heres the thing and this is important this bill doesnt cut anybody from food stamps this bill says the only people who can get food stamps are people who apply and qualify for food stamps hear that the cbo tells us and my friend from massachusetts quotes that 1 8 million people are going to lose food stamp benefits but the only change this bill makes is that you actually have to apply for the benefits to get the benefits so that means 1 8 million people in this country are receiving food stamp benefits who would not qualify for food stamp benefits if they had to go and apply that is not meanspirited if you want to change the food stamp rules if you want to make it a laxer process whatever you want to do lets do that but lets not demonize each other lets not say were trying to throw poor children out in the streets when all were saying is we have a successful food stamp program and why dont we just limit it to those people who qualify for it"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0004191398620605469, 0.49958086013793945, 0, "when you said many years you are my
