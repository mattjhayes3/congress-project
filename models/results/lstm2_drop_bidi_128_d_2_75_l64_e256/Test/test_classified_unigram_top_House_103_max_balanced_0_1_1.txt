struck successfully bid to purchase the division similar longterm strikes have occurred in connecticut but this particular strike was the longest in connecticuts history and needless to say it was

happier and more productive workplace for that reason i believe that business owners are wise to provide employees with leave either paid or unpaid for the birth or adoption of a child or when there is some other critical family need such as a serious injury or illness what is a good business practice however does not necessarily make a good legislative proposal and that is the case with h r 1 the family and medical leave act of 1993 although its intention is a good one this act should it become law could actually have a detrimental effect on many wordng amedcansparticularly during this period of high unemployment and marginal business profitability many employers who already provide an attractive combination of benefits for their employees may find that this additional required benefit will simply be more than they can afford and because the act applies only to companies with more than 50 fulltime employees some employers may be inclined to reduce their work forces so that they will fall under the provisions of the legislation rather than be forced out of business altogether they may simply move some employees to part time status and lay off others another argument we hear concerning this and other similar legislation is that businesses have a social responsibility to factor in the social and environmental costs of doing buslness to some extent i agree with this viewpoint however we need to keep in mind the lessons of those socialist countries such as the former unitedstatess r and other eastern european nations which had comprehensive social welfare and environmental laws the result of these laws was that people had fewer real benefits and the condition of their environment was disastrous the simple fact is that family leave is a good business policyfor most businesses however most families that live paycheck to paycheck could not afford to take unpaid leave if offered a much better solution to the problem has been proposed by

one that particularly bothers me if i understand this correctly currently if a highway is put through a community the persons who give up their homes for the highway construction are compensated that is a taking and they are reimbursed hopefully adequately but the people who used to look at homes and are now looking at highway are not currently compensated under our system and it would bankrupt the whole transportation system but under the gentlemans amendment as i read it the local governments would be required to set up a procedure to compensate those whose view had been altered and i

gentleman will yield i want to underscore four points that i believe you made and i think are worthy of some repetition because it goes to the facts of the relationship between the mexican and the united states economies rather than the fears that people have the first point is that mexican wages have been rising steadily since 19871988 as yodi pointed out the mexican economy was inflicted with chronic inflation which in 1988 was 150 percent a year through concerted action with the government and labor unions that inflation rate was brought down to under 5 percent during that period from 1988 to 1902 mexican wages went up 135 percent in real terms they increased 19 3 percent so it is not true that the statistics you are hearing about low mexican wages or the rate of growth of mexican wages if you take in the period that included the oil boom and the hyperinflation but if you look over the past 5 years since the economic reforms mexican wage rates are higher than has been stated they are increasing they will be increasingly linked with productivity according to the proclamation by president salinas so the wage differential is not as has been portrayed second is actually mexican wage rates increasing is a tremendous benefit for the united states it helps create a mexican middle class which today is larger than the entire population of canada we already know that mexican citizens are tremendous customers of united states goods on a per capita basis they buy far more than japanese citizens do even though the japanese have far more income they are tremendous customers it is a rapidly growing market and it is one that we can get preferential access to through nafta the third point i think was mentioned by the gentleman when he talked about the plant moving back to the united states a lot of the opponents of nafta are talking about wage costs as if those were the only thing that mattered in making a business decision it is not it is total costs and total costs of production include the infrastructure the productivity of the workers it includes proximity to market the transportation costs all those things work in the gentleman from new hampshire spoke earlier about how labor costs were actually a relatively small percentage and in fact for many products are exceeded by the transportation costs or in this country perhaps by the cost of health care there are many other factors that go in this other than just wage rates if wage rates determined all those declaons then extremely low wage countries like haiti bangladesh and burkina faso would be our true economic competition they are not our competition are higher wage countries if wage rates were everything then bmw and mercedes would have chosen to locate their new plants in mexico and not in the united states the last point that i wish to emphasie from what the gentleman said is that our wellbeing as a country is going to become increasingly linked to the countries to our south our economic growth will be increasingly derived from exports latin america is our natural market it is the market where we have a natural advantage and nafta begins the process of giving us a preferential advantage in that market ahead of our greatest competitors the japanese and the western europeans but even more so our fight against drugs depends upon stable governments in latin america our immigration problems in large part are caused by the fact that the economies of those countries have not been able to keep pace with the demands of their population as those economies grow the governments become more stable they will be able to assist us to a greater extent on those issues the final point is with the environment there are environmental problems along the border but i just do not see how we deal with those in the absence of nafta in the absence of a mexico that is economically strong enough to start dealing with the environment and should nafta be defeated i do not see any mechanism out there that those problems will finally be addressed either on the united states side or the mexican side there are so many reasons why the freetrade agreement is a good deal for the united states but i think you have hit on so many of them that the reasons a lot of the opponents give for fearing the agreement actually when you look at them and you look at them in the way our
