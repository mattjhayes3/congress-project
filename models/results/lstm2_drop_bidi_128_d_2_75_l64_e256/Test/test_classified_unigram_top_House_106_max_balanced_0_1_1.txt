rising to these great challenges they became giants of their era just as i measure each day what i achieve against what my parents achieved in their era their children will measure themselves against

regions has been raised at the expense of northeast veterans the situation continues to get worse not better for the 150 000 veterans in maine veterans in my district rely on togus va hospital in

and yet visn 1 is one of only two visns that has lost funding since 1996 when vera was implemented while the quality of medical care remains high budget constraints have forced togus to reduce staff causing severe strains on access to cae as well as staff morale the excessive waiting time makes it difficult to enroll new patients because funding increases through vera are tied to the number of patients seen veterans in the northeast regions are put at an automatic disadvantage i am told over and over by the va undersecretary for health dr thomas garthwaite that the vera numbers work out i am told that each visn receives the appropriate amount of money to cover its costs the numbers are not working out the former acting director of visn 1 recently said that over the past few years equipment and construction funds were used to supplement funds for direct medical care vera simply does not provide the means to cover the facility costs of hospitals in the northeast and still

recent years we are still not doing enough to make sure that children get the right immunizations when they need them as this chart shows in some states like my home state of texas michigan and nevada one in four children are not receiving one or more of the immunizations they need by the time they are 2 years old in houston we share seven members of congress in houston and that is my district over 44 percent of our children do not receive one or more of the immunizations over 44 percent of the children receive less than one or more of their immunizations i am introducing two bills that will help correct this situation the first is the sense of congress that calls for increase in funding to crucial state immunization infrastructure programs the second bill the comprehensive insurance coverage of childhood immunization act will require health plans to begin providing immunizations to children as a covered benefit americas children need our help in recent months some have questioned why vaccines are needed at all some have linked them to adverse effects such as autism while there is no scientific link between immunizations and autism and i will repeat no scientific link between immunization and autism i support efforts to completely and thoroughly research this issue to put the minds of parents at rest we should not lose our focus however on the huge health gains that have resulted from immunizations the centers for disease control list vaccinations for children as the number one public health achievement of the last century before we had the smallpox vaccine 48 000 americans per year had this disease 1 528 died before we had a measles vaccine close to onehalf million children a year got this disease and over 400 died before we had the mumps vaccine close to 150 000 died each year of this disease before we had diphtheria vaccination over 175 000 children got sick each year none of these diseases have been eliminated only smallpox has been eradicated an epidemic of unvaccinated children is entirely possible as we saw with measles in 1989 children still die of the measles mumps rubella and whooping cough these are dangerous and harmful painful and sometimes fatal diseases measles can lead to seizures and death mumps can lead to deafness polio causes paralysis that can lead to permanent disability and death diphtheria can result in coma and death whooping cough can result in death for infants providing access to lifesaving vaccines should be one of our nations top priorities tracking children who have not been vaccinated in order to prevent future outbreaks should be another priority to meet these goals the sense of congress resolution i have introduced with my friend and colleague the gentleman from pennsylvania calls for an increase in federal funds to the public health services section 317 infrastructure program a similar resolution was approved by the senate budget committee in march these funds are used by states and cities to support a complex array of programs and activities including implementation of registries community outreach management of vaccines quality assurance services and surveillance and outbreak control as this chart of funds illustrates infrastructure funds have reduced rather dramatically in the last 5 years from 271 million in 1995 to 139 million today that is a 40 percent decrease in funds for infrastructure immunization yet the need for outreach and registry and infrastructure development is greater today than it was in 1995 if you have not heard from your state health director on this issue you will cuts in infrastructure funding have meant different things in different states in florida for example the state reports that it has reduced surveys on pockets of need and has reduced monitoring due to lack of adequate staffing the state has reduced community outreach staffs and reduced the number of reminder cards it sends florida has also reduced its schoolbased immunization clinics and has had to cut back on efforts at day care centers in california where infrastructure funds have been reduced from 27 million in 1997 to 14 9 million in 1999 only 35 percent of children have been vaccinated against chicken pox and the state has no system to monitor chicken pox cases in california a targeted immunization information campaign aimed at latino african and american southeast asian families has been eliminated the need for increased infrastructurefunding is particularly important in light of a recent journal of the american medical association showing that 50 percent of americas children are either over or undervaccinated the jama study shows that 21 of toddlers received at least one extra immunization while 31 missed at least one in other words over 50 of american children are receiving too few or too many vaccinations we should do a better job of tracking these children a section 317 funding increase is supported by the american academy of family physicians the american academy of pediatrics and the american public health association the increase is also supported by the association of maternal and child health programs every child by two the association of state and territorial health officials and the association of county and city health officials my second legislative initiative the comprehensive insurance coverage of childhood immunization act of 2000 requires all health plans governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa to provide coverage of immunizations for children 18 years old and younger the vaccines required to be covered are those recommended by cdcs recommended childhood immunization schedule issued periodically by the cdcs advisory committee on immunization practices this schedule is approved by the american academy of pediatrics and others and serves as the standard for immunization in the united states plans may not charge any payment for the immunizations or vaccines and vaccines must be made available to children as soon as they are approved by the advisory committee beginning for plan years in 2001 erisa governed health plans must provide the benefit for plans that are negotiated as part of a collective bargaining agreement the effective date is delayed until plan years following the termination date of the current underlying collective bargaining agreement the adoption of collectively bargained plan amendments made solely in order to comply with the new requirements will not affect the timing of the effective date under this special rule why is federal legislation needed the federal govemment gives this benefit to its own workers it requires plans that contract with the office of personnel management to provide immunizations for children as a covered benefit many states have recognized the importance of covering vaccines twentyfour states including texas have enacted laws to require stateregulated plans to provide vaccines how big is the problem a march 2000 william m mercer survey done for the nonprofit partnership for prevention showed that nearly one in five employersponsored plans do not cover immunizations for infants and children nearly one in four children in preferred provider organizations ppo and indemnity plans do not have coverage for immunizations the comprehensive insurance coverage of childhood immunization act of 2000 is endorsed by the american medical association the american academy of pediatrics and others it and our sense of the congress resolution will improve the health of millions of american children is a costeffective manner for each dollar we spend on vaccines we save twentyfour dollars in future health costs thats a good investment i urge my colleagues to support these two bills and i yield back the

gentleman from massachusetts with regard to the issue of states rights it is not a states rights issue to allow one state court judge to determine the law in 20 or 30 or 40 other states and that is what happens now when nationwide classaction lawsuits with tens or hundreds of thousands of plaintiffs cannot be removed to federal court because of this flaw that has existed in our diversity rules that says that a 75 000 slip and fall involving parties between two states can be removed to federal court but a multimillion dollar or multibillion dollarlawsuit involving tens of thousands of parties cannot be removed to federal court to allow one state court judge in one county in one state to determine the laws of a multitude of other states to allow a judge in the state of alabama to interpret the laws of new york and new jersey and pennsylvania and california and texas is wrong and that is what this bill is designed to do if the gentlemans amendment passes the effect will be to say once the matter is removed to federal court if the federal court does not believe that the legislation constitutes a class action and refuses to certify it as a class action then it would go right back to the state court and they could proceed with their lawsuit just as if nothing had ever happened it would defeat the entire purpose of eliminating forum shopping and it would defeat the entire purpose of making sure that state court judges do not interpret the laws of a multitude of other states the whole purpose is to allow the removal of more interstate class actions to federal courts where they are most appropriately heard this amendment would make that change worthless the amendment would constitute a full endorsement not a correction of the rampant classaction abuse that is occurring in state courts when a federal court denies class certification in a case it is typically because litigating the case on a class basis would likely result in a denial of a class members or a defendants due process rights or basic fairness principles this amendment would invite state courts to overrule such federal court determinations it would invite state courts to advance class actions that a federal court has determined would deny due process rights or be unfair to unnamed class members the amendment is based on the myth that most states have classaction rules radically different from the federal classaction rule and that if a federal judge judges that a class case may not proceed as a class action under the federal rule counsel should be able to take their case back to state court and try their luck under the state rule in reality the vast majority of states have class action rules that track the federal court classaction rule or have held that the federal court precedence should guide state courts in making class certification determinations the problem is that when the rules are largely the same local judges in many states do not rigorously follow these

colleagues within the past 2 years boeings share of the aircraft market has fallen from 70 percent to 50 percent boeing is losing market shares to airbus the european aircraft manufacturer airbus was created in the early 1970s for the sole purpose of maintaining and fostering a european role in the production of large commercial jet aircraft it is a combination of the major aerospace companies of france germany the united kingdom and spain airbus which is 60 percent owned by private companies is not the property of the four european nations however it is still hard to view airbus as a private business just like any other business first of all airbus does not operate as a public corporation but rather it has special legal status under french law this special status allows member companies to pool resources without having to disclose specifics about their combined financial activities therefore airbus remains a financial mystery also france still has not completed the privatization of its aerospace firm aerospatiale given frances long history of substantial support to aerospatiale it is hard to believe that the french government will give up complete control of the company any time soon perhaps most importantly the european commission has the ability to save airbus from bankruptcy if the need ever arises therefore airbus due to its government backing is a company that cannot fail this gives airbus a tremendous advantage because it has the luxury of making its business decisions with very little risk compared to boeing which must defend its business decisions to questioning stockholders not supportive government officials airbus contends that it has earned its increased market share against boeing by simply building the type of aircraft the airline industry wants to buy it is important to note however that airbus success was achieved with significant governmental assistance because airbus does not publish financial statements it is difficult to know exactly how much government support it has received over the course of the years however it is known that the largest amount of financial support was provided in the 1980s when airbus launched major development programs for new aircraft such as the a320 the a330 and the a340 therefore airbus was able to make new and different types of aircraft which helped attract new customers only because of increased direct governmental aid although most of the government aid was in the form of repayable loans it was still a subsidy because it would have cost airbus much more to raise money on the private market it would be nearly impossible for a private company to obtain aircraft development funds at a government borrowing rate it is true that airbus must repay the government aid with interest but only as aircraft are sold therefore there is no risk for airbus when it develops new products because if customers do not buy their new product airbus does not have to repay the loans again airbus due to its government backing is a company that cannot fail it is no wonder that boeing continues to lose market shares to airbus airbus enjoys a tremendous competitive advantage because of the substantial and direct government aid it receives from four european nations airbus is no longer a young company trying to enter the aircraft market it is number two in the market and gaining on boeing each and every day yet airbus still relies on substantial government support this is not right we should not sit idly by as boeing continues to lose out simply because it does not enjoy the same protectionist treatment as airbus"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0002931952476501465, 0.5002931952476501, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me time i rise today in strong support of h r 4864 the

has been you can practice risky behavior as long as you use safe methods to do it so our message has been we are going to reduce the risk and as our message of risk reduction has come about we have the largest incidence of sexually transmitted disease of any society and the largest growth of incurable viral diseases hiv is nothing compared to what is going to happen in this country in terms of chlamydia human papilloma virus and the cancer that is going to be associated with it so the debate really decides how do we care the most the compassion exhibited by wanting to eliminate the transmission is a wonderful compelling argument but it is not enough compassion we have to have enough compassion to eliminate the problem and not enable people to fail as we are enabling our children to fail by our message of safe sex with a condom that does not protect 50 percent of the sexually transmitted disease in this country today so the heart is right the message is wrong if we really want to help these people then we will redouble our efforts to drug treatment centers not enable them to continue to fail the final thing is what happens to somebody when they get hepatitis c in this country and that is the growing epidemic in this country not hiv it is hepatitis c that person does one of two things they either die or they get a liver transplant so if we want to enable this epidemic to continue to flourish then we need to give all of the drug addicts in this country needles because they are sharing the needles anyway and that is what the studies show we are not lessening their longterm health consequences we are in fact enabling them to fail and die of diseases"], [0.0010954737663269043, 0.5010954737663269, 1, "i would like to extend my deep thanks and appreciation to our chairman the gentleman from new mexico our ranking member the gentlewoman from ohio for all of their hard work in crafting this bill it is a tough job to balance the important priorities that the

kosovo i want to say this in the strongest possible terms considering this vote today is so illtimed as to adversely affect the peace negotiations ongoing in the balkans it has taken us so long to build the coalition that we have been able to build in that part of the world and we understand this this congress says they have the obligation to ensure that the diplomats in the region exhaust all possible means in their negotiations like the gentleman from missouri"], [0.0011928081512451172, 0.5011928081512451, 0, "i will reclaim my time that is a silly statement no one in this body endorses fraud for crying out loud i do not even know where that came from what bothers me is it is easy to say oh well the pentagon they spend this much on a weapons system they spend that much on a part these weapons systems are highly sophisticated and it takes awhile they only make one or two parts it is not making 10 000 parts let me go back to my compliment though to the body my compliment to the body is that we have many members in here that have put on the uniform and no one ever asked when we took that oath whether we were republican or democrat so those of us who served in the authorizing committee and the appropriating committees who have the interest on national security keep that dimension now there will always be a critic of a bill for one particular reason or another we have those of whom who are passivists they should take pride in themselves if they are a passivist say they are a passivist do not just pick apart the bill for one reason or another expose your character if they do not i will be more than happy to let me tell you something else that has bothered me when we take an individual who may be a critic of the defense industry or in particular of our defense they are the same individuals of whom are seeking to socialize our military so when they stand up here on the house floor and they talk about well we are having recruiting and retention problems in the military and they give this long laundry list of what is wrong with the military see they are the same ones who endorsed socialization policies of our military socialization policies that in fact then begin to hurt the military a sergeant at fort campbell kentucky came up to me and says congressman if the army gets any more sensitive it is going to cry we have to stop and think what are we doing to the military i have traveled around and i have conducted a lot of hearings being chairman of personnel well many are quick to blame recruiting and retention problems on a good economy easy access to other sources of college funding reduced propensity to enlist a shortage of quality recruits my findings point to other issues that stress the military force it is called lack of spare parts lack of adequate training time aging equipment and high depreciation rates on our equipment socialization policies longer working hours and prolonged family separation due to an increased operational tempo we also have a mismatch in the clinton gore national security strategy between a foreign policy of engagement and enlargement at our national military strategy when we take 265 000plus troops and put them in 135 nations all around the world and then we begin to have them serve as quasidiplomats we then have a workforce out there that begins to then have questioned the mission it is called mission credibility they say i do not mind being separated from my family but to do this and they say then wait a second what happened to the warrior the warriors now have become the humanitarian they are outstretched all over the world as quasidiplomats on all of these humanitarian missions now are some of them noble are some of them worthy yes but we always have to be very careful about what happens when you take a warrior and we then turn him into a humanitarian you dull the warfighting skill when you do that to a division it takes us a year to retrain the division back to the warfighting skill so as i listened to some of the comments of some of the members it is easy to pick apart the bill i believe that this bill is going to receive a large bipartisan support"]]}
