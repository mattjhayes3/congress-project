should america be the only developed nation on the planet that cannot protect its families from gun violence obviously there are no simple solutions in a nation where there is a gun for every adult where a halfdozen people have been killed in recent years by their pets and even babies kill parents and their siblings with guns too many people feel that more guns and fewer protections is the solution obscuring the fact that the overwhelming majority of the american public agrees that there are things we can do and that it is irresponsible and cynical not to try for more than 24 hours last week my democratic colleagues and i discussed many of these solutions on the floor of the house demanding action on three for instance over 90 percent of the american public and a majority of gun owners agreed that there should be no anonymous secret purchases of weapons there should be a universal background check people who cannot buy firearms at a gun store should not be able to buy guns over the internet or at gun shows anonymously the american public supports us in our efforts to make it harder for people the government has deemed too dangerous to buy a plane ticket to purchase assault weapons and it is past time to eliminate the outrageous prohibition against the centers for disease control to even study the epidemic of gun violence that kills three or four americans every hour these solutions are not really that hard they would be a signal that we are serious about trying to change the gun violence equation that kills about 90 people every day i returned to oregon last week and had encouraging meetings with dozens of people who have been leading the charge in my home state who are redoubling their efforts they have demonstrated that steps can be taken through the political process and are committed to building upon their commonsense actions for example they led the charge to prevent people with a history of domestic violence and restraining orders from purchasing guns the oregon legislature finally enacted universal background checks like we are seeking at the federal level and the oregon house of representatives even passed legislation last session that would have closed the socalled charleston loophole where law enforcement has a 10day delay for a purchase if the police are unable to determine that purchasers qualifications i was impressed and encouraged that these ordinary citizens so devoted to this cause are committing to taking on the issue further at the state and local level and making it an issue in the political elections in the fall wherever they can it is only that type of activity that will overcome the inertia the temerity and the cynicism of people who are apologists for gun violence the same way we embarked upon a decadeslong crusade to reduce traffic fatalities that cut that death rate in half we need to embark on a similar crusade to reduce gun violence the members who took to the floor over 24 hours showed a powerful expression of policy and emotion that used to be seen on the floor of this house but is sadly seldom in evidence today but it is not too late congress should do its part to at least allow the issue the attention and the consideration we would give to any other public health crisis and end the shame of being the only developed nation on the planet that cannot protect its families from gun

michigan delegation led by flints representative congressman dan kildee who are fighting every day to bring justice to these families their work is essential to ensuring the people of flint have the resources that they need to recover the situation in flint is nothing short of a tragedy and a tragedy that could have been prevented michigan state officials sacrificed the health and futures of flints children in order to save a few dollars in water costs this really is a shame and a disgrace i have to ask would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where politicians believe the residents are expendable sadly i think we all know the answer to that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals it is clear that the american people need congress to do its job the women in florida who cant leave their homes for fear of

farm bill as a member of the agriculture committee i could not support it either in committee or on the house floor i couldnt support it because it cut snap the supplemental nutrition assistance program our nations premier antihunger program i couldnt support a bill that i believed made hunger worse in america at the time members of both parties offered many assurances that the changes to snaps relationship with liheap the low income home energy assistance program wouldnt hurt snap recipients that the changes were merely closing a loophole rather than a true benefit cut i was skeptical of those assurances at the timeand with good reason the congressional budget office estimated that the change would reduce benefits for about 850 000 lowincome households by an average of 90 a month in the 14 states and the district of columbia that took advantage of a state option to link liheap and snap states chose to use this option to alleviate some of the heartbreaking choices that poor families face seniors and the disabled are all too often the ones forced to choose between buying food or heating their homes or paying for their prescriptions throughout the farm bill process antihunger advocates in the heat and eat states vigorously opposed the liheap cuts to snap saying their effects would be much greater than the congressional budget office estimates im sorry to say they were right these cuts are much more than just abstract numbers we are starting to hear real stories from real people who are seeing their snap benefits cut hunger is worse in this country because of these cuts take judy beals a disabled senior from belleville wisconsin earlier this year she saw her snap benefit cut from 120 a month to 16 a month let me repeat that she now gets 16 a month in food assistance that is it that is unconscionable how could anyone afford to feed themselves for a month on that ms beals says she is forced to eat just once a day now that her snap benefit has been cut as she tries to figure out how to pay her other bills to add insult to injury ms beals found out that her snap benefit had been cut at the register at the grocery store with a full cart of groceries ms beals story is not unique the hunger task force in milwaukee estimates that in wisconsin alone 255 000 families have seen their snap benefits reduced since the liheap cuts went into effect we are hearing similar stories in new jersey another state that did not extend its heat and eat program the food bank of south new jersey estimates that 160 000 new jersey residents have lost about 90 a month in snap benefits due to the farm bill cut now to be fair there are several states including my home state of massachusetts that did the right thing and found a way mostly with state funds to make up the money lost by the liheap cut in the farm bill republican and democratic governors stepped up and recognized that those already struggling to put food on the table would be worse off if they didnt find a way to fix the cut in those states that did not make up the money we will continue to hear stories of people who have seen their snap benefit cut i am proud to serve on the house agriculture committee since the beginning of this congress the committee has been conducting a toptobottom review of the snap program now i have no idea where these hearings are going and once again we have heard assurances that there will be no cuts in snap but i have this sinking feeling in my stomach that these hearings are not leading to a place that is good for millions of struggling americans the fact is snap is a good program it works it is effective and it is efficient it is one of the most efficiently run federal programs that exists with an unbelievably low error rate instead of cutting snap or making other harmful policy changes we should be strengthening the program democratic and republican witnesses alike have testified before the agriculture committee that the snap benefit is already too low we have heard that the certification and recertification process is timeconsuming and onerous especially for working families we have heard about people who are eligible to get renewed benefits who fall off the program because of these onerous new requirements we have heard from charities that they cannot solve the problems of hunger on their own charities do incredible work but they cannot meet the demand for food assistance they need a strong federal partner we need better coordination among all stakeholdersfederal agencies nonprofits faithbased organizations and businessesto end hunger that is why i have been advocating for a white house conference on food nutrition and hunger we need a coordinated holistic plan to end hunger now if we make further cuts to snap we will no doubt hear more stories like ms beals where those who are already struggling to put food on the table see their food assistance benefits cut the bottom line is that we should not be

states who are watching this and reading this issue i wish to discuss is a matter of grave concern to me and i believe to the american people as well i came here 26 years ago prior to my arrival in the united states congress i had served 7 years in the reagan white house i was a speechwriter to president reagan and i was a special assistant to the president which was a designated rank at the white house i recall what it was like in the time leading up to ronald reagans election and i recall specifically how ronald reagan dealt with the great challenges he faced before ronald reagan came to the white house america was in retreat there was a sense of pessimism throughout our country our economy was topsyturvy there were high levels of inflation and high levels of unemployment our country was in jeopardy our country felt a danger because while we were in retreat communismsoviet communismwas on the offensive throughout the world well ronald reagan in 8 short years turned that situation totally around he turned the economy around and he turned around the spirit of the people we went from being pessimistic to being the most optimistic and forwardlooking people in the world yes he helped the economy but foremost ronald reagan ended the cold war i am 67 years old during my life most of us felt that some day we would be at war with the soviet uniona shooting warand that it might take the lives of millions of people we were told to hide under our desk when we were young and cover up our heads in case there was a nuclear attack on our country ronald reagan expanded the united states military many times when people look back and they understand the success that we had in ending the cold war they believe that it was due to the increase in the size of our military let me note that did play a factor because it was a deterrent factor and it was a factor that awed many people in the developing world as well as our enemies in the communist world but that is not what switched and that is not what changed our retreat in the cold war to a great victory and the bringing down of the berlin wall what changed it was a change in strategy that ronald reagan initiated during the time that he was president he was a strong leader we came into the white house and people asked what is your strategy for dealing with the soviet threat to our freedom and the peace of the world he said the strategy is very simple we win and they lose that is what he set out the guidelines that he set out for us who worked for him in the white house and throughout the administration were that our goal was to be that the united states would win the cold war and the soviet union would lose well during that time period ronald reagan did not deploy american troops overseas like people think that he did yes he expanded our military power but he made very few deploymentsmajor deploymentsof american troops in fact in one deployment which he made to beirut where he sent thousands of marines to beirut i personally was arguing against it in the white house and went around finding out what it was all about after a few short weeks it turned into a fiasco it turned into a tragedy as well as a fiasco i might add 300 americans marines and sailors lost their lives when their headquarters was blown uptheir bunker you might say their barracks in beirut was blown up ronald reagans advisers at that time advised him to send in tens of thousands of more american troopers send in the entire 2nd marine division and show these terrorists they cant kill marines and get away with it ronald reagan made his best decision as president at that time not to make such a huge major deployment of troops into beirut otherwise we would have been in a quagmire for the rest of his administration they would have been there stuck in this war zone in beirut a nowin situation reagan knew that he also knew when he told us no we are going to get out of there as soon as we can rather than get stuck in the quagmire he initiated another policy a security policy based on a different doctrine from sending american troops to garrison in the world or sending american troops to fight other peoples battles what it was was ronald reagan initiated the reagan doctrine the reagan doctrine was basically to recognize that the enemy of our enemy was our friend and to do everything we could to identify our friends around the world who would help us defeat the soviet union the reagan doctrine had us helping people in nicaragua who were fighting against the sandinista dictatorship which was allied with the soviet union it was in africa where you had cuban troops being confronted by insurgency movements that we supported that were prodemocracy or at least antisoviet and in afghanistan where the soviet army itself was being confronted the doctrine supported those who were struggling for freedom against oppression we helped people in europe the lech walesas and the various leaders throughout eastern europe who organized resistance against the soviet domination of their countries whether it was poland or czechoslovakia or hungary they received covert support from president reagan reagan wanted yes to defeat the soviet union and that is what we did we did it in a way by helping those who were on the front lines struggling against what we saw as an evilthat is a government in russia that was controlled by an atheistic theory that an atheist dictatorship imposed upon people could reestablish new values among human beings and thus create a whole new world that monstrous philosophymonstrous because it had monstrous implications in terms of human freedom but also in the control and slaughter of those people who did not agree with that visionthat had to be defeated because it threatened the entire world by the time ronald reagan was finished with his presidency and the leadership that he provided to the free world and all those who were struggling against communism we succeeded the berlin wall came down this was done because of great leadership and a great strategy on the part of this man today we look at a totally different world from the world that reagan left us unlike the world that he inherited from his predecessor president carter reagan left us a world where the upward trend toward our civilization was undeniable that it looked like we could have generations of peace and that our enemies respected us to the point that they would not put us in jeopardy because it would be putting themselves in jeopardy reagan gave us chances for peace prosperity and freedom throughout the world today we face a totally different world it is a frightening world we have today an adversary that is every bit as evil potentially harmful and destructive to the people of the world as what we faced when ronald reagan came to the presidency at the height of the cold war yes everything was dangerous at that time and reagan gave us peace and security today we are facing evil and danger as even before in the cold war but perhaps we can compare this even to the evil and danger that america and the western world faced in the early thirties and the late twenties when nazism and fascism raised its ugly head what happened during that time period had we and the western allies been able to deal with adolf hitler perhaps there would not have been this huge conflagration of world war ii which took the lives of hundreds of millions of people but they did not deal with that as ronald reagan dealt with communism when he became president and hitler and the fascist threat eventually with their aggression put the free world and those other people who sought a better world in such a spot that war erupted and world war ii that great conflagration happened it was avoidable well today we face a similar threat we face an evil that as i say is every bit as dangerous as the evil that was faced by reagan and faced before world war ii it is a radical islamic philosophy that will slaughter people in the west without thinking twice about it or what is even worse will slaughter people in great numbers in the west after strategizing of how to do it more effectivelynot only slaughtering christians and other nonmuslims but this evil force is seeking to dominate that part of the world in which the majority of people are of the islamic faith this radical islamic terrorist evil murders more muslims than indeed they murder christians although they have been very aggressive in their murder of christians in a very demonstrable way in a way that would try to intimidate the christian world and the nonmuslim world but we have brave and courageous people within the muslim world we must not let ourselves be brought to the point that the radical islamic movement wants us to be in and that is to alienate the rest of the billion of muslims who occupy this planet and make them our enemy like ronald reagan we must seek out our friends throughout the world who are struggling against radical islamic terrorism and dictatorship and make sure that we back them up so they will have a chance to defeat this threat and this ongoing murder and chaos that is engulfing their own countries today we have such heroes overseas let us note in the last 6 years this threat has grown has gone from miniscule to being a threat that if we do not deal with it could erupt into the same type of global conflagration that we saw in world war ii and perhapsor at bestwould leave us with a war with a global split in the world like happened under communism that we defeated under ronald reagan yes we could see if this threat of radical islam is not confronted with american leadership 10 years down the road there could be a massive conflagration that would encompass for example what would happen if we do lose total control and things go totally out of control into the gulf areas in the persian gulf and in the arab world if that part of the world becomes dominant if the dominant force in that part of the world becomes this radical islamic philosophy it will then move to the stans it will then move to the great parts of africa and of central asia and that will tip the balance of power in this planet and will lead to the type of global conflagration that all of us want to avoid and to prevent but we must have the type of decisive leadership and the type of actual commitment to winning this battle against the radical islamic dictatorship that these people are trying to superimpose upon the world we need the strong commitment that we saw under ronald reagan we need that and we do not have it we do not have the leadership we need or the type of chaos that is now erupting in the arab world would not be happening what is happening in this chaos that we see is this rise of isil a group of people who are so committed to establishing a muslim dictatorship throughout their part of the world and throughout africa and yes even throughout the rest of the world where other nonmuslim communities live these people are dedicated to terrorizing the world into submission to their authority and they see their authority as coming from their radical version of god through their radical version of islam again most muslims deny and reject that type of islam but let us not forget let us not ignore the fact that this radical philosophy is based on their interpretation of islam that it is a religious fanaticism that could just like communism was a religious fanaticismit was an atheism fanaticism and we have seen christian fanaticisms in the past and they did great damage and cost the lives of great numbers of people in their day this radical fanaticism unless we defeat it now will perhaps drag the entire planet into a world war iilike conflagration how do we stop that how was ronald reagan able to stop the rise of communism the soviet expansionism that he faced when he took office and in 7 or 8 short years managed to turn that around and defeat that very enemy first he had the commitment to defeat it and i will say today that i dont believe our president has the commitment to defeat and destroy radical islamic terrorism and the radical islamic dictatorship that these fanatics would superimpose upon us instead i think our president believes in good faith that he can reach an accommodation with these folks with these fanatics that an accommodation can be reached and that we should try to prove to them that we are not their enemy well they know they are our enemy because they get their word from god not from the president of the united states that is what they believe they see these overtures the fanatic radicals like in the taliban they see it as a weakness and it only encourages the radical islamic movement for our president to try to reach accommodation or to say pleasant things to them without being aggressive with seeming to be unwilling to actually draw a line in the sand our president as most people know has trouble even uttering the words islamic terrorism in one sentence we are not going to be successful in defeating this threat that would murder us by the millions of people if they get the chance if our president is not even willing to utter the words islamic terrorism in the same sentence we have a president that after our ambassador was murdered in benghazi tried to foist off on the american people the false story that our ambassador was killed because a demonstration against a movie that insulted islam got out of control and the demonstrators killed our ambassador for weeks this president himself participated in spreading that lie now what message does it give us first of all my gosh our president isnt going to tell us the truth about radical islam but what did the muslim terrorists think at that moment the muslim terrorists were thinking my goodness we have a guy that is so weak that he cant even condemn us and condemn the killing of his own ambassador by our movement this emboldened them and that is why we heard early on support for various reform movements and we all hoped that the arab spring would be a reform movement instead our president unlike ronald reagan who sought to help those people who were the most aggressive opponents of soviet communism this president has tried to seek out those people in the muslim brotherhood and elsewhere and reach an accommodation with them that is why today we see enormous chaos and the rise of a radical fanatic islamic movement isil that will burn people alive that will recruit people throughout the west to murder people in a newspaper like we just saw in paris for drawing a cartoon that in some way made fun of their beliefs as if people arent free to make fun of other peoples beliefs no they think it is all right to murder those people and that is less civilthat is not even a sin that is a mandate as compared to murdering unarmed people an unarmed cartoonist newspaper cartoonist in france and his colleagues a policeman who happened to be a muslim laying there helpless on the ground and they murdered him outright this is fanaticism this is part of a fanatic radical islamic movement that has to be stopped they will not stop at killing one policeman who happens to be a muslim on the ground they will murder millions of others if they get the chance they are trying to establish themselves throughout the arab world right now we need to make sure we stand by our friends yet unlike ronald reagan and there was no doubt he was standing behind our friends who opposed soviet communism but what are we projecting to those people who are standing firm against this fanatic radical islamic movement that would put an islamic dictatorship on the people what are we telling our friends who are standing up against that well how about president elsisi of egypt elsisi was a general who stepped in at a time when egypt could have gone either way we had a radical islamic movement going there yes there was an elected president and he broke his word to his own people in trying to institute a caliphate in egypt they rose up against him in an aggressive shout from the people of egypt saying we will not let our country become an islamic caliphate this is egypt we believe in a democratic government here and we believe in an egyptian governmentnot some radical fanatic arab government that was superimposed on them by members of some muslim brotherhood that operates behind the scenes well we almost lost egypt and if egypt would fall today or would have fallen then there would be no chance of stopping this fanatic movement that threatens the world and threatens especially other muslim countries there would have been no chance at all president elsisi is a courageous man who has stepped forward and our president took a long time and is still taking a long time in getting solidly behind the effort to prevent egypt from becoming a bastion of fanatic islamic radicalism that would threaten the world general elsisi i visited him a year ago and he expressed my goodness we bought all of these helicopters from the united states and we need them now because there is an insurgency going on with radicals out in the sinai desert we need these helicopters and it took forever for our administration this government to provide them the spare parts the spare parts for that effort they have jumped through hoops we were doing them a favor no we should look at these people as doing us a favor they are on the front lines battling this and president elsisi just recently did something that all americans and peaceloving people throughout the world should applaud and that is he went directly to muslim groups in egypt and spoke to them and spoke on the record saying we have got to cleanse ourselves from this fanaticism in which we are intolerant of other peoples religions these people who would murder other people and commit acts of terrorism president elsisi that was courageous of him we need other leaders to follow in his footsteps has our administration done anything to congratulate president elsisi in making that incredible stand what type of things have we done to prove that we are behind him in this effort he also did something else president elsisi was the first president of egypt ever to visit a coptic church a christian church in egypt yet this administration has been just soso when it comes to elsisi yes we have not undermined him but we have not given him support which would have been a signal to all of the other leaders there to stand firm and america will stand behind you we have people like for instance the king of jordan who was only here just a few days ago and what happened a jordanian pilot was put into a cage and burned to death as a public spectacle a jordanian pilot why did they do that why did these fanatics do that because they meant to terrorize the people of the world terrorize the people of africa terrorize other people who would stand up against them and what was abdullahs reaction to that he left his meetings in the united states and flew back to jordan it is now being said that he personally flew a bombing mission against the isil people who burned that man alive now there is a leader and we should be backing him up but what do we hear just in the paper the other day that jordan is having difficulty in getting the supplies of weapons and arms that they need to make sure that they can stand firm against isil and this horrible radical fanatic movement that is sweeping through their part of the world ronald reagan knew that we needed to support great leaders who would help us end the cold war we will bring about war if leaders like king abdullah in jordan and president elsisi in egyptif people think we wont get behind them how can we count on others to take that stand how about the kurds up in northern iraq they are the ones bearing the burden bearing the brunt of all of the fighting that is going on now in iraq the other people when we tried to work things through baghdad and tried to accommodate leaders who were halfheartedly in this battle and really werent committed what happened we gave them enormous amounts of military equipment that ended up in the hands of radicals ended up being used as vehicles and guns to destroy and kill people who want the type of world that we want to live in which is a world of tolerance and freedom and peace and prosperity not radical fanatic muslim dictatorship instead the kurds have stood firm the kurds are the one group in iraq that have stood firm and are the one group that has received the least support from the united states as compared to the others now baghdad which wants to put their thumb down on the kurds we are going along with a demand with those people that all our aid that goes to the kurds goes to baghdad first that is recognizing the people who are not really on our side their power over the people who are on our side in fact there was a meeting in london just in the last few days i guess it was last weekto determine what would go on in iraq the united states was of course maybe not sitting at the table but helped organize this and were part of the process of trying to get this meeting together we didnt even insist that the kurds were there the kurds werent even at the table this is a betrayal of the people who are on the front lines fighting the big fight of today against radical islamic terrorism we betrayed them this is horrible what kind of message does that send to other people around the world who have to stand up against this onslaught of radical fanatic islamic terrorist dictatorship that would be superimposed on them we have got to make sure that these people understandwhether it is abdullahor how about the crown prince of abu dhabi for example here is a man who is so strong in his conviction and leadership in that part of the world to try to stop this terrible threat yes he is treated well we should be honoring him our administration should be leading the efforts to take the abdullahs and the crown prince there in abu dhabi and president elsisi these people deserve demonstrable support not just sort of halfheartedly getting behind them what about for example even qatar today qatar is trying to make a decision as to what to do in the face of this for example they permit us to have airstrikes against isilthis radical islamic group up in iraqthey are permitting us to use an air base in qatar to launch those attacks but we should make sure people understand and are grateful to them for it and be demonstrable about it part of it is yes stand up with your friends if somebody does something good like qatar has just done and wants to go backand by the way has taken some steps in the right direction after taking some steps in the wrong directionthey lost faith in us i believe and now they are coming back in our direction we should encourage that the other half of the equation is we need to be tough on the guys who are our enemies who are going the wrong way who are supporting radical islamic fanatic terrorism like for example pakistan we are still giving billions of dollars over a 10year period to pakistan we are giving hundreds of millions of dollars of military equipment and foreign aid to a country that is yes supporting the taliban almost all of the people that we have lost in afghanistan can be traced back to terrorists who are using pakistan as a home base but not only as a home base the isi have been actively involved in helping these fanatic terrorists that our people were up against in afghanistan how do we know that well we do know that it is known but maybe just the fact that they were giving safe haven to osama bin ladenthe murderer of 3 000 americans on 9 11they gave safe haven to this man this was oh we didnt know no one believes that they knew now to add insult to injury they have taken the doctor who gave us the location of osama bin laden and helped us bring osama bin laden to justice that doctor dr afridi is now languishing in a dungeon in a 10by10foot cell in pakistan that act by pakistan is a hostile act to the united states and for us to walk away and ignore it is to encourage others to treat us in the same way we must be tough on our enemies and friends to our friends is that a difficult formula is that too difficult for people to understand we are losing today because i believe this president has been treating our enemies better than he has been treating our friends in many cases in terms of willing to reach out to them we should be reaching out and trying to do everything we can to help the friendly countries rather than reaching out to seek accommodations with these evil countries nowhere is that better demonstrated than the announcement that we had secretly negotiated a deal with fidel castros regime in cubasecretly negotiated congress didnt know what was going on and now he has announced by edict his executive orders here is a presidentmaybe he likes castro a little bit because castro after all he could rule with edicts just like our president now likes to rule with edicts rather than go through what we call your regular order as seeking the legislative branch and seeking compromises and establishing policy in that way instead this president reversed 50 years of american policy towards cuba on his own rather than coming here to congress and working out something with us and trying to find what was the best way and opening up cuba to having the beginning of an economic relationship and having americans go freely there and then to come to the united states well he did that and there were no concessions none that the cubans made for this president to give up that 50 years 50 years of this is what our policy is you are going to have to do thisfree elections opposition parties et ceterathen we will recognize you this president gave it up and no concessions on the other side now by the way what message does that send to all these other countries again it is not just cuba what message does that send to all these other countries when we complain about human rights or we try to set a standard some standard that will indeed take that country in the right direction we end up giving up a 50year policy with no concessions thus every little petty dictator in the world or even worse every group that is out there who is trying to decide whether or not to go with radical islamist terrorism or not they know they can make whatever decision they want and eventually the united states is going to cave in because we are projecting weakness as i say the one thing ronald reagan did that was terrific was to rebuild our military and it didit created a sense of awe but it was a sense of strength he used that sense of strength but it was his strategy in helping those people throughout the world who are our friends and the friends of things we believed in and the enemy of our enemies that is what worked we are sending the wrong message to the people who will be the enemy of our enemies we are undermining by not providing positive and forceful support for those people who are standing upthe crown prince of abu dhabi and these others and abdullah and jordan and president elsisi in egyptby not demonstrably standing with them we send the wrong message throughout the world that is why things are falling apart that is why things are not going in the right direction this isnt we just happen to live in a time when things are chaotic that is not the case just like ronald reagan didnt just live in the times when there was a soviet communist threat that was undermining the peace of the world that didnt just happen it was the basis of things that yes what they did but also our response to that threat today this administration i believe has led us down a path that has created the chaos that we now see created a situation where you have a radical fanatic islamic dictatorship movement that not only tries to take over and dominate the islamic part of the world but is threatening terrorist acts and has engaged in terrorist acts we will have more and more bombings like we saw at the boston marathon we will have more and more terrorist actions taken in western europe as we saw in paris or in africa unless we step forward and let the world know that we are strong we are strong in our commitment and we stand by those who will help us in this battle i recently visited new york city and i had not been there for a long time i had never gone to the 9111 memorial i visited the 9111 memorial and i would advise anyone who has not been there to go there this is a memorial to the 3 000 americans who died on 9111 most of them there at the world trade center in those two great towers that were brought down on that day you should go anyone hearing my voicemy colleagues othersshould go and see this they have managed to get a picture of almost every one of the victims who died that day many of course were firemen and policemen who when the airplane struck that building instead of running away and rushing away they ran towards the building they ran there to see what they could do to help and they gave their lives these heroic people we have to have a government as heroic as our own people if we are going to triumph over the people that slaughtered those people today they slaughtered them in 9111 and they will slaughter them today i looked at those pictures of those 3 000 peopleand i was in the government when that happened and i worked with reagan before that but on 9111 we had been here a long time and we are all part of this we owe it to the people of the united states all of us on both sides of the aisle and in the executive branch and whoever else who is the government of this country we owe it to our people to make sure we are doing the right thingand i looked into their faces and i brought my children with me to see this and i said look all of those people do you know what they are telling us they are telling us to me and to all of us here in this body you let us down you let us down dont do it again dont let there be another wall in another city with 20 000 pictures on it because they have got some sort of dirty bomb or something these people that we are facing today are capable of that i am not arguing for major deployments of military units overseas occupation garrison in the world like we did for too long and i do not think it was right for us to go into iraq in the first place i do argue that when we find people on our side like ronald reagan did we need to have a strong military and we need to make sure that the world respects us then we need to have stands and activities and actions that win their respect them knowing that we stand with those people who will stand firm against this threat to the world otherwise some day there could be another world war iilike thing 10 years down the road when we say why didnt you stop that fanatic hitler when he was just walking around goosestepping around in these towns in germany when he could have been stopped why didnt you stop him then then there was hundreds of millions of people this could lead to that type of conflagration one thing we know unless we stop this radical movement there now they will find ways of killing thousands of americans and there will be other walls with other pictures saying why didnt you do something i call on my colleagues now to seriously look at this challenge that we face my negative comments about what i believe is the president not dealing with this situation in the right way is something that i am saying from the heart and i am not doing this for political reasons let me just say today that we see examples of where we need to take stands we need to make sure for example that the nouveau regime in iran is facing a president of the united states and an american government that are making demands that they do not use this system that they are developing now they have signed a treaty saying they would not have a nuclear weapon we should hold them to that treaty and we should be helping the people in iran who are struggling against that nouveau regime i do not say we should attack iran with american military might we should be supportive and we should have been so all along there were demonstrators in the streets of tehran and there was no message there was no message at all of support from our government at that time that was one of the first things this president didhe refrained from helping and supporting those young activists for democracy in iran the baloch people are fighting against the corruption and oppression of the pakistani government which is dominated by these radicals we should be helping the baloch who can also be active in iran i might say there are options that we can have throughout the world todayactions both in terms of policy and in terms of actually helping people struggle for freedomthat will ensure the peace of the world 10 years down the road as ronald reagan did when he took over he left us a better world we need to take the steps now to make sure that when we leave this body when we leave congressand whoever becomes president the next time aroundthat we leave this government so that our people have a greater chance for freedom a greater chance to live in peace we need to make sure that our people can live in peace and prosperity those pictures on the wall at the 9 11 memorial shout out to us do your duty you didnt do it you let us down dont do it again make sure the american people are safe you have a challenge now meet that challenge stand firm stand strong behind those who are with

together i did it for the last 4 years and served in the capacity of the gentleman from maryland as the ranking member of the budget committee for the prior 4 years before that so i want to thank the gentleman for bringing an outstanding budget to the floor first of all this is a budget to be proud of this is a budget that makes our country stronger this is a budget that balances it is pretty important to note that hardworking taxpayers the people that elected us here to represent them they have to live within their means well so should government that is the basic decision here when you take a look at the budgets that are being considered here today we are basically trying to get the government to get back into the business of being honest with people about our finances here is the problem our government is making promises to people in this country that it knows it cant keep that is dishonesty what this budget does is it puts our budget back on track so that the government can keep these promises the promises that people are organizing their lives around what the gentleman from maryland and the presidents budget says is just keep raising taxes tax more oh by the way that is not enough then we need to borrow more and spend more that seems to be the path to prosperity according to them and look at where we are highest poverty rates in a generation our economy is growing below 2 percent in most cases below 3 which is what we were supposed to be growing at the gentleman i just listened to his rhetoric he says this slices this slashes we are chopping away at opportunity here is what this budget does instead of increasing spending on average like the presidents budget does at 5 1 percent it does it at 3 4 percent we are saying lets get the government to live within its means government spending will still increase on average 3 4 percent a year instead of 5 1 percent a year i guess that is the difference between whether people can live the american dream or not whether we are slashing or chopping or doing all these horrible awful things to people just dont buy all this overheated rhetoric the problem is we have got to balance the budget we have got to get this debt under control we see the storm clouds on the horizon and what this budget does is it gets government to be honest with the taxpayers that give us this money in the first place so that we can meet these priorities honestly and balance the budget and get this debt on the right track we invest it the right way by giving people more of their own money so that they can make decisions on what is right for their family instead of having washington run it all now there is one last thing i would like to say as i get carried away on the rhetoric the cbo is an agency we use quite a bit here and the congressional budget office is a very important government agency that gives us all of our cost estimates this budget is written on their estimates for the last 6 years we have had a director at the congressional budget office by the name of doug elmendorf who has done an outstanding job as director of the cbo i have worked very closely with dr elmendorf and with cbo in my prior capacity he was a democratic appointee but the cbo director is supposed to call the balls and the strikes and play it fair doug elmendorf has done that i just simply want to say for the record that we wish him well he is leaving at the end of the month we wish him well we thank him for his service we thank the congressional budget office for all the hard work that they put in so that we can be here on the floor with these budgets and we wish him great success in the future in whatever it is he chooses and thank him for his service to this house to this congress and to our country i simply want to say

friday and of course easter now the gentleman spoke with great passion but there is one thing i think you missed in this i hope you have the same passion for those at the epa who knew of flint and stayed silent who did not warn those of the water that had been poisoned the gentleman talks very boldly about wanting things done but we should talk about what has happened as we speak today we just had a hearing on flint michigan where you had gina mccarthy in you had the governor of michigan in secondly the gentleman knows that when it comes to zika we had a meeting together where we pulled in all those in government who are dealing with this issue and they will tell you there is no short answer for it they will tell you the mosquito is not as easy as just spraying and they will tell you each and every day they are learning something more the white house did not send us a supplemental until just a few weeks ago we have done nothing but move even faster there is no agencyfrom the nih or the cdclacking in money to be acting today and they will answer that question for you they have money to go forward and do the work that they need to do and that we believe needs to happen we can argue later about where that money comes from but in no way have we stopped or slowed down we have actually been in front of this if i recall correctly it was me who approached you on the floor and requested that we work together on this it was me who called you and said lets make this bipartisan so we brought all the committee members in with the secretary and directors so in no way do i want the american public to think for one moment that we are not doing the work now there is not one easy answer for it you can look around the world to australia they have been battling this for quite some time there are challenges but we want to make sure we get it done i want to work with you to make that happen but i dont want to play political games with it you know as well as i do if you think we are here just on good friday and there is going to be a fundamental change there wont be but we are making change on the work we are doing when it comes to puerto rico we have been working on puerto rico we have been working on puerto rico so much the committee chairman just went there the last time we had a district work period to investigate so did congressman sensenbrenner and chairman bishop yesterday the speaker myself the committee chair from the judiciary committee congressmen goodlatte sensenbrenner and bishop all met after that meeting congressman sensenbrenner directly went to speak to leader pelosi on what we are doing because we are doing this in a bipartisan manner i think you are going to see hearings being scheduled very shortly we want to get this right i understand your frustration because my frustration is across the chamber over here with the senate because we have acted many times on the direction of where we are going the last part i would bring up is that we are going to have disagreements on the budget and maybe your argument is thinking the budgets are different they are different we have brought a budget to the floor every year we have been in the majority here and they have balanced every time the president has sent a budget here and we have put this on the floor there have only been two votes on the other side of the aisle for the presidents budget so yes we are going to have disagreements on the budget because we are going to fight over here to balance the budget and give us a brighter future and yes maybe philosophically you think we need to spend more money but that is a disagreement that i think the american public expect you and i to have a disagreement on and fight for what we philosophically believe in i just firmly disagree with your last question on all threenot from a basis of politics but a basis between you and i knowing what we are doing you and i both know personally what we have been working on we havent

record drought but what we already know is that california officials pushing the states highspeed rail proposal wont be deterred by skyrocketing costs an absence of private investment or the 55 millionand growingfunding gap what we didnt know was the extent of secrecy and mismanagement taxpayers would face at the hands of state officials pushing this project just this month we learned that in 2013 the agencys main contractor projected that the first phases costs had risen 31 percent this information was concealed by the highspeed rail authority and only released 2 years later after pressure from congress while the lack of transparency is unacceptable especially given that taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for this project the fundamental issue here is that the entire project is a rusein literal terms a train wreckin that state officials knew this for some time and that those same officials hid this from the public in 2008 voters were promised an 800mile system that would link sacramento san francisco los angeles and san diego cost about 34 billion and would have less than onethird of the costs paid by the state through its taxpayers the system was promised to travel from san francisco to los angeles in under 2 hours and 40 minutes fast forward to 2011 when the price had shot up from 34 billion to 100 billion the plan was reduced to only l a to san francisco and the state was quick to grab billions ofunknown at the timefederal stimulus that came along later funding that could have been used for critical needs like roads or water infrastructure that california needs so desperately as well as now shifting capandtrade dollars recently created to try and prop up highspeed rail and its deficient budget dollars as a state senator at the time the first bill i introduced was one that would require them to come up with the ultimate full plan of the cost of doing highspeed rail having not succeeded in getting that through a majority that still liked it as it was my next legislation was to say now that we know this is over 100 billion lets put this back on the ballot and in front of the voters since the price has tripled and they were deceived at what it would cost at the time that too met defeat as those in the majority still wished to continue this boondoggle today the governor claims the price has fallen to 68 billion for what would be an illegal system based on what the voters passed under prop 1a however the estimate ignores the costs of tunneling through the tehachapi mountains ignores cost spikes in the initial construction segment and ignores the rising costs of lands acquisition due to people having to fight because they are having their homes their farms and their small businesses paved over by this project the promises made in 2008 ranged from low ticket prices to questionable job figures including the fact that they were claiming there would be a million new jobs from highspeed rail when we pinned them down in committee a little bit later they said well that would mean a million jobyears that number has since been pared down all these have been proven false in fact these claims are so misleading that a state court has forbidden the legislature from writing ballot measure descriptions earlier this week i sent out a survey to residents in my weekly enewsletter to constituents in californias first district my own district asking them to share their thoughts on highspeed rail as it is now i listed a number of suggested actions we could take on highspeed rail from leaving it as is to defunding it and asked which best represents our constituents position on the project now of the nearly 1 600 answers we received their views are pretty clear nearly half of them said they thought funding for highspeed rail should be redirected to invest in water storage and water infrastructure to help our state right now in this drought about 20 percent thought the state should subpoena the cost documents and require highspeed rail authority officials to testify why the figures were concealed approximately 18 percent thought californias highspeed rail should undergo federal investigation in response to these allegations given that the project involves the use of federal funds a scant 7 percent thought we should keep going forward with highspeed rail and believed the current price tag is a worthwhile investment of public funds lastly 4 percent supported investing in highspeed rail provided the project stayed within the old constraints the old pricesthe ones they saw on the ballot so at best you see 11 percent that might support highspeed rail and 4 percent that might under the old price which is nowhere near what was projected people dont like this project dont trust those advocating for it and they deserve better than to see their own tax dollars used to lie to them no new federal dollars will come from here to help this project be propped up anymore it is time we start prioritizing funding for projects that actually address real problems facing california such as the current drought it is time to apply common sense to this situation we have a state whose economy depends on a sound water supply yet in the midst of a historic drought we are still chasing this highspeed rail boondoggle rather than throwing billions of dollars away lets get to what people demand and will help

with products that are subsidized by foreign governments and therefore priced below market value american companies waste valuable time and legal fees bringing cases against unfairly subsidized products that are dumped into the united states when american companies win these dumping cases they deserve to have the penalties enforced unfortunately american companies have not been competing on

ryan dr boustany mr smith and the steel caucus for working with me on this important reform every foreign company wants to sell their goods on american store shelves to american consumers we must make sure we have the tools we need at the border to prevent foreign trade cheaters from sneaking their goods onto our shelves without paying the appropriate duties we must protect american manufacturers and american jobs from trade cheaters additionally i urge support for this bill because of critical protections against misguided attempts to use trade agreements to rewrite our domestic immigration

i want us to take stock in more ways than one i often talk about having been born and raised in a parsonage one of the earliest discussions i remember my father having was with a few other ministers trying to decide what to do about getting rid of a minister that had betrayed his trust so i think that we have to look at these issues on all sides i honor police officers i have relatives who are police officers i have great friends who are police officers but the fact of the matter is there are times when people of the cloth need to be defrocked and there are times when people in the law enforcement community need to take stock the fact of the matter is we do know that any time you see a young african american being stopped 52 times by one jurisdiction something is wrong and i say to my 21yearold grandson son when you are stopped by the police suppress your manhood so that you can be sure that you come home safe at night lets take stock on all sides of this issue this is not about being against law enforcement i support law enforcement but i do not support those who use the color blue to commit criminal acts"], [0.0002690255641937256, 0.4997309744358063, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume members of the house i rise in support of h r 2137 the federal law enforcement selfdefense and protection act this bill would authorize federal law enforcement officers to carry their governmentissued firearms during government shutdowns and administrative furloughs that result from lapses in appropriations essentially this measure would help ensure that those who protect us are able to continue to do so even during an official furlough the ability of our federal law enforcement officers to respond to critical incidents should not be impeded particularly when violent crimes are committed in their presence h r 2137 does not expand federal law enforcement officers authority to carry firearms the bill merely authorizes these officers to continue to carry their federally issued firearms as if a furlough had not occurred this legislation recognizes the very real threat of harm that many of our officers face particularly special agents on a regular basisa threat that does not simply disappear because of a government shutdown in 2012 for example more than 1 800 federal law enforcement officers were assaulted and of those approximately 200 sustained serious injuries even when off duty federal law enforcement officers remain the target of assault for example between 2011 and 2014 27 law enforcement officers were killed while they were off duty although this legislation only concerns federal officers i want to take a moment to recognize the state local and federal officers who have sacrificed their lives in serving our communities this week law enforcement officers throughout the united states have come to washington to show their support for our fallen officers during national police week in the spirit of national police week it is vitally important that our federal officers are able to protect people in our communities themselves and their family members from the continuing threats they encounter given the fact that h r 2137

amendment would strike section 512 of the bill which prohibits the use of funds to construct or expand any facility in the united states to house any individual detained at the detention facility at guantanamo bay cuba simply put this section is designed to prevent the closure of guantanamo we are still holding 122 people at guantanamo 57 of whom have been cleared for release these people have been found guilty of nothing are believed to be guilty of nothing and have been judged not to pose any danger nonetheless they are not released by what claim of right do we continue to imprison them as for the detainees who have not been cleared for release this bill is designed to ensure that we will continue to hold them at guantanamo indefinitely we dont know whether these people are enemy soldiers or not or are guilty of anything or not some of them may be and some of them probably are not those facts must be determined in a fair proceeding of some sort but at guantanamo there are no proceedings the military tribunal process at guantanamo has been at a complete standstill for years and we cannot hold civilian trials at guantanamo so we are holding people for no purpose with no proceedings no hearings no opportunity to determine their guilt or innocence and we are holding them essentially forever i recall a briefing last year at which representative and nowsenator cotton said that these people had been determined to be guilty by congress aside from the fact that congress has not determined anybody to be guilty and aside from the fact if congress tried to determine someone to be guilty of a crime or of anything that it would be a violation of the bill of attainder section of the congress it is simply not true these people have been determined to be guilty of nothing and they deserve like anybody else to have a day in court how long will we let this shameful episode in american history continue to overcome this challenge to one of the founding principles of the united states which is that no person may be deprived of liberty without due process of law and certainly may not be deprived of liberty indefinitely without due process of law we must close the detention facility at guantanamo now so that they can be properly charged and tried in a federal court this will afford the detainees no additional constitutional rights the supreme court has already ruled that detainees at guantanamo have the same constitutional rights as they would if they were to be brought to the united states the government should transfer to federal court any detainee against whom it has evidence the federal courts in contrast to the military tribunals have an excellent record in prosecuting and convicting terrorists anyone not charged should either be classified as a prisoner of war and treated as such or should be released back to his home country or elsewhere if that prevents a problem to his life or safety this is not a radical suggestion it has been our tradition for the entire history of our country and has been our unbroken legal practice until now the president can and should without delay authorize the secretary of defense to use existing certification and waiver procedures to repatriate and resettle abroad all prisoners who have been cleared for release and he should arrange trial in the united states for all prisoners who are not cleared for release we must close this facility we must try and convict and sentence the people who are guilty of acts of terrorism or aggression against the united states or in accord with our moral and constitutional principles release those who are not guilty of offenses against the united states only so can we restore our national honor this amendment is necessary to start this process because without our bringing some of these prisoners to the united states for trial we cannot try them i urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment i reserve the balance of my time"],

being supportive of all of our work i also want to thank my dear friend from texas ted poe he has been a wonderful partner and initiator of reform and of thoughtful legislation on our committee it has been my privilege to cosponsor a lot of legislation with mr poe to try to make things better today i rise in support of another such example the foreign aid transparency and accountability act of 2015 this bill is a project i have worked on with judge poe for a number of years now in the 112th congress a previous iteration of the bill passed this body by a unanimous vote we hope for a similar outcome in this congress and for quick senate consideration and passage the bill directs the president to establish monitoring and evaluation guidelines for the 22 federal agencies that are charged with implementing some piece of development and economic assistance the guidelines will require m e plans as part of the project development process and agencies will be encouraged to incorporate the findings of evaluations and impact studies into subsequent foreign assistance programs this feedback loop will include measurable goals performance metrics and a clearinghouse for lessons learned on unitedstates led aid projects something long overdue after 60plus years of foreign aid additionally the legislation requires that the documents and reports created under this m e regime be made available to the public on foreignassist ance gov this administration has developed an encouraging record on foreign aid transparency the foreign assistance dashboard which was created in 2010 is a great example of demonstrating a promising inclination toward disclosure that we hope to enshrine in this law this measure will strengthen and codify those transparency best practices to ensure that they exist as agency policy under future administrations that might not be as accommodating of the aid communitys demand for this information aid programs that are held accountable for their performance and results can be made more effective and their impact on communities and countries abroad can be more easily demonstrated perhaps with more information we can dispel the commonly held belief that 26 percent of our budget goes to foreign aid when as my friend judge poe pointed out it is actually less than 1 percent the unitedstates foreign assistance operation does not lack passion the men and women who put themselves in harms way overseas and who take their families to remote areas of the world often dangerous in the interest of helping vulnerable populations are certainly not seeking fame glory or fortune they do it because they can envision a path to prosperity in even the most povertystricken areas of the world and they see the promise of democracy in the face of the most repressive and authoritarian regimes while our passion is welldefined our mission and metrics are not regarding our mission i was a staffer on the senate foreign relations committee the last time congress actually passed a foreign aid authorization bill in 1986 the original foreign assistance act of 1961 which judge poe cited listed five principal goals for foreign aid today we have more than 260 some are competing and some are redundant what is our core mission today until january 2014 usaids mission statement read as follows usaid accelerates human progress in developing countries by reducing poverty advancing democracy building market economies promoting security responding to crises and improving quality of life working with governments institutions and civil society we assist individuals to build their own futures by mobilizing the full range of americas public and private resources through our expert presence overseas that is not a clear mission statement i am hopeful this bill will help us focus on the foreign assistance operations while i think we have some distance to travel in streamlining the legislative construct for foreign assistance and clearly articulating our mission we have an opportunity today to make immense progress toward establishing badly needed metrics for aid programs with the passage of this bill it is time to apply a datadriven approach to constructing an assistance operation that has the support of both this congress and of a wellinformed public i urge my colleagues to support this bill again i particularly thank my friend judge poe for his leadership for his initiative and for his vision with respect to this subject i know it is going to actually make unitedstates foreign assistance investments in the future a lot more
