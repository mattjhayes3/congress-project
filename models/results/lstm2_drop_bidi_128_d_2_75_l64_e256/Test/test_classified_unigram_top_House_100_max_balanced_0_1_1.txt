colleague brian donnelly in introducing the longterm health care amendments of 1987 certainly i commend president reagan health and human services secretary otis bowen and my esteemed colleagues pete stark and bill gradison for their leadership and efforts in developing legislation which addresses the acute illness area i am however very concerned about the direction in which we are headed on this issue under both the reagan and the starkgradison proposals approximately 5 to 8 percent of medicares 30 million elderly would benefit from the part a and part b payment expansions i strongly believe that by limiting our focus to the acute care illness we will be missing a real opportunity to act upon what i consider to be the real risks that most senior citizens face in a truly catastrophic illnessnamely those associated with longterm and nursing home care the time has come for congress to reexamine the medicare program and to address the changing needs of our senior citizens therefore the legislation i am introducing today addresses some of the most critical longterm care needs of our elderly population the bill also offers incentives to the workingage population for developing their own longterm care protection i have attempted to create balance in the bill by incorporating a combination of governmental individual and employer incentives to address the issue of longterm care my legislation has three major titles first my bill creates a new part c of the medicare program to offer financial assistance for nursing home home health and communitybased services that the elderly need for long periods of time this longterm care benefit is income related that is the amount of an individuals outofpocket expense is related to his income level the second provision of the bill provides for individual incentives to allow an individual over the age of 50 to contribute up to 1 500 of noncoreinterest income toward the purchase of a longterm care insurance policy as an added incentive this policy would retain a cashsurrender value so that should the individual predecease the use of the policy its value would roll over into his estate and could be transferred to his spouse finally the bill provides for group incentives for longterm care catastrophic protection this congress has a real opportunity to act on some very critical health policy issues but i hope we do so in a manner that looks toward tomorrow as well as takes in the needs of today congress cannot claim victory on this issue if it fails to address the longterm care needs 6f the elderly under

reported by the committee on agriculture as h r 177 the goal of that legislation is to help meet the food needs of homeless people an issue the committee has looked at in depth i support these and other programs aimed at providing food assistance to needy individuals and families in fact these are but two of the several programs operated in the unitedstates department of agriculture to provide food assistance the usda programs alone account for over 20 billion in 1987 spending the committee bill does not increase expenditures in 1987 that was one of the goals of this legislation and i commend the subcommittee chairman for achieving that target however there are significant costs to the budget in 1988 and the outyears with insufficient offsets to accommodate these spending increases the committee was informed that the 1988 budget resolution will accommodate this additional spending at this point the 100th congress has not adopted the 1988 budget resolution and yet we are proposing to spend money we do not know if we will have for example the shelter deduction ceiling might be as low as 162 if the most recent weight given fuels and other utilities were used throughout the period under consideration included in the food assistance title are several changes to the food stamp program and reauthorization and improvement of the temporary emergency food assistance program this title first allows states to conduct outreach activities aimed at persons without permanent homes to encourage them to participate in the food stamp program the federal government will pay onehalf of all outreach costs second increases the shelter deduction for food stamp participants with high shelter costs from 149 per month to 168 per month effective third exempts housing assistance payments made on behalf of households living in temporary quarters from consideration as income for food stamp purposes such payments will not be counted if the temporary housing lacks facilities for preparation and cooking of hot meals or refrigeration fourth coordinates the annual adjustment of food stamp income levels with annual adjustments of food stamp benefit levels and deductions all will take place on october 1 fifth denies the earned income deduction to food stamp participants who deliberately fail to report earnings sixth allows the secretary upon certification of need by a state governor to provide up to 14 million pounds of surplus cheese for distribution within the state governors must certify that there are eligible participants not being served by tefap or that the unemployment rate within the state has risen and that the distribution of surplus cheese will not substantially displace the commercial sales of cheese seventh reauthorizes tefap through 1990 at the following levels 1988 52 million 1989 53 9 million 1990 56 2 million according to the congressional budget office there is no cost to the budget in 1987 as a result of the food assistance for the homeless provisions however in 1988 the cbo estimates the cost will be 111 millionthe total cost through 1990 is 387 million the cost of these provisions in 1988 and the outyears remains a concern to me as i stated during the subcommittee and committee consideration the congress has not yet adopted a 1988 budget resolution and i believe we must be budget conscious we must be assured that we can pay for future increases in the budget as we make these changes not only for aid to the homeless but for all expenditures of taxpayer dollars h r 558 of which the food assistance to the homeless title is just one part presents even greater budget problems cbo estimates the cost to be 500 million in 1987 with no offsets to pay for these additional expenditures at least in the agriculture committee we did exercise fiscal responsibility for 1987 and show no additional expenditures to the budget however for 1988 and the outyears we too have problems i am concerned about the homeless individuals and families however as we did in house joint resolution 102 we must be able to pay for the benefits we provide of the many issues before the 100th congress this is one which i find to be difficult to resolve as i have said before during the several hearings the subcommittee has held concerning this issue of food assistance to the needy i firmly believe that in our nation of abundance it is a tragedy for one child or one elderly person or anyone to go hungry we are a generous countryboth through government programs and through the private sector usda programs alone provide over 20 billion in food assistance private sector contributions to various nonprofit organizations regularly increase from year to year and approached 80 billion last year and yet there is no dispute that there are significant numbers of homeless people in both urban and rural areas of the united states the causes of homelessness are many and are complex they include the deinstitutionalization of mental health patients redevelopment of cities and the loss of lowrent housing highunemployment rates and a breakdown in traditional family structure the federal state and local programs available to low income individual and families often do not meet the needs of the homeless despite the bilions spent each year while housing is the key issue in dealing with homelessness other services are needed as well these include food assistance health and mental health clinics and for those who are able assistance in getting and keepng jobs the two major programs under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee that provide food assistance are the food stamp program and the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap neither of which are designed for the homeless but both provide assistance to this group of individuals through the food stamp program participants are provided food coupons which in most cases supplement the food budget of low income people however for the homeless difficulties arise in making full use of food coupons since they lack homes and cooking and food storage facilities last year the congress amended the food stamp act to allow the homeless to use food coupons in shelters and soup kitchens this provision was patterned after a proposal that i was working on along with chairman panetta concerning demonstration projects designed to allow the homeless to purchase low cost nutritious meals at soup kitchens while the amendment adopted last year does not address all concerns we covered in our proposal i am anxious to see how this further extension of the food stamp program to the homeless will work the pilot project we proposed presented a unique opportunity to begin solving a difficult problem in a straightforward manner lacking facilities for storage and preparation of food homeless individuals are unable to make optimal use of food stamp benefits to which they may be entitled by permitting such eligible individuals to use food stamps to purchase lowcost prepared meals the proposal would increase the effectiveness of the program for some of its most needy beneficiaries those operating the soup kitchens could have used food stamps for the purchase of food in large quantities thereby maximizing the efficiency of food stamp benefits for the homeless in addition the use of food stamps would have been limited to the purchase of food rather than preparation services and other associated costs also maximizing food stamp program funds by alleviating hunger and adhere to the goal of the food stamp act the second program under our committees jurisdiction is the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap provides surplus commodities to states for distribution to organizations serving lowincome people some of whom are homeless in 1988 it is anticipated that the commodities made available will include 420 million pounds of cheese 180 million pounds of rice 144 million pounds of flour 96 million pounds of honey 96 million pounds of nonfat dry milk 72 million pounds of butter and 48 million pounds of cornmeal with regard to tefap i am pleased that the congress acted to overturn the proposed deferral of 28 6 million of tefap administrative funds i introduced house joint resolution 124 which disapproved that deferral so that the full amount of money states had planned to use to distribute surplus foods will be available during this year the agriculture committee may be able to contribute to easing the problems of the homeless but solving this problem will require much more and must involve not only the federal government but state and local governments and our communities as well i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9783621430397034, 0.9783621430397034, 0,

we are here to talk myself and a couple of my colleagues about a issue which is as old as his country is old for over 200 years we have had october 4 1988 discussions and debate on whether or not the members of the unitedstates house and the unitedstates senate should be limited in the number of terms that they might serve obviously they are not limited at the present time but many of us feel that it would serve this countrys best interest now more than ever if those terms were limited in 1980 when i was first elected to congrese i believed that and i believe it even more today in 1980 i introduced a resolution in congress calling on this body and on the public to have a constitutional amendment to limit congress to six 2year terms in the house and two ayear terms in the senate i also introduced a resolution that was a companion to that as an alternative that called for three 4year house terms and two 6yeat senate terms as a constitutionally mandated limit we limit the term of our president why do we not limit the terms of our house and our senate well there are a lot of reasons i suppose politically why that is not very palatable for this body to do to itself or to do to the voters but it is something this year in particular because we have just gone through a celebration of the constitutions anniversary it is noteworthy that in the republican convention in our platform one of my former colleagues from south carolina tommy hartnet offered in the resolution forum of the platform a particular provision that to the best of my knowledge and our research has never been offered before in any convention of any political party in the history of our country and it was adopted in that portion of the platform dealing with term limitation it reads as follows we favor a constitutional amendment which will place some restrictions on the number of consecutive terms a man or woman may serve in the unitedstates house of representatives or the unitedstates senate so this evening i thought it was appropriate to talk about that for a little bit to see what we might join together to do about this process and perhaps to gain some new adherents to the purposes and objectives of this term limitation concept the earliest proposed constitutional amendment to limit was introduced in the first congress in 1789 the resolution n that congress stipulated that no person could serve more than 6 years in an 8year period actually the concept predated the constitution the continental congress adopted a proposal by john dixon of delaware in 1777 limiting delegates tinder the articles of confederation to serving 3 years in any 6year period however after the first congress the issue of limiting terms laid dormant until the mid1940s the primary reason for this dormancy was in the early years of our country to serve only 2 years in the unitedstates house and then retire nobody served longer than that they just did not as late as the 1840s 40 to 50 percent of the congress left office after each election 40 to 50 percent as late as the 1840s from 1860 to 1920 the average length of service doubled from 4 to 8 years by 1901 when the 57th congress convened for the first time less than 30 percent of its members were freshmen in 1981 when the 97th congress convened only 17 percent of the unitedstates house of representatives were freshmen a remarkably low number i think most of us are aware that with increasing frequency we reelect incumbents i think last time we had an election in this country a couple of years ago we reelected 98 percent of our colleagues back to the house there are some who think we will reelect approximately that percentage again this time i do not think that is healthy for our nation we need new ideas vigorous concerns here not just a question of some of the issues we are going to talk about tonight that might otherwise be a good idea why we should limit the terms of congressmen but just for the sake of getting bright new faces in this body with greater frequency than simply based upon a retirement prospect perhaps the most significant growth issue in this whole idea has been the public support for the concept in 1946 a gallup poll showed 40 percent of the american public favored lengthening the terms of house members to 4 years by 1961 51 percent of the public supported 4year terms and this was about the same in 1977 however in the most recent gallup poll published in the washington post on may 17 1981 a clear 59 percent of the american people supported the lengthening of terms of house members to 4 years that same poll showed that by a margin of better than 2 to 1 the american people want to limit unitedstates senators and representatives to a maximum of 12 years in office i think that is the most important issue of this it does not seem to me that the two should be separated but there are some who strongly do not believe in the lengthening of house terms but whatever the case may be those of us who support the concept of lengthening terms also support the concept of limiting them and those who join us only on that issue i must say to them that i think that this is the single most issue important issue and that is the one that we are here to talk about tonight the simple fact is that the concern of most congressmen for getting reelected causes them to spend a good deal of time and energy on matters related to that and that is unfortunately what all of us do that influences the decisionmaking away from what otherwise would be the course of better judgment in many cases not all case but in many cases a limitation on terms would assure that a substantial portion of congress at any time would be ineligible for reelection and vitually unfettered by the constraints of reelection in addition to limiting terms if there were a lengthening of terms i think the effect would be even greater the bottom line is simply that there is not enough time for us to do all the duties that are expected of us today as opposed to back in 1840 or 1900 or 1940 for that matter we have career congressmen back in the early days of this country we found people who served were really here for only a couple months a year in fact well into the 1940s and 1950s it was the practice to stay no more than 3 months a year at one time not very long ago it was 6 months now it is a yearround proposition and it is very difficult to find anyone who could conceive of congressmen going back home after a couple months here and working in other jobs they do not do that and that is really the most seriouz problem when coupled with the pressaires that come with todays society that is really the bottom line problem we are career oriented here once you get elected to congress at a certain stage of your life and you are here it is like any other job there is a security blanket factor there is a great desire to be reelected instead of going back out into public life while for some people and for the public in some instances that is a great service a great sacrifice as a matter of fact for many others and for the public as a whole i think that it is not it is jnst tile opposite of that but the fact of life is that you are not going to change we are not going to change the business of congress there are so many issues so many subject matters to be brought up the government of the united states has grown so large that a yearround functioning body is really a necessity and i think it will always be with us but coming with that comes again this pressure for remaining here this desire this lack of going back and being reinvigorated by going back to a job and being a businessman in a business somewhere back home or being a doctor or a lawyer or whatever the profession is and then staying here year after year and getting somewhat isolated from it it is a difficult thing but that is what has happened and unless we limit the terms of congressmen we are going to continue to see this trend and it will not be an easy one to break coming along with that come the pressures o fundraise the pressures that come on us in the voting process when it comes to making a decision on what is the best thing to do i remember when i was here in the first term of congress there was a vote on the question of funding for libraries in this country nobody is against libraries there was a 10 million program that had come out of lyndon johnsons great society 10 million a year not billion but million now that is a lot of money to me and to you and to everybody else but by the way we do things around here 10 million a year is not comparatively a lot of money there was a proposal to eliminate that program and that proposal was supported by a number of the original adherents of it saying really the purpose of the federal government is not to support libraries that is a comnmunity thing back home the reason we had the 10 million was to get the rural libraries going to stimulate libraries to be started and we have done most all we need to do in that regard and if we are going to get this budget of ours in balance it is time that we proceed and do something about that and go ahead and eliminate this program well it came to a vote on the floor here i remember some of my good conservative colleagues as well as others here in this body scratching their heads a minute and i heard a murmuring around the room here as that vote was in progress you know we ought to get rid of this thing it isnt serving any purpos6 it has already done what its supposed to do we have seeded some rural libraries but you know i wonder what the friends of the library back home would think of me if i were to go on record and appear to have voted against libraries so our friends my colleagues voted overwhelmingly despite the recommendations of even the authors of that proposal and the original adherents to it voted overwhelmingly to continue the funding of that 10 million a year program that is one small example of what goes on here that is indeed a real big problem for us so that is one of many reasons why i became convinced more so than ever after i got here that we ought to limit the terms of congresmen in this body and get back to more of a citizen legislator and have an opportunity for there to be a relief of that pressure so that there is not so much a concern about what is somebody back home over every little issue going to think of how i did it and more concern of what is right and what should be done in restricting the budget and getting some common sense back into the government that is just one of a number of reasons i have had a number of my good friends who have supported this concept since we all came together here in 1980 who are with us tonight one of them is the gentleman from oregon mr denny smritm the gentleman looks like he is wanting me to yield to him and i am delighted to yield to the gentleman from oregon"], [0.0002753734588623047,

amendment i want to thank the staff of the committee and the gentleman who is controlling the time for their assistance in drafting this amendment this is part of an overall effort that i have been trying to make over the last 12 to 13 months to raise the issue of delinquent debt that is owed to the federal government as hard as it is to believe in an era of grammrudman problems we find now that the federal governments delinquent debt portfolio amounts to 68 3 billion i hope everybody heard that individuals and corporations now owe the government delinquent debt 68 3 billion that number has grown by 10 billion from fiscal year 1985 to since 1981 there has been a 40 billion increase in this delinquent debt in other words the federal governments delinquent debt has increased by 129 percent since 1981 the federal governments role in this whole credit allocation is enormous by the end of 1986 direct loans valued at 252 billion loans extended by governmentsponsored enterprises amounted to 453 billion and loans guaranteed by the federal government totaled 450 billion now when you take a look at marad itself and everybody understands that the maritime administration has had a very difficult time in recent years and this is not an effort to try to lay on top of those problems or to complicate the situation for them but i think it is important that we take a look at a few of the numbers the amount of delinquent debt contained in the marad was about 107 million in 1980 and has grown to 1 4 billion in 1986 a 1 236percent increase a lot of that is caused by problems that are clearly beyond the control of people in the business the oil problem has been a serious problem because drilling rigs for example are a part of this overall program what we are trying to do in this amendment is just to say that the loan activity that is currently reported to omb and to the treasuryapproved credit agencies not only be supplied with information in regard to loan activity but also in regard to delinquent debt activity what we are really trying to do is in a comprehensive manner have a handful of credit and management agencies or entities both in and out of the federal

documented vessels of the united states it will affect certain types of fishing vessel operations and the operation of the larger commercial freighters and tankers it makes no changes to the existing citizenship requirements for crewmembers of yachts offshore supply vessels mobile offshore drilling units and numerous other types of fishing vessel operations in 1985 the coast guard ruled that only the master of a unitedstates flag vessel must be a unitedstates citizen when a vessel is on a foreign voyage and does not call at a unitedstates port i have a problem with this administrative ruling since i believe congress has never intended that large unitedstates flag vessels engaged in commerce in the foreign trades should be manned with less than adequate citizen personnel be that as it may my amendment would eliminate this socalled foreign voyage exception for certain unitedstates vessels in all but limited circumstances while the kuwaiti tanker situation is the catalyst for review of the foreign voyage exception i am not passing judgment on the general policy of reflagging foreign vessels so they may have unitedstates military protection my concern is strictly unitedstates maritime policy the merchant marine act of 1936 mandates that we foster the growth and development of a unitedstates merchant marineand that we have sufficient ships manned with trained and efficient citizen personnel i am concerned that such a broad reading by the coast guard of the applicable manning statute could have disastrous effects on maritime labor and the maritime industry already beset with monstrous problems citizenship manning laws for unitedstates vessels were first enunciated in 1792 all the officers of unitedstates vessels were required to be unitedstates citizens the provision allowing foreign seamen to replace unitedstates citizen crewmembers below the grade of master was first permitted by the act of june 26 1884 that provision was restated when the manning laws were codified in 1985 the 1884 act included this provision to make unitedstates laws more flexible and to improve the competitiveness of unitedstates shipping i suspect that this replacement provision was also necessitatedat least in partby the state of world travel in 1884 today we can transport replacements by air within a day in 1884 slow communications and slower transportation methods presented quite another situation the requirement that 75 percent of the crew be unitedstates citizens upon departure from a unitedstates port was added in the 1936 act the overall purpose was to improve the personnel on our ships and maintain discipline and control over them this amendment would require that all officers and unlicensed seamen on unitedstates flag vessels must be unitedstates citizenswhatever the port of departure the amendment also gives the secretary of transportation the authority to modify the unitedstates citizen complement of certain offshore supply vessels and mobile offshore drilling unitsand it continues the secretarys authority to reduce the citizen complement when qualified citizens are not available finally it makes it quite clear that a foreign seaman may replace a unitedstates seaman on a foreign voyage when the vessel is deprived of the services of an individual however the bill provides that this replacement authority is temporary a unitedstates citizen replacement is mandated as soon as the vessel returns to any port at which in the most expeditious manner a unitedstates citizen can be obtained simply put whenever a vacancy occurs on a unitedstates ship on a foreign voyage because of illness death dismissal or other similar emergency a foreign seaman can fill that vacancytemporarily this should eliminate any misconception that unitedstates citizen crews can be supplanted by foreign crews because its cheaper or because the owner wishes it this amendment would eliminate the authority that permits foreign vessels to be documented as unitedstates vessels and carry foreign national crews in the future should similar national security needs arise the president has at his disposal the statutory authority to respond as he deems necessary for now i am content to correct this loophole in our laws to assure that under ordinary circumstances and as far as practicable unitedstates citizens man unitedstates ships i believe it is in the national interest and deserves your support"]]}
