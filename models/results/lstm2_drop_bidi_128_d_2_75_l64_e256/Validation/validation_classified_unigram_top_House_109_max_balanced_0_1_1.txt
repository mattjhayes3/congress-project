of 2005 this bill will provide muchneeded flexibility and reghlatory relief to help the students schools workers families and corhmunities affected by hurricanes katrina and rita while the recovery effort on the gulf coast is well underway there is still a significant amount of work yet to be done in my home state of louisiana educational services at all levels have been severely impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita uifortunately we are finding the bureaucratic inefficiencies and red tape have a tendency to slow the efforts of individuals and communities working to rebuild entire communities have been uprooted by these unprecedented natural disasters and we must workto ensure that bureaucratic red tape does not hamper efforts to restore the region accordingly i have introduced the hurricane regulatory relief act of 2005 to provide commonsense solutions and flexibility that will help affected students schools workers families and communities bypass the bureaucracy and move forward with the recovery effort in general this bill eases restrictions and provides flexibility for various programs and initiatives administered by the departments of education health and human services and finally the department of labor for an unlimited period of time h r 3975 increases flexibility for elementary and secondary schools and teachers provides assistance for higher education students expands access to child care and early childhood education promotes communitybased services and addresses issues related to workers displaced by the hurricanes h r 3975 would ease some financial requirements such as maintenance of effort and supplement not supplant funding requirements for k12 schools in the impacted gulf coast region easing these requirements would ensure states and schools can serve students effectively with the resources available the bill also gives these schools more time with regard to special education evaluations and reporting requirements by extending but not waiving these deadlines states and schools would have the flexibility they need to ensure the affected students will have access to the services they need to address the specific needs of teachers the hurricaneregulatory relief act would expand opportunities for quality teachers to serve displaced students for 1 year the bill would allow teachers that meet the highly qualified standard in an affected state to be considered highly qualified in other states that are serving large numbers of displaced tudents where they may be temporarily teaching the bill would also help special education teachers by expanding the paperwork reduction pilot program under the disabilities education act to include states affected by the hurricanes to assist higher education students h r 3975 would expand outreach efforts to ensure disadvantaged students and families have access to information about financial aid that may be available as they pursue higher education the bill requires colleges and universities to adjust financial aid award calculations through the expected family contribution taking into account changes in families financial circumstances caused by the hurricanes h r 3975 would also encourage institutions of higher education to ease the process for displaced students to transfer the academic credits they have earned and to continue their studies as the region rebuilds with regard to child care services and early childhood education the hurricane regulatory relief act would ease federal requirements for state administration of the child care and development block grant to give af fected families easier access to child care service additionally h r 3975 would engure that displaced children have access to head start by requiring the department of health and human services to provide additional guidance technical assistance flexibility and resources to affected areas to ensure children impacted by thte hurricanes will have access to the educational and comprehensive services provided through the head start program to promote communitybased services h r 3975 would provide additional flexibility within the community services block grant program by allowing a state to send a portion of its discretionary funds to a state directly affected by the hurricanes the hurricane regulatory relief act also includes several modest but important provisions to provide greater flexibility to those in need and to ensure that bureaucratic red tape does not impede relief and recovery efforts so that those who may need to are able to obtain loans or distributions from their pension plans such as 401 k s the bill provides new authority to supplement the secretary of labors existing authority under section 518 of erisa by authorizing the secretary to waive suspend or grant an exemption from any provision of erisa or regulation issued under the act if the secretary determines that doing so would facilitate the distribution or loan of individual account plan assets to participants and beneficiaries affected by hurricanes katrina or rita this commonsense provision makes clear that compliance with the terms of a waiver suspension or exemption would safeguard a person from liability regarding any action or omission covered under them in addition to speed and facilitate recovery efforts while maintaining important safety protections for workers engaged in reconstruction the hurricane regulatory relief act includes several amendments to the occupational safety and health act first the bill expressly provides that the secretary of labor may utilize the services of volunteers to assist in the recovery effort a practice often impossible under current law second the legislation authorizes the secretary to use osha funds to purchase and distribute equipment and supplies to public and private entities assisting in hurricanerelated recovery finally the bill waives current law matching requirements for certain grants so that states that maintain their own occupational safety and health system may contribute supplieg and assistance in relief efforts the hurricane regulatory relief act provides flexibility and regulatory relief to help students schools workers families and communities affected by hurricanes katrina and rita this bill is narrowly tailored and makes commonsense changes to these various statutes for a imited amount of time so we can help reduce many burdensome bureaucratic proiesses that are associated with our relief efforts as former president of the university of louisiana system

congress recognized the upper section of the farmingtona 14 milelong stretch that runs from the base of the goodwin dam in hartland to the downstream border of canton and new hartford as wild and

regrettably salmon brook a major tributary and the lower farmington that runs 40 miles from canton to its confluence with the connecticut river in windsor do not share the same federal protection

years ellington is home to the 147th air national guard wing texas air national guard wing houston is the fourth largest city in our nation it is our home and has a huge petrochemical complex that accounts for nearly half of the nations base petrochemical production the houston ship channel in the port of houston handled more foreign tonnage than any other port we have the texas medical center and nasas johnson space center one of the most vulnerable targets in the area is the petrochemical complex along with these other assets yet the base closure commission on a close vote decided to close ellington now what they are doing is they are saying that we are going to provide service from san antonio texas the problem is that is 23 minutes away as we know an airborne attack on a refinery complex could seriously disrupt our nations energy supply causing major nationwide economic impacts an attack on a chemical plant could result in a hazardous release and thousands of casualties currently our 147th air wing provides air security in the area and the solution from the pentagonis rotating several planes to fly on alert out of ellington which provides a much smaller deterrent than having a full squadron what would happen if we had multiple planes that are attacking different facilities i urge a yes vote on the resolution i rise to express my disapproval with the recommendations made by the defense base realignment and closure commission and to urge my colleagues to support this resolution this is the most illadvised and illtimed round in the history of base

country less prepared to resp6nd to a terrorist attack houston is the fourth largest city in the na tion and is home to a petrochemical complex that accounts for nearly half of the nations base petrochemical production capacity the houston shipping channel and the port of houston handle more foreign tonnage than any other unitedstates port also we have nasas johnson space center and the texas medical center one of the most vulnerable targets in the area and possibly the country is the petrochemical complex a tremendous complex that stretches the length of the houston ship channel and continues along the coast through beaumont texas we have seen in the aftermath of katrina and rita the negative effects caused by disruptions in our oil supply and refining capacity and leaving this area unprotected is leaving the door open to a terrorist attack on this critical infrastructure the port of houston is the second largest petrochemical complex in the world and the largest in the western hemisphere which produces over 35 percent of the nations gasoline at a great many refineries numerous chemical plants also line the channel producing a number of volatile compounds according to the unitedstates coast guard 7 600 deep draft vessels arrive each year and 60 percent of those ships carry sensitive oil chemical cargos an airborne attack on the refinery chemical complex could seriously disrupt the nations energy supply causing major nationwide economic impacts an attack on a chemical plant could result in a hazardous release with thousands of casualties currently the 147th fighter wing of the texas air national guard provides air security in the area and could respond to a threat on the complex or at the port in minutes because of the close proximity rotating several planes to fly on alert out of ellington provides a much smaller deterrent thanaving a full squadron permanently stationed there and would not provide enough planes to respond to multiple attacks on multiple targets in the area meanwhile the closest full squadron would be in san antonio and would take approximately 23 minutes longer to respond to a threat than the f16s at ellington can currently provide in addition to providing security for the houston area the 147th is capable of providing precision strikes close air support offensive counter air defensive counter air and suppression of

the possible creation of any hazardous byprodiicts this technique of considering not only the process in which products are produced but also the environment in which they are created is the basic definition of green chemistry it is a method of designing chemical products and processes that at the very least reduce the use or generation of hazardous substances green chemistry represents an evergrowing field of science that is demonstrating much promise this legislation gives congress the opportunity to support these important efforts by encouraging additional research and enhanced collaboration i want to take a moment to outline several reasons why i believe my colleagues should support this legislation the first is the simple fact that preventing pollution and waste from the start of a design process is often cheaper than cleaning it up later developing new products and processes are an integral component of a variety of industries industries that span fabrics to fuel cells and the innovation created by this enhanced research will subsequently spur economic growth since the heart of green chemistry is design processes that utilize as many benign materials as possible as well as designing them to be conducted at or near room temperature and pressure working conditions and safety for our employees can be vastly improved unfortunately despite all the promise of green chemistry the federal government invests very little in this area this legislation allows coordination of federal green chemistry research and development within several federal agencies such as the national science foundation the environmental protection agency the national institute of standards and technology and the department of energy h r 1215 will encourage universities and academic institutions as mr wu just mentioned to train future workers in this exciting technology this coordinated program will support research and development grants for partnerships between universities industry and nonprofits it will also promote education through curriculum development and fellowships that will collect and disseminate information about green chemistry finally and most importantly h r 1215 is a fiscally responsible piece of legislation in step with the current reality of our budgetary constraints this legislation funds these programs by obtaining sums already authorized to the abovementioned agencies it does not authorize the expenditure of any new money let me say that again this legislation does notappropriate new funds but rather refocuses the budget of these agencies chemical companies pharmaceutical corporations carpet and rug manufacturers and biotechnology businesses have endorsed h r 1215 showing a broad range of support for the merits of this legislation all of these companies and corporations realize the advancement of green chemistry is a positive not only for their businesses but also our countrys environment our economy and our nations health i encourage my colleagues to vote for this innovative insightful and responsible piece of legislation that will show the american public that congress and the business community are committed to preserving our nations environment mr wu i have no further requests for time and i yield back the balance of my time"], [9.617209434509277e-05, 0.4999038279056549, 1, "this weekend the portland oregonian reported a troubling story of an 18yearold high school student with autism in my district who despite his disability was recruited into the army as a cavalry scout over the strong objection of his parents and in violation of military rules to place somebody with his disability in a combat role would create an entirely unnecessary risk of harm not just to him but other members of his unit who would have to rely on him i have written to the secretary of defense calling for an investigation in this case which does not appear to be an isolated incident accusations of recruitment abuse are at record levels as recruiters face extreme pressure to meet enlistment targets and quotas i am concerned that the military has created a situation where recruiters are pressured to act in unethical and possible illegal ways in order to successfully fulfill their orders i believe we need a real investigation into the breadth of such requirement practices and that new safeguards must be put in

absolutely fabulous woman and we are so fortunate to have her serving in our military andbeing a great role model for all of us i was talking earlier when congressman gohmert came in and i yielded time to him about the fact that in so many of these things that we have ac complished with the republican leadership in this congress to make sure that we thwart terrorists who want to come here who want to do the kinds of things that were done on 9 11 2001 in so many of those ways we have had to fight the democrats at every step of the way they have been opposed to almost every effort that we have made here the patriot act the border security bills over and over and over again they have said no their answer to fighting the war on terror is to withdraw from iraq take our troops out put them somewhere else in the middle east but get out of iraq they talk out of both sides of their mouths they say on the one hand the minority leader says okay all the damage that osama bin laden can do he did 5 years ago she criticizes the president for not having enough forces in afghanistan to catch osama bin laden and then she says well it wouldnt matter if we caught him anyway we would not be any safer if we caught him so over and over and over again we get mixed signals from the democrats that gives comfort and aid to our enemy they see that happening and they think boy if there is a chance that the democrats could take control then we wouldnt have to worry about being pursued we wouldnt have to worry about what the congress is going to try to do to us in conjunction with what the administration is doing we can just sit back and wait for them for the democrats to get in control nothing could be worse for our country than for them to be put in control and to withdraw our troops from iraq where we are making tremendous progress on helping those people live in a free country that is what they want i had the great opportunity to go to iraq in july just at the end of our session in july and the iraqi people said h7338 co to us we are so grateful to you for bringing freedom to us we are so grateful dont leavetoo soon we are committed to a democracy we are committed to maintaining freedom here in this country please dont go away before we can get our feet on the ground this is the first chance we have had to have freedom in the history of this country and we want it and we are going to have it and as you read about what is happening in the country and you see that while there are these militias out there they are not attacking the government of the country they are attacking each other there are sunnis going against shias shias going against sunnis but none of them are attacking the government of iraqbecause they all have a vested interest in keeping that government going and that is very very important but you never read about that it makes it look like these people are all attacking the government but they are not doing it president maliki i think has done a wonderful job offorming a government that can gain the support of the three major groups in iraq and so we are seeing tremendous progress there even though we see the insurgents and even though we see the ieds and even though there has been horrible loss of life it is not directed at bringing down the government there is a fabulous article in the national review dated today as a matter of fact about the importance of that and i would commend it to people to read it about why the government is strengthening there in iraq and how it is strengthening and why things are going well there instead of going badly as the popular press would have you believe so we have to keep fighting and we have to fight this war on terror and improve our national security on all the fronts that we have before us and i want to talk a little bit about a couple of episodes that happened last week that i think show the american people again how much we are at war and what a dangerous place this world still is the president reminds us periodically about it and again as we go about our daytoday activities it is difficult to believe that we are at war even though the news media makes it sound as horrific as they possibly can because they want to undermine what we are doing to improve our national security and they want to undermine the work of this republican congress and this republican president and i want to point out what happened last week with two people who came to this country to appear at the united nations and talk at the united nations and condemn this country for what we are doing we dealt with hearing president chavez and the president of iran ahmadinejad they both made just absolutely outrageous speeches on the floor of the united nations and it is
