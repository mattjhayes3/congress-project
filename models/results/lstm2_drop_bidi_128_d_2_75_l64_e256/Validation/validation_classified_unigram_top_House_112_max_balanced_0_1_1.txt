sector job creation and what we need to do to get our country back on the path to prosperity and job growth i had a jobs conference in the second congressional district my district down in arkansas in little rock a couple of weeks ago we held it at the clinton library it really was an extension of the 25 or so town halls that ive had this year in that we talked a lot about jobs and i thought that a jobs conference would be a good idea because who better to ask about job creation than job creators so we had five panels over 60 panelists and i wanted to hear from the job creators in the second congressional district i asked them two main questions what are the obstacles that you face in creating jobs and what opportunities do you see as i indicated earlier this was really an extension of what ive been talking to constituents about for the 9 months ive been in office and even before that i expected i would hear answers to those questions consistent with what i have heard in town halls in meetings in my office and throughout the year and i wasnt surprised what i heard from the over 60 panelists that gathered at the clinton library in little rock a couple of weeks ago what i heard was uncertainty is the number one obstacle to job creation in this countryuncertainty now ive heard that word used a lot since ive been here i heard it a lot last year when i was traveling around my district before i ever came to congress and it was pretty clear has been pretty clear to me and still is that uncertainty is the biggest problem we face the job creators that gathered in little rock at the jobs conference were from the manufacturing industry energy industry health care retail financial services aerospace infrastructure construction real estate you name it agriculture we had folks from all across the spectrum and they all indicated that uncertainty is the biggest obstacle to job creation what kind of uncertainty were they talking about well the number one type of uncertainty cited by job creators was regulatory uncertainty they indicated at the conference this jobs conference that number one in many instances they know new regulations are coming but they have no idea what theyre going to be so they have no idea whether theyre going to be able to comply with those by spending a little extra money no extra money or a whole lot theyre also concerned about regulations that are floated theyre floated out by the agencies as a potential regulation that may or may not be implemented and those sorts of regulations give these job creators great pause because they dont know whether theyre going to have to comply with them and its not just one agency and its not just one industry i will say that the epas name came up more than any other the job creators made it very clear that there are a number of regulations coming out of the federal agencies that they are concerned about and the epa has issued a number of regulations and some that are yet to be enacted that these job creators were very concerned about i heard from the panelists the common theme that theyre not against regulations weve always had regulations at least since ive been around and were going to continue to have regulations and we need reasonable regulations to keep our water and air clean i have a 4yearold and a 19monthold and i want them to have a clean and safe environment but were not talking about just regulations reasonable regulations were talking about excessive overly burdensome regulations that in some cases require such drastic steps to comply that they just run people out of business weve dealt with a lot of those here in the house trying to reverse some of the stuff coming out of the administration i heard from our energy industry the energy corporations and the electric cooperativessome of the panelists represented those companiesand they indicated if some of the epa rules are implemented as they have been proposed they could result in the shutting down of several power plants in arkansas with a potential impact of raising energy costs 25 percent now these same panelists said look were not necessarily against this sort of regulation the sort of regulation theyre referring to but the time frame for compliance is so short that theres no way its almost humanly impossible for them to comply with some of the epas mandates so we heard a lot about the epa but not just the epa hhs the department of labor many other agencies here in washington put out regulations often with no or little regard to the impact those regulations are going to have on the folks back in my district and around the country so regulatory uncertainty was specifically identified as an obstacle to job creation in this country in addition to regulatory uncertainty theres uncertainty over the health care law is the health care law even going to be implemented or not certainly i voted to repeal the health care law that passed in the last congress i think we need health care reform but not the health care reform we got now the courts are looking at the health care law and theres a good chance in some folks opinion and my opinion that the supreme court might strike the individual mandate portion of the presidents health care law the health care law that we have now so theres a lot of uncertainty surrounding that theres also uncertainty over our fiscal situation the president had a perfect opportunity to lead after his bipartisan debt commission came out with some recommendations i dont agree with all of them but it was a good place to start but instead right after they came out with their recommendations late last year early this year the president came out with his budgetno reform of medicare to save it no reform of social security to save it no reform of medicaid just keep on spending so we missed an opportunity there but the debt is a part of that uncertainty the debt impacts our currency valuation and it impacts our markets you dont have to look far just look at whats going on in europe its sort of like youre looking in a crystal ball and whats going on in europe is potentiallynot identicalbut potentially in some regards our future thats where were headedmore uncertainty so it was very clear after listening to all of these job creators that the problem is not that the federal government hasnt spent enough money weve spent 1 trillion on the last stimulus at a cost of about 300 000 per job discretionary spending has gone up 84 percent under this administration i dont think in fact i know that spending is not the problem its the uncertainty that the job creators addressed so what were going to talk about here tonight is what weve been doing for the last 9 months to address the uncertainty on regulations with regard to the debt and our spending and with regard to our tax code so that we can remain competitive what have we been doing here in this body in the majority in the house to address the uncertainty that i think beyond dispute is the biggest obstacle to job creation in this country and im citing the job creators of my district weve been doing a whole lot over the last 10 months we passed a lot of legislation i think weve had about 800 votes unfortunately a lot of those good ideas are stacking up like cordwood over in the unitedstates senate we pass it send it down to them and they stack it up thats the way its worked for the last 10 months or so i am happy to be joined by my colleagues here i thought wed talk a little bit about the different things that we passed that the american people would have heard a lot more about if they had been acted upon and become law but most folks dont hear a lot about them because they go down to the other end of the building and they just sit there like that little bill sitting on capitol hill that some of us grew up with as a cartoon its just a bill its not a law i am happy to have my friends join me here tonight on the floor to talk about jobs and what weve been doing in the house over the last 10 months i yield to the gentleman from new york"], [0.0009380329283885658, 0.0009380329283885658, 0, "we are living in interesting times as i understand it thats a bit of a chinese curse may you live in interesting times well were here not exactly as perhaps the founders would have hoped where we would have an executive branch that just declares without consulting congress that hes going to commit american military to an action without knowing really who hes helping in libya without knowing exactly whats going to happen once we finish helping them and without knowing just how much were going to suffer and just how much our closest allies like israel are going to suffer after this president unilaterally without consulting congress commits our most valuable asset american lives not to mention the treasury and american equipment for those who have ears and those who have eyes they understand that when the president says oh but were not to worry eventually well turn it over to nato and then has a grandiose announcement were turning it over to nato that actually the united states military is 65 percent of natos military because theres supposed to be a regular order to things and in fact republicans ran last year saying were going to get back to regular order one of the things we went through for the preceding 4 years with the democratic majority and speaker pelosi in charge was the democratic majority came to the house floor over and over with bills that had not gone through committee process and then they were brought to the floor with no opportunity to make any amendments whatsoever well one of the things we have done this year weve had lots of amendments weve had an incredibly open process on the floor compared to what had happened the preceding 4 years when there were more closed rules than there had been in the history of the country meaning no input basically shutting out almost half of america that republicans represented it was our way and no highway thats not the way regular order was supposed to go and we were assured by our own leadership of course that once we had the majority it was back to regular order and then over and over big things had to be dealt with not that they couldnt have been foreseen it could be reasonably foreseen that a continuing resolution was going to have to occur and lo and behold it came upon us in the spring as if it had never been contemplated and we were told there was no time for regular order on these things we just have to do it cant have amendments cant cut off funding for obamacare even though we cut off funding for some other things that otherwise would be considered legislating but since it was part of the bill as it came directly from committee we were told it was okay so the rules committee waived any point of order objections now thats inside baseball but the bottom line is even though we have done a better job of allowing amendments here on the floor we still havent gotten back to regular order we have gone from one crisis to another crisis and have had to tell america gee this is another crisis so we dont have time to go through regular order as i understand it tomorrow most likely possibly friday were going to have a balanced budget amendment brought to the floor it was part of the debt ceiling agreement that was negotiated the end of july the end of the summer session before the august recess we were going to have a vote on a balanced budget amendment but there was no specification as to what balanced budget amendment it would be well along the lines of the socalled regular order we have had a balanced budget amendment weve had hearings on it weve had it marked up out of subcommittee committee and it came to the full judiciary committee and we had a long protracted markup in other words markup is simply the hearing where anybody can bring any amendment and we have debate full debate and anybody on the committee who has any amendment they want to bring to that bill they can bring it to the bill thats regular order we had that in committee on the balanced budget amendment and our good friend from virginia who has been such a longsuffering valiant warrior for a balanced budget amendment it was his bill house joint resolution 1 i had an amendment to that resolution that actually changed the cap on spending from 20 percent of gross domestic product to a cap of 18 percent of the gross domestic product and that amendment passed thats regular order thats how you do it some of us had amendments that didnt get passed but we still had the chance to bring them to speak on them debate on them have every other member on the committee who wished to speak on every amendment be heard those things make for long drawnout hearings and thats what we had thats called regular order thats because everybody who is involved can have input and thats what we had after that long protracted process we voted out of committee affirmatively bringing out of committee voting out of committee with a majority of those on the committee voting for the ultimate product after that long arduous debate and voting process we voted out of committee a balanced budget amendment now im given to understand the rules committee has taken up a different balanced budget amendment and were told we didnt need to go through regular order for that were bringing a balanced budget amendment that did not come out of committee and that was not voted out of committee and gee whiz it reminds me a great deal of the outlandish hearings that the energy and commerce committee had when they came forth with a 1 000page health care bill in the last congress and there was a lot of stronghandedness that brought that bill out of committee and it was clear from the polls that that was not what america wanted but then by the time speaker pelosi leader reid down the hall and president obama had their say that 1 000page bill that was voted out of committee turned into ultimately a 2 000page bill and that came to the floor not under regular order because it just appeared nobody knew who had written it but when we took the majority we were going to do better america would be able to see the debates listen to the debates see who was taking what position see who was pushing what amendments see what got voted out of committee and would have some confidence that that would be what would come to the floor well this week were going to take up a balanced budget amendment that didnt come out of committee but were told weve got to vote for it because its another crisis weve got to it doesnt have a spending cap on it not even the 20 percent of gdp that was amended down to 18 percentnone of that regular order would mean that we bring something to the floor that was voted out of committee at some point we have got to get back to regular order which was promised to the american people if they would put us back in charge and its good politically for both parties because each side gets to show in committee and here on the floor what amendments theyre pushing for they pushed for them in committee and pushed for them here on the floor so by the time a law gets passed its been fully debated and talked about that was one of the problems with the last majority they were shoving bills down our throats down americas throats without any real debate and thats how you could get a comment from a speaker like gee weve got to pass the bill to find out whats in it thats because it never went through a subcommittee process a committee process came to the floor without full and open amendment debates no we just bypassed all that and one of the things that has hurt this country and has hurt this congress is we havent gotten back to regular order like we were supposed to weve done a lot better a whole lot better because of all the amendment debate but we havent gotten back to regular order so were going to bring a balanced budget amendment to the floor thats different from the one that was fully debated have a full opportunity for amendment at committee but were not going to have that opportunity on the floor no sir not going to have it were told we cant have a spending cap in the one were going to have on the floor why well not because the committee voted it downthey didnt not because the body voted not to have it here in congress but because were told that what came out of committee cannot be what comes to the floor i recall people previously saying that regular order makes for better law and allows the house to work its will well how is it that were not going to be taking up the balanced budget amendment that came out of committee thats regular order thats the house working its will what staff member decided that we werent going to get to have a spending cap that we could debate and vote on we know that staff members had a lot to do with obamacare or the presidents health care bill because theres a provision in there that exempted the speakers staff from having to be under obamacare when all the rest of us were going to have to be under it including members so you kind of figure they must have staff writing that one well what staff member decided that we couldnt bring to the floor the balanced budget amendment that came through regular order out of committee that balanced budget amendment was fully debated a full opportunity to amend in committee but regular order means we would have that same opportunity with the whole body here well who was it a staff member who was it that just decided we cant do what the body decided was the will of the committee and the will of the house who intervened i really dont know the right thing to do would be to bring the balanced budget amendment with the spending cap now there were all kinds of amendments addressing the spending cap some folks didnt want it they lost there was the provision for a supermajority to raise taxes on that bill that was voted out of committee well thats not in the balanced budget amendment why i dont know why were told were bringing to the floor a balanced budget amendment that appeared and we didnt have anything to do with bringing it out of committee we were told that weve got to pass this one because its the only one that has a chance to pass even though the senate says theyre going to bring it down even though weve got democratic leadership saying theyre going to bring it down if people on the other side of the aisle in the house and the majority in the senate say theyre going to bring it down then why arent we bringing to the floor a balanced budget amendment that a majority voted for and debated and amended and voted down amendments and passed it out to come to the floor in that order how is it that were trying once again in the house as a majority to strive to pass a bill to hit a mark that we think maybe there might be some chance that the senate may pass as well when were told that its not everything we believe in but were not going to get everything we believe in because were going to try to do something the senate will do well if weve been told repeatedly that the democrats are not going to assist that the senate is going to vote it down then why not bring to this floor what we believe in our hearts as a majority ought to be passed its going to make it real confusing a year from now in november for voters when the republican majority in the house is going to have to go back as the founders envisioned and face our constituents and even though we were in the majority we didnt bring to the floor the things that we believed in we brought to the floor things we were hoping maybe the senate would agree to go along with were bringing to the floor whats called a minibus thats going to have some appropriations in it but actually it went through the conference process yet the underlying bill that passed out of the house was not a bill that a majority in the house really thought would be the best it was a bill that we thought maybe the senate would pass so we compromised with ourselves in the majority in the house thinking if we compromised with ourselves in the house that maybe the senate would vote through just what we passed but no they didnt they compromised with us further after we compromised with ourselves trying to hit the mark that we thought they would pass so it goes to conference committee and were further required to compromise with ourselves what was the sense of that and now we have to vote on a bill an appropriations bill where we didnt even start out hitting the mark we thought was best but rather hitting the mark that we thought gee maybe the senate would pass its going to be confusing to voters because were going to say here are the things we believe in next year in november and theyre going to say why didnt you pass that and apparently the response is supposed to be well because we were trying to pass something we thought the senate would pass and the voters are going to respond well what about the principle you told us in november of 2010 you were going to stand on and unless we get back to the regular order in this body were going to be in trouble because we need to be able to show the voters in america we passed in the house what we believed with all our hearts was best for america we were going to cut spending so we cut spending we cut over 4 trillion over 10 years we ought to be able to tell the american public that but instead we have to tell them well no we were trying to hit a mark that wasnt too high because we were hoping the senate would just pass it without the need for a conference thats why it will be confusing to voters well i know youre saying that you believed in those things but thats not what you passed its time to start passing what we as the majority in the house believe is right and force the senate to pass what they think is right the big giveaway spending bills force them to pass those dont come down here and compromise with ourselves and have a spending bill that we thinkeven though it spends more than we think is appropriatewe think gee maybe the senate will go along because that looks to the american public like were just like the democraticcontrolled senate but if we stand firm on principle in this body and we say heres what we believe in heres what went through regular order heres what was passed out of the judiciary committee heres the balanced budget amendment and we took it to the floor and we have wide open amendments wide open debates the american public could see this body at work and we would pass what we believe is right for america and then force the senate to pass what they believe is right for america and not continue to give the democrat majoritywho want to spend like crazyin the senate we keep giving them cover because we wont stand on what we believe and pass that here in the house thats what we ought to be doing and that balanced budget amendment ought to be the one that came out of the judiciary committee it ought to have a spending cap it ought to have a supermajority in order to raise taxes that was on that bill oh it was debated there were efforts to strike that part out there were a lot of amendmentssome to strike things like that out some to put other things in some to make it weak but we fought those off successfully in committee and we came out of committee with a good strong balanced budget amendment and thats what ought to come to the floor not the weakkneed one were going to get because a balanced budget amendment with no cap on spending unfortunately looks like a prescription for spiralingupward taxes because weve seen even with a conservative majority in the house its just tough to cut spending because were told weve got to spend to get the senate to go along with these bills its time to take the tough stands americas in trouble its in big trouble and as we fight these battles it doesnt help to have people jumping on a bandwagon that really wasnt the bandwagon they showed themselves to really believe in previously and by that im talking about secretary panetta secretary of defense he wrote this scathing letter talking about how if the sequestration occurs hundreds of billions are cut from defense it could mean the loss ofi believe it was a couple hundred million of our military which is a little ironic coming from the current secretary of defense because the people on this side of the aisle believe in a strong defense we all believe that it is our number one job to provide for the common defense because if we dont do that all these other things just go away and were overtaken by people that want to bring down our way of life but if you look to what secretary panetta was participating in back in the clinton administration you get a little better look at what really was believed at the time you know weve had president clinton and those touting his time as president claiming gee hes the one president that actually cut the federal workforce no he didnt he cut the military he didnt cut the federal workforce he cut the military thats the only area he cut and we paid a massive price after 9 11 because we had to gear back up because we once again found having a strong defense is important reagan tried to warn us about that he said people dont get attacked because theyre perceived as being too strong they get attacked when people perceive them as being weak and thats how we were perceived but lets see in january of 1993 when nowsecretary of defense panetta started as a part of the clinton administration there were 1 761 481 members of the united states military in july of 1994 secretary panetta started as the chief of staff for president clinton and that continued through january of 1997 so lets take a look from the time secretary panetta started as a part of the clinton administration we went from 1 761 481 members of the military to in january of 97 when he left the clinton administration 1 457 413 members thats a 304 068 drop in members of the military while he was part of the clinton administration seems to fall a little bit on deaf ears when you have a secretary crying about cuts to the military when he presided over a far more draconian cut to that same military when he was in charge or was part of the clinton administration the problem is we cant afford massive cuts to our defense and at the very time theyre okay with that the president goes down to australia and says were going to commit some troops down here too weve got troops this presidents committing all over the place without any regard like in libya or egypt to the outcome of what is being done whats going to happen at the end and were going to pay a severe price we need to stand for a solid defense and if we get back to a regular order in this body where things are voted out of subcommittee after full chance to amend voted out of the full committee with full chance to amend and debate brought to the floor as they come out of committee and fully debated and fully amended here on the floor america will see who stands for what and it will be easier for the voters in the next election and it will be easier for all of us to tell what it is the american voters are wanting because they will have had a clear view of just exactly what theyre getting i really enjoyed mark levins book liberty and tyranny i think it ought to be a textbook let me just finish with this quote from ronald reagan that mark puts in his book how can limited government and fiscal restraint be equated with lack of compassion for the poor how can a tax break that puts a little more money in the weekly paychecks of working people be seen as an attack on the needy since when do we in america believe that our society is made up of two diametrically opposed classes one rich one poor both in a permanent state of conflict and neither able to get ahead except at the expense of the other since when do we in america accept the alien and discredited theory of social and class warfare since when do we in america endorse the politics of envy and division thats what the presidents preaching right now it needs to stop its time to provide for the common defense get back to regular order in this body and the country will be better off for it with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0009849071502685547, 0.9990150928497314, 1, "i yield myself the balance of my time you have to ask how do they come up with this great idea to put this bill on the house floor today under the suspension of the rules this calendar is usually put in place for noncontroversial bills but this is a controversial bill in fact its a bill that never had a single hearing in the energy and commerce committee which has jurisdiction not only would it eliminate national standards it would bar any state standards taking away longstanding state authority to improve efficiency in the absence of federal action and we should have cleaned up the drafting of this bill that eliminates all efficiency standards for fluorescent lighting i oppose this bill first of all on procedural grounds we shouldnt adopt legislation with significant impacts without a single hearing or markup to understand what it does but i strongly oppose this bulb act on substance it would undermine job growth strand investments that have been made to make sure that we meet these new standards waste 12 billion a year on unnecessary electricity bills and increase pollution i dont think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would come to the floor and say why are we requiring new cars to meet tighter emissions standards or tighter pollution standards let the public be able to choose the old ones that polluted more i would be amazed if the colleagues on the other side of the aisle came here and said why should we have more efficient dryers washers and refrigerators we like the old ones that were less efficient this bill is absolutely unnecessary in 2007 the lighting industry and the efficiency advocates reached a consensus on national standards to make light bulbs more efficient and avoid a patchwork of conflicting state standards and effective january 1 of next year these national standards will go into effect so what we have is an attempt to repeal a proposal that was offered by our current chairman of the energy and commerce committee the gentleman from michigan and former congresswoman jane harman it passed on a bipartisan voice vote with members of both sides of the aisle speaking in favor this bill which they want to repeal was signed into law by president george w bush as part of the 2007 energy independence and security act since it was signed into law manufacturers have made millions of dollars in investments to produce more efficient incandescent bulbs not one manufacturer but a number of manufacturers can compete and are competing once they can figure out how to meet these standards and theyre doing it very well the new incandescent bulb looks and works just like the old incandescent bulb in fact we know this to be the case the only difference between this bulb and the old one is that it will last longer cost less over the life of the bulb american families will save an average of 100 a year with the new standards this is particularly welcome in todays tough economy and adds up to a nationwide savings of 12 billion a year these investments are creating new jobs in the united states while most manufacturers moved their production of the old incandescent bulbs overseas years ago research and development and hightechnology manufacturing is now happening here for example there are led facilities now in north carolina california and florida this is a growth industry phillips hired 100 more people at its led facility last year if we repeal this law and enact the socalled bulb act we will repeal standards that are driving this competition and well switch back to a time when unitedstates jobs would return to china and mexico on january 1 2012 we will be able to buy a better incandescent light bulb that looks and feels the same as the old ones you dont have to buy compact fluorescents now you dont have to buy them on january 1 2012 you can buy the better incandescent bulbs or leds neither of which contain mercury thats more choice not less well if this bill had moved under regular order they might have heard at a hearing that the following groups are now opposing this legislation to repeal the law the national electrical manufacturers association the consumers union the consumer federation of america the american lighting association the national association of state energy officials the national association of energy service companies pacific gas and electric company seattle city light johnson controls philips electronics united technologies corporation united steelworkers alliance to save energy national wildlife federation and the environmental defense fund i urge my colleagues to oppose

manufacturing industry opposes hr 2417 a repeal of the standards established in eisa 2007 would strand millions of dollars in investments provide a marketplace advantage to companies who have not made similar investments create regulatory uncertainty and increase energy consumption in the united states lighting manufacturers have invested heavily to comply with the federal incandescent lighting energy conservation standards as well as the standards for fluorescent and metal halide lighting described below section 321 of eisa 2007 established for the firsttime federal efficiency standards on the manufacturing of common light bulbs it requires bulbs to be about 30 more efficient than todays bulbs the standards do not ban incandescent light bulbs the standards apply to production starting january 1 2012 for the 100 watt bulb january 1 2013 for the 75 watt bulb and january 1 2014 for the 60 and 40 watt bulbs eisa permitted california to adopt the federal standards one year earlier consumers will have expanded lighting options that include advanced incandescent compact fluorescent lights cfls and new lighting technologies like lightemitting diodes leds the standards are implemented over several years this will permit an orderly process for the transition both in terms of product manufacturing but also in terms of the consumer education and awareness of the transition and what products they need for their lighting needs just like today no one bulb fits every lighting application or meets every consumer need lighting accounts for about 12 of energy use in homes while individual home usage varies it is estimated that the average household savings associated with this transition is over 100 per year every year going forward overall national energy savings is estimated at 1015 billion per year every year going forward depending on assumptions of usage and what type of technology is selected to replace traditional incandescent section 3 of hr 2417 would repeal all current energy conservation standards for a variety of energy efficient lighting 1 general service fluorescent lamps tubes section 3 would repeal the standards that doe promulgated in 2009

screw base section 3 would repeal the standards that congress adopted in the energy policy act of 2005 3 metal halide lighting it would repeal the standards that congress adopted in energy policy act of 2005 when combined with the eisa repeal language in section 2 for incandescent lighting eisa section 321 and certain incandescent reflector bulbs eisa section 322 hr 2417 would erase all energy conservation standards for lighting products except the standards for fluorescent lamp ballasts and other types of incandescent reflector lamps nema encourages you to vote no on hr 2417 or any other provision that would repeal the incandescent light bulb standards dear representative the house is expected to vote early next week on the bulb act which would repeal energy efficiency standards for light bulbs that were enacted in 2007 we urge you to oppose this legislation there is no ban on incandescent bulbsthey are just getting better as a result of the 2007 law manufacturers are already making a variety of new energy saving bulbs for homes including more efficient incandescent bulbs these bulbs look light and turn on like the bulbs we have been using for decades but are 2833 percent more efficient energy efficient lighting saves consumers money creates jobs and benefits the environment at a time when families are struggling with high energy costs efficient lighting will save the average american family around 100 every year about 12 billion nationwide and save enough energy annually to power all the homes in pennsylvania and tennessee phasingin energy efficient light bulbs

these standards are technologyneutral and manufacturers have already developed more efficient incandescent bulbs that are available and on the market today efficient options that meet the new standard

president of the united states in that speech he envisaged an accord of free trade among the americas he wanted to eliminate all barriers for the free flow of goods and services and products among all of the countries in this hemisphere on october 3 of 2011 president obama sent three trade agreements to capitol hill for consideration it has been a long time i mean 32 years i guess this coming november 6 we will mark the anniversary of president reagan announcing his candidacy for the presidency and of which he envisaged this accord it has been a very very difficult struggle to get here but today marks the first step in this last leg of what as i said has been an extraordinarily lengthy journey towards the passage of our three free trade agreements with colombia panama and south korea for 4 years workers and consumers in the united states and in all three fta countries have waited for the opportunities that these agreements will create republicans and democrats alikeand let me underscore that again republicans and democrats alike have worked very hard to bring us to this point we have done so first and foremost for the sake of job creation and economic growth were regularly hearing discussion on both sides of the aisle about the imperative of creating jobs and getting our economy on track the president of the united states delivered a speech here to a joint session of congress in which he talked about the need to pass his jobs bill this is a very important component of that proposal that the president talked about when he was here so as i hear a great deal of discussion about a lack of willingness on capitol hill to address the presidents jobs bill its not an all or nothing thing we are taking the very very important components that the president has proposed addressing weve worked in a bipartisan way and this measure before us is evidence of that as i said the passage of these agreements will allow us to have an opportunity to create good jobs for union and nonunion americans who are seeking job opportunities together these agreements will give unitedstates workers businesses farmers access to 2 trillion of economic activity and our union and nonunion workers our farmers and people across this country will have access to 97 million consumers in these three countries president obama in his address here made it very clear and has said repeatedly that the independent international trade commission has said that in the coming months we will add a quarter of a million new jobs right here in the united states of americaagain union and nonunion jobs the independent international trade commission has projected that we will see a quarter of a million250 000new jobs for our fellow americans seeking job opportunities i dont need to explain to anyone in this place why this is so critical for our ailing economy but those of us who have joined together to finally pass these agreements are working towards something that is even bigger we are working to restore the bipartisan consensus on the issue of open trade eradicating partisan politics from the debate on global economic liberalization and returning to a bipartisan consensus is essential in our quest to move our economy forward these three agreements are enormously important but as you know very well there is still much work that remains to be done now i understand that the opponents of economic liberalization are very wellintentioned and i dont fault them i will say that as we all know very well were in the midst of deeply troubling economic times its easy we all want to look somewhere to point the finger of blame and trade is a natural target i mean i often argue that i still have constituents in southern california who when they get a hangnail blame the north american free trade agreement trade is a natural target for frustration and anxiety and weve seen that time and time again and i know that there are people who believe that passage of these trade agreements which according to the itc would create 250 000 new jobs right here in the united states of america is in fact a bad thing trade is the wrong target the worldwide marketplace as we all know is a big dynamic and complex operation it offers tremendous opportunity for those who engage and tremendous peril for those who follow the isolationist path those who innovate who aggressively pursue new ideas and new opportunities are able to compete and succeed the unitedstates has proven this time and time again the american entrepreneurial spirit has enabled us to not just succeed but as we all know we are the largest most dynamic economy on the face of the earth these agreements will allow us to reaffirm and strengthen that we all know this mr speaker our country the united states of america is the birthplace of google and facebook of ford and ibm of caterpillar and whirlpool and of cocacola and ebay unfortunately over the last several years while the three free trade agreements have languished the united states of america has stood still weve let countless opportunities pass us by weve let our competitors chip away at our market share if we compete the united states of america wins if we compete we win but what happens when we take ourselves out of the game which has been the case for the last several years weve literally taken ourselves out of the game of breaking down barriers allowing for the free flow of goods and services and capital what happens we lose jobs we lose market share and we lose our competitive edge now im not going to say that we would not have gone through the terrible economic downturn that weve suffered over the past few years if we had several years ago passed these trade agreements negotiations began back in 2004 for these agreements if we had stepped up to the plate i am absolutely convinced that we would have mitigated the pain and suffering that our fellow americans are going through with this ailing economy that we have getting our economy back on track and reasserting our american leadership role in the worldwide marketplace will require far more than simply passing these free trade agreements but its a key and very important step the agreements will open new markets for workers and job creators here in the united states and perhaps even more important it will send a signal to the world that the united states of america is back open for business the united states of america is once again choosing to shape the global marketplace rather than to allow ourselves to be shaped by it because if we dont shape the global marketplace we will continue to be shaped by that global marketplace we will also send a very powerful message to our allies that the united states of america is living up to its commitments now it is utterly shameful that we have forced three close friends of the united statestwo of our own neighbors right here in the americas and one in an extraordinarily strategic regionto wait for 4 long years it is shameful that we have forced these friends and allies who negotiated in good faith with us for these agreements to wait as long as they have one of the things weve observed is that the world has taken note our wouldbe negotiatorsnot only on trade agreements but on other issues as wellour wouldbe trade partners and negotiating partners as i said on issues beyond trade have taken note i dont believe that our credibility will be immediately restored with the passage of these free trade agreements but we will at least begin the process we will begin the process of demonstrating credibility on the part of the united states we will signal that the unitedstates is recommitting itself to its partnerships that our word at the negotiating table can be trusted very sadly over the past several years our partners could come to no other conclusion than that our word cannot be trusted at the negotiating table because of action that was taken here a few years ago rejecting an opportunity for consideration of these agreements this rule puts in place a lengthy debate process during which the tremendous economic and geopolitical benefits of these three trade agreements will be discussed and the misinformation surrounding these agreements will be able to be refuted thats why i think this is a very important debate its vitally important that we have this debate so that the facts can get on the table and the ability to refute specious arguments can be put forward and thats whats going to happen this evening and tomorrow leading up to the votes that we are going to cast this rule provides also for the consideration of trade adjustment assistance a modest program that has helped to build that bipartisan consensus that i have been talking about and i believe is essential to our economic recovery now i dont believe that the taa program is perfect meaningful reforms have been incorporated and most important the passage of trade adjustment assistance will in turn help us not just pass the ftas but it will help us maintain what i have had as a goal going back two decades ago when we put together a trade working group that has had bipartisan participation it will allow us to rebuild the bipartisan consensus that i think is so important that will send a powerful message to the markets to job creators to workers in this country to americans who are seeking job opportunities and it will send a very important message to our allies and we hope future allies throughout this world so i urge my colleagues to come together in a strong bipartisan way and support the rule that will allow us to have a very very rigorous debate on the underlying agreements and trade adjustment assistance with that i reserve the balance of

magnificent piece of legislation a legislative weapon against the overreaching of government this was done in the clinton administration and it was signed into law by that president this weapon hadnt been used but once during the clinton administration and not at all during the three gop years of president bush what its called is the congressional review act this is an act that requires all federal agencies to submit any new major regulation to the united states congress for 60 legislative days prior to its enactment during which time the congress can vote to block these new rules if the congress sees fit with mr obama in the white house and senator reid still throttling back in the senate the congressional review act gives the house the potential to block or at least to expose the outrageous new rules being promulgated on the american people these were done by the entrenched leftists in the federal bureaucracy and they are controversial rules that cost americans jobs if there is one thing that the american people have told us they are most interested in besides the fact that we are running away with spending in this congress its that they want jobs you can do whatever you want to a family but if you give a family a job that family has at least the security of that employment since by that very destructive nature these regulations have the potential rather than to create jobs to destroy jobs they should be seriously looked at by this house of representatives one of the things that people dont understand about how the federal government worksin fact we had this said to us all the timeis you passed x law and its really affecting and hurting my business when in reality the law itself may not do any harm to ones business at all the regulations though promulgated by the authority that has been given rulemaking power on that legislation have the effect of law yet theyre not passed by this congress theyre passed by the various agencies and bureaus of the country when the congress gives them regulatory authority now if you really dont know whats going on here you may ask how important is that well lets just take a look at last year last year the federal government issued a total of 3 316 new rules and regulations which is an average of 13 new rules a day seventyeight of those new rules last year were major rules the definition of a major rule is a rule that may result in having an annual effect on the economy of 100 million or morea major increase in prices or in the cost to the consumer it may have a significant effect on the economy including employment the obamacare bill which was passed by this congress in the last session of congress the health care bill it arguably is the mother of all rule creators the congressional research service reports that obamacare gives federal agencies substantial responsibility and authority to fill in the details of that bill and of that legislation with subsequent regulations there are more than 40 provisions in the health care billthat is called the overhaul billthat requires permits or contemplates federal rulemaking authority just in that one act of congress forty different agencies can create rules that affect the health care of every american citizen this house can fight back on those rules with this congressional review act now what is the congressional review act as i said they filed this with the congress and then for 60 legislative daysand legislative days has a definition a legislative day is a day that this congress is available to act so if the congress recesses for 3 days those 3 days are not counted in the number of days so its not 60 calendar days its 60 legislative days for instance if you look at the last congress rules that were filed last summer last june in fact which would be more than 6 months from the 1st of january those rules are still available for review now how is that possible well between the 1st of june and the end of the year this legislative body was not in legislative session 60 days we had the longest recess in probably the institute of the republic that took place in august because of the political world that the majority saw itself in and the fact that they felt like they needed to have 6 weeks back home to do the politics so the majority gave us the long recess we had a break in the 4th of july week then we came back for 2 weeks then we went back home for campaigning and then we came back after campaigning in december for 2 weeks so in total we didnt reach 60 legislative days but all that counting starts over with a new congress something that most americans dont know is every time we have a new congress everything starts over so when we wrote rules for 2 years ago that governed this body we had to write new rules for this session of congress at the end of this 2year period we will write new rules for the next session of congress because we are requiredyouve heard its a new world every morning well at least for congress its a new world every 2 years because the nature of our very existence is we are the peoples court the house of representatives is the peoples house and the peoples house changes depending on who gets elected every 2 years so now we have started a new 60day period the 60day period the rules that were filed that would be subject to this congressional review act those rules were all filed on the 15th of february because that was the first time that both houses were completely in session and so these things will expire sometime in june after that clock has run then this house can no longer act so the house has right now during this period of time from february to june to act on a lot of regulations this gives us a chance to make a determination this is kind of the congressional review act right here i want to give you some examples of some kind of rules that are available to be dealt with under the congressional review act and will be dealt with under the congressional review act the fcc has proposed rules that would allow the federal government to act as a gatekeeper and prohibit broadband providers from selectively blocking or slowing web traffic these new fcc rules will restrict access to the internet and stall innovation in our country further damaging the economy and hindering job creation most people think the internet works pretty good right now but there are those who think the federal government should intervene in the internet and the agency in the executive branch should have a chance to actually regulate and decide how the internet is going to operate we cant affect the internet worldwide but we can affect the internet in the united states most of us feel that we should not in fact be intruding on the internet this is

was talking to my good friend on the other side of the aisle a democrat greg meeks and greg said that if we would raise taxes put taxes on the table that he would be willing to put cuts and entitlements and other things on the table in an equal measure and i told him that there was no way that we could raise taxes enough to offset the things that really needed to be dealt with we have got to control spending we have got to cut spending we have got to look at the entitlements and the rules and regulations that we have to live by and make dramatic changes in government if were going to balance the budget this year we have reached over 15 trillion in debt 15 trillion that kind of goes right past most people because they cant imagine what a trillion dollars is but 15 trillion just to put it in perspective it took the presidencies of george washington all the way to bill clinton to amass the same amount of debt that president obama has racked up in 32 months now think about that from george washington to bill clinton the amount of money in debt that weve added has been reached in 32 months by president obama we have to get control of spending its absolutely essential otherwise well be in the same shape as many of those countries in europe like greece the presidents solution to the burgeoning problem is to increase taxes as i said so i went through the amount of taxes it would take and what we would have to do to reach the goals that the president talks about now if you raise the taxes on everybody that makes over 250 000 to 100 percentin other words you take every dime that they make 100 percent above 250 000that would yield about 1 4 trillion and that would keep government running for 141 days so if we took all the money that people make over 250 000 you would still only run government for less than half a year if you gave the 400 billion of profits that was reaped by the fortune 500 companies and gave them the same 100 percent tax treatment you could add another 40 days to the amount of time that we could run the government so taxing is not going to solve the problem now herbert hoover when he was president decideda republicanthat the way to help stop the economic tragedy that was about to occur was to raise taxes on businesses and individuals and what happened we ended up with the greatest depression in the history of this country now president obama said the one thing that you dont want to do during a time of recession is raise taxes and yet thats what hes advocating and my democrat colleagues are advocating right now raise taxes during a time of economic recession when people talk about unemployment in this country they say well now its 8 2 percent but if you look at the people who dropped off the unemployment rolls and those who are underemployed the unemployment rate is probably closer to 15 percent so the figures we are getting from the administration are really not that accurate its extremely important that the administration and my democrat colleagues here in the house and especially in the senate take a hard look at where were going the projections are over the next 10 years were going to increase the deficit by at least 1 trillion a year we cannot afford that this country will go completely bankrupt youll see inflation that you wont believe right now the fed is printing money to cover the expenditures that were incurring day after day after day that money theyre using theyre buying bonds with it treasury bonds so that money is not actually being seen in circulation but the fact is that were increasing the debt by printing money at the fed on a daily basis in europe the european central bank is doing the same thing with the euro this country and the rest of the world is heading toward an inflationary problem thats going to be unbelievable now people say in this country right now we havent seen any inflation if you look at the figures that are coming out from the administration inflation last year went up about 1 to 2 percent but theyre including in that figure all the new technologies that are taking place theyre not going to the grocery store i went to the grocery store last week and bought four apples at a cost of almost 5 three tomatoes cost almost 5 if you go to the gas pump todayand my colleague from indiana talked about that just a few minutes ago if you go to the gas pump today its almost 4 for a gallon of gas so the inflation rate on staples on things that we use on a daily basis is probably well over 10 percent maybe even higher than that we dont know but the administration says its only 1 to 2 percent talk to the wives and husbands of people that are really strapped for cash right now and you will find that its costing them a great deal more than that on a daily basis for gasoline food clothes and everything else its extremely important that we get control of spending this is not the time to raise taxes the president has said that himself especially back in 2008 and 2009 yet now they are taking a different tack and saying we need to raise taxes that would be like throwing gasoline on a fire we should not be raising taxes we should be addressing the spending side of the ledger and if we do that we will get this country back on the right track i just got back from europe i took a codel over there to brussels to meet with the finance people in the european union to find out where they are heading and theyre heading in a very difficult direction right now if greece goes belly up its very likely that youre going to see other countries go belly up and we have investments in money market funds and bonds that weve purchased in those countries and if those countries default its going to affect the united states as well so we need to get our house in order so that we dont end up in the same bailiwick that europe is in right now that could cause severe economic problems in this country so ill end by saying its important to get control of spending this is not the time to raise taxes a poll was taken recently by the politico magazine here on capitol hill and 75 percent of the people in this country that were polled said not to raise taxes so the people get it i just hope that the white house will the united states still finds itself in a spending driven debt crisis the national debt has now surpassed an unprecedented 15 trillion dollars house republicans approved a budget that would have put a stop to spending money that we dont have as well as cutting 6 2 trillion dollars more than the presidents budget the democrats blocked it the unitedstates debttogdp ratio is now officially over 100 percent approx 110 percent at the end of 2011 to put the severity of this crisis into perspective it took from the presidencies of george washington to bill clinton to amass the same amount of debt that president obama has racked up in the past 32 months the presidents solution to the burgeoning problem his administrations reckless behavior has caused increase taxes the problem according to the president is simply that the most successful among us simply arent paying their fair share this sentiment has most recently manifested itself in the presidents proposed budget in which he has increased taxes to the tune of 1 5 trillion dollars the simple reality of the situation is that this is nothing more than campaign rhetoric employed in hopes of fomenting class warfare and dividing the american people you cannot tax your way into prosperity we learned this after the 1929 stock market crash when herbert hoover a republican signed legislation to sharply increase taxes on businesses who were seen as the catalyst for the market crash hoovers draconian tax increases fueled by a similar populist outcry heard today ultimately served as the first salvo in a series of policy missteps that would ultimately lead to the great depression of the 1930s keep in mind that even if congress imposed a 100 percent tax taking all earnings above 250 000 per year it would yield 1 4 trillion dollars that would keep the government running for 141 days the problem is there are 224 more days left in the year if we gave the 400 billion dollars of profits reaped by the fortune 500 the 100 percent tax treatment we could fund the government for another 40 days it was not too long ago that president obama himself was quoted as saying you do not raise taxes during a recession if only he had the resolve to heed his own advice the american people also believe that the course of action taken by hoover and endorsed by obama is not the right way forward in a recent poll in the hill newspaper 75 percent of americans polled felt that the most appropriate top tax rate for families earning 250 000 or more is 30 percent or less this would be 5 percent less than what this income group currently pays this is in stark contrast to the 40 percent tax rate that obama and likeminded democrats in the congress have called for to enact in 2013 when one couples this with the expiration of the bush tax cuts we are creating an environment where the entire tax code as we know it will cease to exist if we continue in this vein in 2013 the 8 out of 10 businesses in america that file taxes as individuals will see their tax rate go to 44 8 percent this will effectively kill what little growth our embattled economy has left despite the top marginal tax rate varying between 35 percent and 91 percent since 1960 federal tax collections have been between 15 and 20 percent of the nations gross domestic product every year since 1960 from this we can infer whether taxes are high or low people make adjustments in their economic behavior so as to keep the government tax take at 15 to 20 percent of the gdp history has proven unequivocally that tax rates have always had a greater impact on economic growth than they do on federal revenues it is no longer good enough to kick the can down the road and make this the next congresses or next presidents problem unless we wish to bring the problems of europe to our shores it is incumbent on us to champion responsible spending restraint a repaired safety net reforms

strengthen the premarket review of medical devices improve the agencys ability to appropriately reclassify medical devices or even authorize an independent review of the drug approval process it authorizes changes to the agencys conflict of interest policy for advisory committees but does not strengthen them and it does not reform the medical device clearance process the bill we consider today should not be an end point american consumers need access to products that are safe and effective and numerous independent organizations have found the current system lacking just last year the

a major american company that is rubberstamping basic foundational bigotry against a major american religious group this nation was founded on the principle of religious freedom and this body should never remain silent when a group of people is marginalized just because it worships a different god though weve certainly got more important things to worry about like fixing the economy it has

of which i am a member industry witnesses raised serious concerns about the efficacy of the surface transportation inspection program here are some of the concerns raised at the hearing most surface inspectors have no surface transportation experience or surface security background whatsoever many surface inspectors were promoted from screening passengers at airports these inspectors report to the federal security directors at local airports who commonly also do not possess any surface transportation experience at least one local tsa official indicated he is always looking for things for his inspectors to do to occupy their time most surface inspectors have two things to look for in a typical day whether a transit system is reporting incidents to the tsa and a box is checked on their clipboard and whether there is a security person on duty another box to be checked on a clipboard the work of these inspectors is redundant performed by employees of other agencies such as the department of transportation osha or epa and on and on what they do is ultimately slow down commerce on our nations rails and highways since 2008 tsa has more than doubled the size of the transportation inspection workforce and quadrupled the programs budget yet according to the majority of stakeholders we heard from there has been almost no tangible improvement in security as a result of these investments last year tsas entire surface transportation security budget was 126 million of this amount surface inspectors cost taxpayers 54 million which does not even include headquarters administration oversight and staff associated with the program this means that the surface transportation inspection program which has been labeled as ineffective by a number of freight rail passenger service bus and mass transit agencies is consuming more than 40 percent of the entire surface transportation security budget millions of americans rely on surface transportation every day more than 8 million people use public transportation in new york city alone despite this need less than 2 percent of the tsas nearly 8 billion budget goes toward securing our nations surface transportation systems and a large portion of that limited budget is being squandered on this ineffective inspection program surface transportation security is too important to our national economy and receives too small a portion of homeland security funding to waste a single dollar opponents of this amendment may argue that it will result in federal inspectors being put out of work it will not we are transferring money to implement more productive security measures within tsa the question is simply why should taxpayers especially those who rely on surface transportation every day have to fund a program that has no proven ability to enhance security my amendment today seeks to limit the inspector program budget to 20 million which would substantially reduce its size and allow the saved money to be put forward in other more effective surface programs such as canine detection units particularly at bus and rail stations this amendment strengthens security it addresses concerns raised by the very transit systems the program is designed to protect today i ask you to join me in supporting this measure i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.998801589012146, 0.998801589012146, 0, "i thank

representatives of the people should distribute taxpayer dollars as warranted and needed the lineitem veto would weaken that power shifting budgetary authority to the executive branch and giving the president a power that our founding fathers did not see fit to give to him in fact a previous effort to provide the president a lineitem veto as has been noted was ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court in 1998 two weeks ago during his state of the union address we heard how the president would choose to spend our precious taxpayer dollars the lineitem veto would strengthen the presidents ability to give preference to his spending priorities over those of the congress and the constituents that you represent our founding fathers had seen firsthand what an absolute authority could do when wielding too much influence particularly over spending and taxation and they drafted our constitution accordingly providing for checks and balances to prevent too much power from falling into the hands of one branch of government the executive the framers would surely shake their heads at the idea of transferring this much authority to the executive branch so powerful was this defense of congress role that james madison in federalist paper no 58 stated the power over the purse may in fact be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people for obtaining a redress of every grievance and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure not only does the lineitem veto fly in the face of our constitution and the framers protections but budget experts also doubt its effectiveness as a spending reduction tool look back to congress experience with the lineitem veto under president clinton he wielded this authority to little effect in saving taxpayer dollars in fact congress declared that he misused that authority and overturned nearly half of his cancellations so to summarize the lineitem veto it is a power likely to be abused and not likely to save money in an effort to better this flawed bill to at least improve its chances at having a tangible effect on government spending we offered an amendment in the rules committee that would have made the bill also apply to tax benefits and runaway entitlement spending however that amendment was ruled out of order the amendment wouldnt have made this bill perfect nor would it have solved the constitutional problem but it would have at least increased the potential for achieving actual budget savings nearly 25 years ago

the highly restrictive munitions list as a result worldwide market share for unitedstates made commercial communications satellites dropped from 75 percent to an average of just 44 percent over the past 13 years as a result the aerospace industries association aia estimated last january that unitedstates manufacturers lost 21 billion in satellite revenue from 1999 to 2009 costing about 9 000 direct jobs annually because of treating exports of comsats along with satellite parts and components like military weaponry in addition this congressional overreaction harmed our national security because it hurt our unitedstates space industrial base particularly component manufacturers these firms became less globally competitive because stringent export controls provide a perverse incentive to foreign satellite makers to design out unitedstates parts thus as these unitedstates component makers struggle to sell their product in the commercial marketplace they become less able to meet the national security needs of the unitedstates government a 2011 analysis of the unitedstates space industrial base by the respected tauri group documented that out of 135 unitedstates space hardware manufacturers 28 technology areas are at some risk of disappearing from our shores because of limited suppliers the socalled section 1248 report recently released to congress by the departments of defense and state on the risk assessment of unitedstates space export control policy also documented that 95 7 percent of all export licenses for satellite parts and components in 2011 going to partners and allies were approved with no additional provisos or restrictions four percent were approved with conditions only 0 3 percentor a total of six licenseswas denied these 4 3 percent of applications will still be captured under the new satellite export licensing system proposed by the administration in other words we waste valuable time and resources by processing licenses for

learned over the last 10 years is the importance of having alternative authorizing agencies in fact 32 states have created alternative authorizing agencies including my home state of colorado which has a charter school institute in other states it takes the form of vesting mayors university board of regents or state boards of education as alternative authorizers doing so ensures that bold ideas for charter schools brought forth by parents and grassroots community members are more likely to get a fair shot at being considered if there is an alternative authorizer instead of whats already in the bill which also should be present which is an appeals process an appeals process automatically kind of sets up a kind of adversarial relationship we have that as well in colorado when i served on the state board of education we heard appeals processes so if a district turned down a charter school it was appealed to the state board we could then overrule that district and force them to grant it but it set up a very adversarial relationship what has proven to work better in 32 states that have it is having an alternative authorizer in addition to an appeals process so that districts that simply dont want to be in the charter authorizing business or that refuse to grant any charter schools or dont have an application process for them can simply allow another entity to provide the quality oversight thats needed for a charter school in the district one of the great evolutions of the last 10 years has been the responsibility of charter school authorizers its not simply a charter school that needs to reform its the authorizer the public entity that needs to hold that charter school responsible for the performance of its students in my state of colorado our charter school institute approved 22 charter schools serving 10 000 students in the 6 years that weve had it thats 22 out of about 120 charter schools that exist in the state the state university of new york and the university of indiana in michigan have also approved some of those states most successful charter schools local school boards look at things in a different way sometimes they appropriately consider their districts own financial situation when voting on charter schools but that focus sometimes interferes with their consideration of the greater good and local control quiet quality viable public school choices for parents and students that address the diverse learning needs of their district unreasonable denials by school districts can be appealed in states and thats already one of the provisions of this but from my own experience on the state board of education i know that the appeals process is really less desirable for a number of reasons first of all its only reactive and only addresses the merits of whether a particular school board denial was valid or not its not proactive in terms of developing innovative learning models and supporting the quality development and authorizing practice of charter schools two appeals can address school district delays in approving charter schools theres also a way of kind of killing by delayburying under paperwork unreasonable request after unreasonable request from the school district to the founders of the charter school that ultimately lead to the abandonment of the idea appeals are often limited in scope and criteria and appeals are also a drain on state resources state board of education members time department of education staff time state attorney generals time so while they have their role it really should be a last resort and shouldnt be prioritized as the best practice thats why im proposing to add a priority for multiple charter authorizers again states will be able to determine the best form that that should take i should also point out this is very important for rural areas and small districts it is very very difficult if not impossible for a small district or rural school district to be a quality authorizer in many cases they recognize that and would rather not be in fact in colorado most of the districts that have welcomed the state authorizer and said for the local applicants to apply to them instead of their district are districts that know that they cant engage in a meaningful approval or oversight process by having a statewide entity you allow some scale to the very important business of being an authorizera scale that small and rural districts lack we can empower community members in those districts with the power of school choice and charters by ensuring that there is a multiple authorizer this amendment is supported by the national alliance for public charter schools as well asand very important a newer entity at the national levelthe national association for charter school authorizers which is actually composed of districts and state authorizing agencies both of whom have endorsed this amendment again it simply establishes this as a priority for funding ensuring that this best practice that weve come to learn over the last decade can better be reflected and that hopefully states that havent yet had the chance to look at a way to create an alternative authorizing agency will be able to learn from the states that have under this and do so to ensure that charter schools get a fair hearing prevent the adversarial outcomes that too frequently come from the appeals process and ensure that choice is given meaning in rural school districts and small school districts i urge support of my amendment and i yield back the balance of my time"],
