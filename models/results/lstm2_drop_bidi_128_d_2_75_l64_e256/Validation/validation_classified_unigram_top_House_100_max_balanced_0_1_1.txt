from the paper prepared by paul michael blitz archivist of the heritage society of essex and middle river essex maryland has a long and proud history the first settlers of the area like the rest of america were the indians over 700 susquehannoughs inhabited the area the fierce and warlike susquehannoughs often waged war with the massawomekes or the iroquois captain john smith pounder of the colony of jamestown in virginia sailed up the chesapeake bay in 1608 he was exploring back river and middle river or as he called them smals poynt and willowbyes when he first encountered the susquehannoughs he was very impressed when they prostrated themselves in adoration of the european settlers like the roman empire the susquehannoughs were defeated no not by a neighboring tribe but by smallpox we have evidence that the indians lived in this area because arrowheads were found at coxs point and deep creek which are on display at the heritage society museum in 1634 the colony of maryland was founded by 1658 settlers started moving into the back river neck peninsula one of the early families who settled here were the stansburys the stansbury family was a prominent family who also lived in the patapsco neck area reverend tobias stansbury had a farm located in the patapsco neck it was on this farm where general robert ross was killed during the battle of north point in the war of 1812 another member of the stansbury family elijah stansbury would later become mayor of baltimore in 1659 cecil calvert second lord baltimore granted 420 acres of land along the chesapeake bay to a prominent virginia planter named william ball later william ball would become the greatgreat grandfather of another prominent virginia planter named george washington today the tract of land william ball received is now rocky point golf course the manor house named for ball is ballestone and is open to the public by the 1700s most of what is now essex was made up of land grants in 1736 thomas hines received 261 acres of land called hines purchase this land grant would later become essex the original hines purchase marker is still standing on the corner of mace avenue and franklin avenue industry came to the area in 1744 when the principlo co opened an iron furnace at the head of back river augustine washington and his sons lawrence and george washington had stock in the company a mansion was built for the washington family to stay when they visited the iron furnace later the name was changedto the locust grove ore mine it was in operation from 18451885 during the civil war it made weapons and employed 100 people the locust grove iron furnace built zion evangelical lutheran church for its workers to have a place to worship in the 1800s elijah taylor bought farmland which he called paradise farm this was the first time the area was united under one nameparadise around 1860 james c tutchton and his wife sarah rented paradise farm from jacob taylor later the taylor family decided to have paradise resurveyed in 1909 the taylor land co divided the farm into lots and created the town of essex maryland named after a county in england the taylor land co also donated lots for st johns lutheran church essex methodist church the volunteer fire company and the portable schools essex was a growing community and was called the riqing suburb of the east

of essex and middle river is being restored to its original condition were two of the early landmarks in essex the first house in essex was the schuster house located on the corner of dorsey avenue and taylor avenue some of the streets in essex were named for the taylor family these include taylor avenue franklin avenue and margaret avenue in 1910 the oldest store in essex was opened by henry guttenburger his son john now in his eighties still runs the store in 1915 the vigilant volunteer fire company was formed located at 518 eastern boulevard it was the first firehouse in essex up to that time essex had no fire protection upset by this a group of concerned citizens formed the volunteer fire company because of the growth and development of essex bucket brigades were useless after realizing this the vigilant fire company turned to horse drawn wagons they too became obsolete with the advent of the automobile motorized fire pumps replaced horse drawn wagons the vigilant fire company purchased a 1914 bessmer motorized chassis it had the modern features of two pumps fire hoses and a 40 foot ladder a 35 gallon chemical tank was mounted behind the drivers seat by 1919 there were two paid fire houses in baltimore county one in towsontown the county seat and the other one was in catonsville in that same year essex had paid firemen stationed at the vigilant fire company the volunteer firemen soon became paid firemen and established a building and loan association which exists today in 1920 a new firehouse was built next door to the vigilant building and loan this fire station is now the heritage society museum many people came to essex to visit hollywood park in addition to being an amusement park hollywood park also offered picnic areas swimming fishing and beer

taking out this special order to commemorate and honor the late george c marshall george catlett marshall as the gentleman knows i do not make a habit of signing commemorative legislation because of the cost of such but i think that it is important that we do take time out of our business to join our nation in this important commemoration at a time when america looks for heroes i do not think that we need to invent any i think that we can look in history and find the perfect example of truly a great american hero a man who served his country so admirably and so well i am not a person who looks for heroes but i have one and that is george catlett marshall as a matter of fact i have a portrait of him in my office i have read virtually every book written about marshall and would have to commend to those who read this record or see this on television whether it is moseleys book a hero for our times or the four volumes that pogue has written it is an invaluable lesson it is an experience that i think each of us can share i borrowed the chairmans latest version i have read the first three volumes of pogues biography of marshall i have yet to read this one and i think that i will have many an interesting night reading it the last being the years as secretary of state a documentary of those years as a civilian that george marshall served his nation i believe that george catlett marshall is perhaps the most important person in the 20th century i do not say that lightly because as a student of history as a person who has been extremely interested in american history and in the history of the civilized world i believe thatwe find very few people who have been able to combine the skills and the personality and the devotion to service that george marshall performed and exemplified he was a cadet at vmi which the gentleman in the well has mentioned even though he was a pennsylvanian by birth i think he certainly did claim virginia as home and virginia can be proud of that as well as pennsylvania but the fact is that george marshall was an american he was a person who lived by the highest code of conduct and standards and set i believe an incredible standard of conduct for the military i think that he set a standard of conduct for leaders elected leaders such as ourselves but also for men and women and children throughout the world who can learn from the strengths that this person exhibited those being incredible moral integrity and honesty you read the volumes and the history of george marshall and you find that it was this standard of conduct and this constant standard unflappable consistent always there the standard that you knew that this man was honest in his dealings with you and with the importance of the job that he was performing at the time and that he put everything that he had into that job so it is that level of professionalism that incredible standard that i think we can certainly learn from as a member of the committee on armed services i have also spent time trying to ascertain some of the skills that general marshall had when it came to the running of the army as chief of staff his incredible understanding of organization he was an organizational man par excellence he understood the logistics the role of logistics and if anyone elevated that area of the service and the military it was george marshall he understood that fully and it was because of his incredible organization and his logistical skill that we were able to be victorious i think in world war ii i think a more important quality that he had which has stayed with me after reading so much about george marshall is that he understood people he cared about people whether they were enlisted people within the army or the citizenry of europe or the people whom he served in this country he was able to draw out the potential of those individuals and i think that that is the mark of a true leader he kept his notorious black book where he took notes about the performance of people whom he worked with over the years and he would go to that when trying to find a person to perform a skill or to fill a role wherever it was in the military the army or in american service and with those voluminous notes he was able to draw upon key people and insertthem i think that too was probably a lesson for many of us i recall one instance and again i think this is probably as accurate a portrayal as the fact that he was recognized throughout his military career and he probably had one of the most frustrating tenures as a captain of any of the fivestar generals because after world war i when he was promoted and after the war he was back to the grade of captain he lingered there for some time or before that he lingered there i know it was a frustrating time for him but on one of the promotion slips the story goes that the colonel who was rating him wrote in there under how would you rate the leadership capability of captain marshall and he said i should be so lucky as to serve under him or that he should serve under me so again he was recognized throughout his career i think it can be safely said that general marshall and i guess we always refer to him as general marshall no one ever called him george i think one admiral called him that and that was a rarity because of the stature that this person had and his own sense of professionalism but general marshall knew how to conduct a war but he also and more importantly knew how to preserve the peace and i think that is what led to the marshall plan and the recovery of europe and the basis for nato today and the fact that we have had deterrence and peace since that time was a legacy that general marshall gave to the free world rightfully he was a nobel peace prize winner again he set the standard i think for the citizen soldier and for all of us who are devoted to public service so in conclusion i would again commend my colleague from virginia for his insight and foresight in calling this special order and taking the time at a time when we sometimes question what we are doing in this country and the fact that we have not had a bipartisan

we have a very obvious flaw in the williams bill that must be addressed and that i think certainly is addressed by this amendment i think it is interesting to note that if this house of representatives has gone on record for any one thing or any one subject or any one topic it has been taking action to better the lot and the lives of our elderly people in this country i think to take away as this bill would do the right to see that those persons who care for and administer care to our elderly are not prop~erly investigated would indeed be setting a bad bad precedent here on the floor of the house of representatives further example of how unfair the situafi6n has become mi chairman under the bill as it nov stands a person who is charged a young person who is charged with stealing 3 50 worth of candy from a store can be polygraphed by the police but at the sametime a person who may have a serious record of convictions and the amount of convictions may not have been divulged cannot be polygraphed by the owners of a nursing home it is important to note that let us not take away this valuable investigative tool which should be used in conjunction with not solely for the purpose of determining suitability for a particular job but in conjunction with all other evidence to screen out these people who might not be employable i was gratified last year when the

calling this special order i think that it certainly is something that needs to be discussed prior to the beginning of the confirmation hearings that i under stand will start on september 15 as a number of people have already stated i think there is some significance to the fact that that is a delay of over 70 days i say that is significant because the average over the last 25 nominees has been 18 days with the longest of any of those being 41 days the question i think is why are we seeing this delay i think the answer is fairly obvious it is to give those from the liberal left wing adequate time to marshal their lobbying resources people for the american way which i would categorize as one of those leftwing organizations founded by norman lear has already pledged that it will spend at least a million dollars trying to block this nomination as it spent when it tried to block the nomination of dan manion last year the real question i think is why are we seeing this concerted move to block the nomination of an individual that certainly from credentials ought to be quickly nominated and affirmed and i think the answer has to do with the fact that last year the supreme court had half of its total 81 decisions determined by either a 6 to 3 or5 to 4 vote that comparies to roughly onethird along the same margin line the year preceding that so what is really happening here is that as those individuals that have political views substantially different from the president are seeing their margin of victory on some key issues narrowed they want to apply an entirely different test with respect to this particular nominee there is no other way that you can explain the 180degree reversal of the chairman of the senate judiciary committee the gentleman from delaware when he stated just last year and i am quoting say the administration sends someone up like bork and after our investigation he looks a lot like another scalfa i would have to vote for him and if groups tear

despair it offers them selfrespect and it offers them a chance to reach their potential as human beings when i was governor of the state of maine i took great pride in a demonstration program similar to what is in this conference report we called it the welfare employment education and training program or weet and the point was to help afdc recipients get jobs and it worked that program has helped over 6 000 mainers get jobs and statistics have shown that close to 74 percent of the participants are still working the program has also proved to be cost effective it has actually saved maine money the weet program has cost approximately 9 million to operate since 1982 but it would have cost maine over 16 million if those people had stayed on welfare but the program is much more than numbers it enabled people to get the training and assistance that they needed to work the reality is that people want to work and the government must provide services like job training to help them get jobs the government must try to make the transition from welfare to employment as smooth as possible and the conference report we have before us today does just that this legislation recognizes that single
