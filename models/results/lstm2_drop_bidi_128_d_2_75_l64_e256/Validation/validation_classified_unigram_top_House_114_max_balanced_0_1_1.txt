bondholders will be paid but teachers cops and nurses wont i want to continue today and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente

persistente de los puertorriquehos exigiendo que el congreso cumpla y los puertorriquehlos tienen que indicar lo que esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el pueblo debe decirle a wall street que puerto rico no es una tienda para ser pirateada

about senior hunger i began my visit in the kitchen at the walter salvo elder house where an average of 550 healthy meals are prepared from scratch every weekday for delivery to homebound seniors and disabled residents of hampshire county i had the opportunity to chat with highland valley director allan ouimet and nutrition program director nancy mathers then i helped volunteer driver arthur mongeon pack up the days meals in insulated coolers to keep the food hot this days meal was homemade chicken covered in gravy mashed potatoes green beans cranberry sauce applesauce and milk the food looked and smelled delicious and reminded me of what my grandmother used to make i joined arthur on his normal n1 route making stops at 15 homes in northampton at each stop i had the opportunity to deliver the meal and chat with the residents it was an eyeopening experience and i thoroughly enjoyed hearing peoples stories each meal delivered contains onethird of the daily nutritional recommendations for many individuals the meal they receive from meals on wheels is the only wellbalanced meal they eat all day the individuals who receive these meals are lowincome and often have significant health challenges that make it simply too difficult to prepare a full meal never mind going out to the grocery store to shop one of the most interesting things i learned from my visit is that meals on wheels is so much more than just a meals program people who are homeboundmany who live alonelook forward to the brief daily visits from the volunteers these visits lift their spirits and allow them to socialize and volunteers can check in and see how they are doing because of programs like meals on wheels seniors can stay in their own homes where they are most comfortable and live independently longer when we talk about food insecurity in this country nearly everybody talks about children and we are right to want to do everything we can to end childhood hunger but lost in that narrative is the reality that among the food insecure the rising population is seniors one in twelve seniors in our country is faced with the reality of hunger that is 5 3 million seniors who dont have enough to eat many are living on fixed incomes that often force them to choose between prescriptions and foodor paying their medical bills or heating their homes seniors and the disabled represent about 20 percent of those who receive supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap benefits the average snap benefit for households with seniors is a meager 134 per month unfortunately we also know that eligible elderly households are much less likely to participate in snap than other eligible households many seniors may not realize that they qualify for assistance or they may

mass shooting in the history of the united states of america it is a complicated shooting we understand that it most likely is an act of terror a hate crime of unspeakable proportions there are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse the shooter appeared to have been in some measure on the fbis radar but you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in congress have the capacity to deal with and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destructionwhich should be reserved for war not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic republicand inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others martin luther

five percent of the worlds population 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land the fbi and local law enforcement cant tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice this is an issue of course that has great impact on the african american community homicides

view as a health crisis for the entire country but the thing that is also troublingand we will have time to deal with this tragedyis hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list cant purchase weapons of mass destruction how complicated is that to do but the thing that is striking for many of us in the african american community is that when you look at some of the leading causes of deathheart disease being number one and then of course diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic certain forms of cancer hiv aids infectionmany of these illnesses these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that i represent in central brooklyn in bedfordstuyvesant in east new york in ocean hillbrownsville in canarsie and in the west end of coney island are preventable preventable by better exercise preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many lowincome communities of color have been subjected to resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness preventable by better diet senator booker recently said to many of usand this has stuck with methat more african americans in the united states of america die as a result of drivethroughs not drivebys that is because the diet the access to healthy food is limited the food deserts within which many african americans particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level are forced to reside in are scandalous so we in the congressional black caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful comprehensive fashion i am thankful that back at home in the west end of coney island coney island cathedral one of the most important religious institutions in brooklyn is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists a lack of access to healthy

have minimized the problem some have even ignored the problem in short our response has been inadequate and we have failed to view hunger as a health issue which it is for our nations youngest and most vulnerable our children the negative effects of childhood hunger are pervasive and longlasting so last week i was pleased to see the american academy of pediatrics release its newest policy statement which for the first time recommends that pediatricians screen all children for food insecurity the new recommendations consist of two simple questions for pediatricians to ask parents of young children at their annual well visit to identify and address childhood hunger it also recommends that pediatricians become more familiar with our robust system of antihunger programs at the federal state and local levels when pediatricians know more about these antihunger programs and the resources they provide they will be better prepared to help families in need pediatricians are among the most respected if not the most respected voices on childrens issues and i hope that with the aaps policy statement more people will start paying attention to the devastating effects of childhood hunger on americas future it is shameful that childhood hunger even exists in this country the richest country in the world that one in five children lives in a food insecure household that 17 2 million households in this country struggle with food insecurity that the only reliable healthy meals some kids receive are the ones they get through school breakfasts or lunches their mothers and fathers are forced to skip meals so that their kids can have more to eat because the family simply cannot afford to put enough food on the table the harmful effects of hunger on children are well documented for example children who live in households that are food insecure get sick more often recover more slowly from illness have poorer overall health and are hospitalized more frequently children and adolescents affected by food insecurity are more likely to be iron deficient and preadolescent boys dealing with hunger issues have lower bone density early childhood malnutrition is also tied to conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life lack of adequate healthy food can impair a childs ability to concentrate and perform well in school and is linked to higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems from preschool through adolescence i have personally heard from pediatricians who see kids in the emergency room come in for a common cold that has become much worse because they dont have enough to eat and their immune systems have been compromised stories like these are heartbreaking we know that consistent access to adequate nutritious food is one of the best medicines for growing thriving children childrens health watch a national network of pediatricians and child health professionals found that in comparison to children whose families were eligible but did not receive snap young children whose families received snap were significantly less likely to be at risk of being underweight or experiencing developmental delays if members of congress are not swayed by the moral arguments for ending childhood hunger they ought to be swayed by the economic ones ensuring that our kids have access to enough nutritious food saves money in the form of reduced healthcare costs and helps them become more productive contributors to our economy later in life without our robust federal antihunger programs there would no doubt be more hungry children in this country the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children or wic provides nutritious food and support for children and mothers the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap is our nations premiere antihunger program and helps millions of lowincome families afford to purchase food every month about half of all snap recipients are children and our school breakfast and lunch programs summer meals and child and adult food care programs all provide nutritious meals to children in community childfriendly settings we cant forget about the incredible work our food banks food pantries and other charities do to provide healthy food for lowincome children and their families despite the incredible work that they do charities cannot do it alone the demand is simply too great charities need a strong federal partner to end hunger in this country for a while now i have been urging the white house to convene a white house conference on

many of my colleagues are sure to rush to the floor in the next few hours to pat themselves on the back for accomplishing this marvelous transformational highway bill we should not be popping champagne there is no backslapping deserved while i am encouraged by the fact that in many ways the policy related to surface transportation takes a significant step forward i am deeply discouraged by the phony payfors during the upcoming debate on this legislation you and the american people are going to hear repeatedly that this bill is fully offset and fully paid for essentially that new revenue and savings will keep the cost of this bill from adding to our national debt this is plain and simple not the case most of the offsets are from general fund transfers now it would take a magician of miraculous skill to transfer money out of a fund that has a negative balance of 400 billion if in fact there is money to transfer from an empty fund i might suggest that we instead try to make the fund a bit less empty instead of transferring it to more spending but i digress lets take a look at the payfors one of a long series of phony offsets is selling off oil that is currently owned by the american people in the strategic petroleum reserve while you are stewarding the american peoples money you are supposed to buy low and sell high not the other way around not only are we selling off a public asset at near record low prices we are also counting on getting over double the current market price in order to make all the math work if you can find a buyer to pay 94 per barrel for oil like the authors claim while the market price is 41 i have got a bridge to nowhere to sell you another phony offset is hiring aggressive private contractors to go after people who are delinquent on their federal taxes now listen i am all for collecting all outstanding taxes but what does that have to do with road building if in fact we can collect an additional 2 5 billion by doing this shouldnt that money be put against the 400billion deficit we are facing already why is it an offset that generates its revenue amount over 10 years when the highway bill is only for 5 years what is going to happen in year 6 will all the road building the country needs be completed by then are there not any other roads going to need to be built in year 6 are we not then just going to have to borrow even more money the bill does make a very reasonable point that taxes must be indexed to inflation to keep from losing value every year i found this quite ironic that makes total sense so it is applied to the gas tax right wrong here is my favorite phony payfor the bills authors didnt have the political courage to deal with user fees for drivers but instead are indexing taxes collected by the unitedstates customs service now that is really ironic but that tax is easy to hide from constituents now americans returning from overseas will pay more for them in taxes to pave our roads while people who use the roads simply look on and smile yet there is more there are modifications to royalty payments wow that has got everything to do with roads or how about denying passports to those who have unpaid taxes this is allegedly going to raise 350 million of course that has nothing to do with roads and in fact may not even be possible without all kinds of court trials and cases i know you can sense my

increase the size of government and cost people more and more we have seen this with this doc fix again and again 17 times over the last decade every single year i have served in this body less than a decade that has been the solution to kick the can down the road but today the house will vote on a bipartisan bill to end the cliff for good stop the cycle and most importantly provide stability to the medicare program for the seniors and their doctors this is a big moment for congress and i think we should all realize it the bill before us today will once and for all repeal and replace the flawed medicare physician payment system it will move us away from volumebased care to care based on quality value and accountability everyone knows that we need to reform programs like medicare to save it for the future but for so long nothing has been done in this housethat is until today today marks the first step of what i hope will be many more to save our safety nets from collapse and to ensure it for a future generation these reforms are permanent they are bipartisan and they lay the foundation for a medicare that lasts we wouldnt be here to make all these big reforms without a lot of hard work first i want to thank the doctors caucus there are many times i was in a meeting with frustration wanting to find a solution and the first place to find a solution is policy they spent their time together to find that policy then it was how are we going to pay for it and how are we going to move forward that is where the leadership of chairmen come through in fred upton and paul ryan they not only helped build with the doctors caucus they led their own committees today when this vote is taking place it is going to be different from others people arent going to sit and watch the sides to wonder whether it gets there and how close does it pass people are going to watch how big the overall vote is going to be after this vote today we will go back to our districts we will go back to our districts hopefully in a different thought and a different time that yes we can solve a problem yes we can pick a problem that has lasted over a decade that every congress before it has kicked it down the road but no we found common ground we found the ability to come together to solve something that many believed we could not we hope the senate will see the same value today is a good day but today should not be the last day we should look for the other problemsand there are manyand ways that we can solve them permanently like we will do today"], [0.9656981229782104,

reagan was certainly no warmonger republican or a man eager to go to war president eisenhower one of our greatest military leaders was another peacenik republican he knew of the horrors of war unlike many modern day chickenhawks he famously warned us at the end of his presidency about the dangers of being controlled by a very powerful militaryindustrial complex i think he would be shocked at how far we have gone down the road that he warned us against in his book ikes bluff evan thomas wrote eisenhower would periodically sigh to andy goodpaster his chief of staff god help the nation when it

give us the authority to run other countries as we have been doing in iraq and afghanistaneven making small business loans and training local police forces my republican party was always the party of fiscal conservatism yet with a national debt of over 18 trillion how can we justify continually spending megabillions in religious civil wars between the shia and sunni some people and companies that make money off of an interventionist foreign policy always very quickly fall back on the slur of isolationism but most conservatives believe in trade and tourism and cultural and educational exchanges with other countries and in helping out during humanitarian crises we just dont believe in endless war we are told if we dont support an interventionist foreign policy that this means we dont believe in american exceptionalism but this nation did not become exceptional because we got involved in every little war around the globe it became exceptional because of our great free enterprise system and because we gave our people more individual freedom than any other country i have said in thousands of speeches that we are blessed beyond belief to live in this country and that the united states is

at club for growth have scored that they wanted people to vote yes because they believed as some have said it is about free trade but it is a bit ironic for those who follow politics because on the one hand republicans were being told this will allow us to force the president to keep us apprised to give us notice of what is going on so that we can reign anything in that is not helpful to the country i didnt have that impression of the bill not when reading the tpa not going to the classified setting i mean i did that i read the tpp most of it having been a lawyer and a judge prosecutor done defense a chief justice i have litigated a lot of loopholes there are a lot of loopholes in that tpp there were loopholes in the tpa one of my democratic friends was telling me that he was being told that the whole reason the president came up here is that by passing this trade agreement it is going to allow the president to get his agenda done in the next 18 months without congress being able to stop him some of my democratic friends prefer that congress have more say than that and some were not happy with the proposal at all they also were smart enough to know there are a lot of american jobs that will be lost because of that bill i am not an isolationist i believe in free trade but i dont believe in free rein for a president i am afraid that is what it will do and that is why i had to vote no once again but it passed and now we will see if what some of my democratic friends were told is accurate in that the bill will allow the president to achieve his agenda without republicans being able to stop him it appears that way to me in reading the bills that he has got enough loopholes he can take advantage of plus even without loopholes there is a requirement of notification he was required to notify us before he released anybody from guantanamo he didnt do it he went ahead and released five of the worst murderers in return for a guy who is we are told about to be charged with desertion the president doesnt seem to be bogged down by having to follow the law but i am impressed with my friends who thinkbut yesif we pass one more law that makes him give us notice after 61 2 years of his not keeping us apprised as the law requires this time we think he really really will i am impressed with that kind of optimism even though the old expression here in washington is no matter how cynical you get it is never enough to catch up sometimes i think there is merit to that in any event there is an issue even far more important than trade that is about to hit this country it could create a constitutional crisis of proportions that some of the justices on the supreme court cant imagine i blew up the law this is the law it is not an ethical requirement i mean having been a prosecutor a defenseheck i was even courtappointed to appeal a capital murder conviction i dont know how many here on the floor have appealed a capital murder conviction i begged the judge not to appoint me but he did anyway and when i got into the thousands of pages of records i found out he had not gotten a fair trial i fought for him in the highest court in texas and got the death penalty reversed some clients felt like i was a pretty good lawyer i was told before i went on the bench that i got the only jury verdict against what was then the largest oil company in the world i dont know if it was or is that is what i was told i know something about practicing law and i know something about being a judge i know that with any case in which the public would suspect that i could not be impartial i would have to recuse myself sometimes judges will just recuse themselves so they dont have to make a tough calli never did thatbut there are times when you have such a strong opinion about a matter that you have no business sitting on that case now ethical requirements would insist that a judge conduct his performance as a judge in such a way that it comports with the requirements of the canons of ethics however this isnt an ethical violation that would get you a letter from some bar president or from somebody saying we think you violated the canons of ethics this isnt it this is united states law this is the law of the land this is part a part b goes into some different possibilities when a judge might have to recuse him or herself but it is volume 28 of the united states code section 455 and section a doesnt have any subparts to it like b does b is like i say other examples where the judge might have to recuse himself but a is unequivocal any justice judge or magistrate judge of the united states shall that is a shall disqualify himself generic male or female in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned this is not some model code of ethics this is the united states law no one in the country including on the united states supreme court is supposed to be above the law as we have talked about we have two justices who have performed samesex marriages in fact the article by greg richter may 18 of 2015 is quoting from maureen dowd in her article in which maureen dowd writes regarding justice ginsburg with a sly look and special emphasis on the word constitution justice ginsburg said that she was pronouncing the two men married by the powers vested in her by the constitution of the united states now there is no question that justice ginsburg is biased prejudiced she has her own opinion about this matter she has had her opinion about this that was clear in the first samesex marriage she performed for her not to disqualify herself is a violation of the law of the united states yet we are told that justice ginsburg is not going to recuse herself that she wants to be part of a majority opinion what happens when someone who is disqualified for sitting on a case sits on a case anyway in order to use her partial biased position to bring about a majority opinion it would certainly seem that that would be an illegal act not criminalthis isnt criminal lawbut it is an illegal act for someone to violate this law then of course we also had justice kagan as mentioned in the fall of last year in september of last year in the hill when peter sullivan reported supreme court justice elena kagan officiated a samesex wedding on sunday a court spokeswoman told the associated press the ceremony in maryland for a former law clerk is the first samesex wedding that kagan has performed justice ruth bader ginsburg and retired justice sandra day oconnor have performed samesex weddings in the past gay marriage the article reads has been a divisive topic at the supreme court as it has been elsewhere in the country the article reads the court could decide as early as this month whether to take up the issue again in the coming session this time to consider a more sweeping ruling declaring a right to samesex marriage across the country ginsburg said last week that unless an appeals court allows a gay marriage ban to stand there is no need for us to rush on a supreme court ruling but they took the case up and now we are told they are going to rule by june 30 of this month clearly justice kagan is disqualified she has had a profound opinion it reads in which the impartiality might reasonably be questioned there are different standards of evidence in the law some states use different burdens of proof you can have more likely than not if it is a group like on a jury one more than half if there is a preponderance of the evidence that it is more likely than not then you find that way probable cause is an issue that has an evidentiary requirement it has got to be probably something is likely or has occurred a preponderance of the evidence i mentioned that beyond a reasonable doubt is what most criminal courts have before you can find someone guilty evidence must be beyond a reasonable doubt there are some courts that use a standard called clear and convincing evidence this united states law doesnt use any of those standards it is a very weak threshold before a judge or a justice must disqualify himself he must disqualify himself i hated the fact that justice scalia some years back had to disqualify himself but he had already had an opinion expressed about i believe it was the pledge of allegiance he could not be sure that it wouldnt end up as a 44 decision which meant the ninth circuit decision would stand which struck down under god in the pledge as i recall but he disqualified himself justice scalia followed 28 usc he disqualified himself because his judgmenthis impartialitymight reasonably be questioned it appeared that he was partial that he had an opinion in the case so he disqualified himself that is acting in accordance with the law i keep coming back to this it is a matter of a constitutional crisis when the highest court in the land not merely strikes down and says that their opinion is more important than moses depicted up there in the center point of this room more important than moses depicted in the marble wall over the supreme court holding the ten commandments the supreme court says theirs is more important than the opinions established and stated by jesus christ when he saidand he was quoting mosesthat a man shall leave his mother and father a woman leave her home and the two will come together and be one flesh and what god has joined together let no man put asunder that is the law of god according to moses it is the law of god according to jesus it is tough enough if you have a united states supreme court which back in the 1890s said this is clearly a christian nation despite what any opinions may be the evidence established this country was established as a christian nation the great thing is that if a nation is established on judeochristian beliefs it allows anybody to live here and to function here and to do so without impediment to ones beliefs because one can be an atheist an agnostic a buddhist a muslim you can be any of those things as long as you are not trying to take over the country like some would like to do but otherwise by basing a country on judeochristian beliefs we have provided more freedom for individuals than any nation in the history of the world and yet we may have an ultimate crisis here when a court says our opinion is more important than god if there is one more important than moses more important than jesus our opinion is not only more important than those people but it is the law of the land and it is so important that our opinion count that we are going to violate the law ourselves in order to force our opinionclearly what it isour opinion on the united states of america i dont want anybody to be prejudiced against anybody else i was sick to my stomach this morning hearing about the shooting in charleston south carolina this evil perpetrator killed my brothers and sisters we are brothers and sisters in christ skin color does not matter one bit he killed my brothers and sisters i hope america joins me in mourning i know the people on both sides of this aisle do at our prayer breakfast this morning we prayed and will continue to pray for the families of those who were lost those christians we as christians believe as jesus told the thief beside him this day you will be in paradise with me we believe they are better off than any of us here in the united states or on earth because of their beliefs we believe they are in paradise with jesus himself with the lord but it is the terrible wake they leave behind that is so tragic state senator from all accounts a good man not only a christian brother but a really good man pastor three men six women so our hearts go out to them we dont want anybody to be prejudiced against anybody but when it comes to the founding block the foundation of any solid society it doesnt matter what relationships exist it doesnt matter who loves or is friends with whom as a christian i think i can love most everybody there are a few it is kind of tough but most everybody i have got some democrats over here i love them they are just wonderful people they are wrong on issues but i love them they are great folks there is no animus but when it comes to the foundation of this nation the home a mother and a father regardless of what other relationships may exist between siblings between anybody else what matters is you dont destroy the central building block i was intrigued when the iowa supreme court back in 2009 didnt use these words but basically said there is no evidence in nature to indicate a preference of a marriage being between a man and a woman it was clear the people of iowa spokei love those folks they were awesome they came out and for the first time since the upordown retention vote started i understand in 1960 or 1962 or so they threw out the judges that were up for reelection because the vast majority in iowa knew that is ridiculous nature makes very clear that you start a family whether you keep both a mother and father things happen there are so many of our greatest americans have arisen from orphanages or from singleparent homes but still it doesnt get away from the optimum being nature says you are best off if you have a mother and father they can produce children yes you can adopt children sure but that is where nature comes in and says yeah but the optimum is a mother and a father in a home i know there are some who are involved in samesex marriage they are not able to love as i do they hate anybody that disagrees with them there are some that can love me though we disagree i hope that the continued hatred that has been growing among some in the samesex community can be tamped down but this is an issue that is foundational to any society that is going to maintain strength going to maintain viability for a long time into the future rather than show we just crossed another milestone on our way to the dustbin of history this is something that is important to our society to our foundation lets love everybody lets use law enforcement to stop those like the evil perpetrator in charleston like the leftwinger i think it was in north carolina that killed the muslims there is no call for that the man needs to go to prison in texas we would say it is a multiple murder i would say you need to get the death penalty for killing more than one muslim there is no place for that but again when it comes to the optimum home a loving mother and father can procreate adopt but regardless of who agrees or disagrees this is going to be a civilization changer and it is not going to be for the better we are going to continue our divisiveness and destructiveness when the highest court in the land has justices that say my opinion is so much more important than the bible moses jesus my opinion is so much more valuable that i am going to violate the law i am going to break the law so i can sit on this opinion so the country can have my forced opinion on it i know there are christian leaders some are ready to capitulate but there are some that wont but we are now to the point steve king and i and some others addressed back when the hate crime bill was being discussed that we are going to lead to the point where you ultimately persecute eventually prosecute people because of their beliefs about sexuality people then were wrong because they couldnt see the future but this is where we have come now if you hold the same beliefs that david axelrod says the president didnt but he said it in order to get elected that a marriage is a man and a woman you hold that belief that most americans have held and still hold that the founders all held regardless of their sexuality they believed a family marriage at least was a man and a woman that that was foundational so i am not sure what is going to happen in this country i dont have that kind of crystal ball but i know if we have two or three justices who are clearly disqualified who have clearly indicatednot only raised questions as to whether they could be reasonably questioned as to their impartiality they made clear they are very very partial i dont know what happens but it isnt going to be good at all justice sotomayor has made statements that indicate she has an opinion before this case was decided so i hope scholars will look carefully at this and they will understand if supreme court justices violate the law in order to change the law dramatically as they want to do is that a valid law i dont believe it is if they break the law in order to make the law it is a void law they need to recuse themselves and let an impartial group on the court make the decision it should be left to the states anyway it is probably sufficient grounds for impeachment for a supreme court justice to violate the law so that they can force their will upon the american people to push through their legislative agenda even though they are not legislators probably impeachment would be in order if they break the law in order to change dramatically the law they shouldnt be on the supreme court it is my hope and prayer they will do the legal thing recuse themselves before the court makes its final decision with regard to marriage if they dont they will go down in legitimate american history books as being exceedingly destructive and history will note that they violated the law in order to change the law so that it would be the way they wanted not with a constitutional amendment not through a legislative process not by a constitutional convention that article v provides for they just had the feeling that they wanted to tinker with over 200 years of law and foundational societal structure and force america to abide by their legislative agenda again i just cant get over that if they dont disqualify themselves they will violate the law to try to change the law with the agenda they have made clear that they have so i hope americans will join me in not only hoping but praying that their hearts will be touched that they will decide not to act illegally that they will be moved toward acting lawfully disqualify themselves and let us get a proper opinion from the supreme court i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0011178851127624512, 0.5011178851127625, 1, "i will stay where we are until the gentleman rules i ask for a recorded

work in moving the coast guard bill forward transportation is one of the most bipartisan bills in this congress i am just so proud that we are really moving this congress forward and putting the american people back to work the coast guard personnel serve this country and do a wonderful job and i truly appreciate the hard work and dedication of these fine servicemembers the coast guard has been protecting our shores for more than 200 years and has done an outstanding job the coast guard was the first agency to react to the terrorist attacks on september 11 and provide critical assistance during the devastation of hurricane katrina this bill provides the resources and policy provisions that the coast guard needs to continue their critical mission assisting migrants and stopping drug shipments at sea searchandrescue missions monitoring our ports and protecting our homeland are just a few of the vital services that the coast guard provides all of which is critical to my home state of florida where 14 deepwater ports and 1 200 miles of coastline are the gateway to america 1530 this legislation also includes important provisions i have long championed that bring maritime laws into the modern era and recognize the positive changes that have taken place in employment rights again i want to thank the men and women serving the coast guard for their hard work and their vigilance in protecting our country this is a good bill and it will allow the coast guard to continue protecting our nation i strongly encourage its passing in both the house and the senate and for the president to sign it into law"], [0.001620858907699585, 0.4983791410923004, 1, "i rise in strong support of the nasa authorization bill before the house this legislation is important because it reaffirms congress commitment to space exploration and the important role nasa plays in the areas of science aeronautics exploration and human spaceflight over the next few months nasa spacecraft will visit pluto and the dwarf planet ceres for the first time we will further develop our nations commercial launch capability even as nasa continues work on the orion space capsule and a new heavylift rocket nasa will also build on its efforts in the important areas of space science and education the bill before the house supports all of these endeavors i want to mention one nasa program in particular the student spaceflight experiments program this program gives students across the country the chance to design microgravity experiments to fly in earth orbit indeed one of these experiments is scheduled to come home from the international space station today the experiment was designed by a team of four students from wilkinson middle school in madison heights michigan the experiment involves the effects of microgravity on water purification in michigan we tend to take the availability of fresh water for granted since we are surrounded by the great lakes but water is a rare and precious commodity in space and hopefully this experiment will help future astronauts to reuse water i want to commend the students who have worked so hard on this microgravity experiment regina alsabagh farah sabah maryam kafra and israa alfadhli their achievement is all the more remarkable since their experiment originally was supposed to be carried into orbit last october but that rocket exploded shortly after liftoff destroying the students experiment fortunately nasa was able to find space on a rocket to the space station that launched in january and the wilkinson students managed to build a second version of their experiment in time for that flight i congratulate the wilkinson students for their hard work perseverance and determination to overcome obstacles its important that congress continue to support nasa and efforts like the student spaceflight experiments program i urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for the nasa authorization bill"],

the point that the gentleman made my point is that for 53 years this product has been the result of bipartisan effort and never before i dont believe have we had a party decision to oppose the ndaa in

not some little something that the members have just gotten in here these are important issues traumatic brain injury russia syria human rights maritime job training they are significant contributions but my point is not necessarily a moral one it is a practical one you work to get these amendments included in the bill but then if you vote against the bill and it goes down in defeat what have you accomplished nothing so i hope that members on both sides who have made contributions and who do support a strong military will rethink the position that they are being asked to take with this bill
