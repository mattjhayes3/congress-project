gentleman from florida indicated this bill is very simple it does nothing more than to confer upon a state the right to go to federal court to stop someone from outside the state from violating its liquor laws it is nothing more it is nothing less it in no way changes substantive law at the state or federal level the bill is necessary not only to prevent illegal shipments to minors but to enable states to police licensing standards track sales and collect taxes on those sales last year illegal alcohol shipments cost states some 600 million in lost revenues state taxes on alcohol are an important source of support for state programs and protecting that funding stream is a legitimate state objective some who are opposed to this legislation argue that it would impede the development of electronic commerce by taxing the internet or chilling direct sales of wine and spirits over the internet well whatever the merits of chilled wine are there is no merit whatsoever to these arguments as my friend the gentleman from florida pointed out lawful sales of alcohol over the internet are thriving such online enterprises as wineshopper com sendwine com and virtualvineyard com generated hundreds of millions of dollars in lawful online sales last year alone just last month geerlings wade of massachusetts which has endorsed this bill and is the nations largest direct marketer of wines announced another new website called winebins com which will sell thousands of labels in the 27 states in which the company is operating is licensed to operate no doubt it will continue to add new labels let us be clear the bill would impose no new taxes on any of these electronic transactions nor would it make them illegal the state laws we seek to defend were put into place to regulate alcohol sales after the failure of prohibition in effect they were the instrument by which an illegal enterprise bootlegging was turned into a lawful and regulated activity some will argue that now these laws are an anachronism well maybe they are correct maybe there is a better way for states to protect minors track sales ensure quality control and to raise taxes but that is an argument better addressed by state legislatures which have the power to rewrite those laws until they do so they have a right to expect that the laws on the books will be enforced that is really what the legislation is all about if we permit states to pass laws but deny them a remedy when those laws are broken we encourage disrespect for the law it is really that simple that is why attorneys general from across

thank the chairman for yielding me time i obviously strongly support h r 5 legislation that would repeal the earnings penalty for hardworking seniors age 65 and over many seniors are shocked to learn that if they work past the age of 65 they may lose some or even all of their social security benefits this is due to something called the social security earnings limit or earnings penalty this rule has been in place since social security started in the 1930s but that does not make it right because of this rule many older people left the workforce making their jobs available for younger workers that policy may have made sense during the great depression when those jobs were needed however that clearly does not apply today todays economy needs the experience and ability of seniors yet the earnings penalty has lived on seniors affected by this penalty lose an average of 8 000 in benefits per year nationwide about 800 000 lost benefits just last year and thousands more avoided losing benefits by cutting back on how much they worked in order to avoid this unfair penalty some might recall that in 1996 we eased the earnings limit for seniors who reached the full retirement age as a result seniors aged 65 through 69 have been able to earn a bit more each year since then without experiencing the cut in their benefits while that was a positive step many of us have long felt that it was wrong to punish hardworking seniors period many of whom just want to work and many of whom have to work what message does the earnings penalty send that the contributions of seniors are no longer needed that seniors should head for the sidelines of the economy due to age alone that seniors do not deserve the benefits that they paid for simply because they continue working i do not think
