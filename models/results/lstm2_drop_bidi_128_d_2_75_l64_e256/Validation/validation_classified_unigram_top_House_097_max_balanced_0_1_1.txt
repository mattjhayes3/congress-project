which calls for a freeze at equal and substantially reduced levels that language correctly reflects the problem of soviet advantages in nuclear weapons particularly in the threat to western europe for example the soviet union has 300 ss20 rockets each with 3 independently targetable warheads and with backups aimed at our western european nato allies nato has none it was only after our nato allies agreed to start deploying the pershing ii missiles at some point in the future that the soviet union began pushing the idea of i nuclear freeze it is easy to understand why the soviets want to freeze the status quo in europe the north atlantic council ministerial meeting on may 45 1981 provi ad an occasion for nato to respond to the soviet initiatives as expected the allies found the soviet proposal for a moratorium on lrtnp deployments wholly unacceptable because it would freeze the west into inferiority by blocking the nato modernization program altogether the allies confirmed their commitments to the december 1979 decision noting that soviet deployments of ss20 missiles already exceeded the total lrtnf deployment planned by nato on the other hand the freeze as proposed by the foreign affairs committee on the production testing and deployment of nuclear arms would not promote stability or reduce the risk of war a freeze at current levels would leave the united states in a position of military disadvantage and would prevent us from taking steps to correct that imbalance i daresay that few of my colleagues who have seen the secret defense intelligence agency briefing on the unitedstatess r visavis the united states with regard to nuclear and nonnuclear positions would disagree with my statement the particular committee freeze resolution would give the soviets little reason to negotiate actual reductions in their nuclear forces furthermore certain elements of the proposal for the freeze would be virtually impossible to verify leaving us unable to confirm soviet compliance with such a freeze recent reports also indicate that the soviets have gone to great lengths to cover up their continuing efforts to increase their armaments in spite of brezhnevs statements that moscow would freeze the building of ss20 sites while the geneva arms reduction talks are underway there are reports that the soviets have built three more ss20 sites targeted on western europe my own personal experience in discussions with the soviets leaves me skeptical about their sincerity in arms reductions when i visited the soviet union in august 1979 i met with members of the presidium of the supreme soviet i raised the question as to what the soviets were going to do to reciprocate for the united states having canceled under president carter the b1 bomber and development of the neutron bomb having delayed deployment of the trident ii missiles and having canceled an atomicpowered aircraft carrier i got no immediate response to my question but the next soviets who spoke stated that the soviet union does not believe in unilateral disarmament even an arms control advocate like harold brown secretary of defense under president carter questioned the sincerity of soviet intentions on the arms race he said we race fast they race fast we slow down they race fast he recently said a congressional endorsement would carry some major risks its effect is to put pressure on the united states but not on the soviet union it would displace or draw attention away from more specific and effective arms control proposals and from actions needed to stabilize the strategic balance inevitably the idea of a freeze will crowd out the fine print if the soviets do not intend to reciprocate for those american arms restraint initiatives then the united states must neither freeze our military capability at an inferior level nor find ourselves negotiating arms reductions from a position of weakness you also have to wonder about the soviets sincerity on arms control and disarmament when you compare the reactions of our two governments to peace demonstrations as you know some 500 000 people demonstrated in new york in june without incident and without interference from our government in contrast 10 members of the soviets 11member peace movement got thrown in jail for their activities in moscow when australian prime minister fraser was in the united states in may he delivered a speech to the foreign policy association in new york a ugust 5 1982 on the importance of ne western alli ance prime minister fraser strongly praised president reagans initiative in calling for arms reduction talks with the soviets but he also emphasized the west should make a serious effort in strengthening its conventional forces in order to reduce the soviet advantage and to reduce their temptation to exploit that advantage prime minister fraser added it seems to me that it is not unilateral disarmament but such a combination of increased effort in the conventional arms field and serious engagement in nuclear arms control negotiations which offers the best means of reducing the risk of nuclear war prime minister fraser also referred to the example of the 1930s and 1940s when there were those who proclaimed a peace movement but who ignored the fact that no one wants war the argument is only between differing views of how peace can best be preserved and preserved with a respect for human freedom and dignity prime minister fraser quotes walter lippmann who wrote in 1943 a commentary called the vicious circle of pacifism which bears repeating today in the name of peace the nation is made weak and unwilling to defend its vital interests the pacifist statesmen justify their surrender on the ground first that peace is always preferable to war and second that because the nation wants peace so much it is not prepared to wage war finally with its back to the wall the pacifist nation has to fight nevertheless but then it fights against a strategically superior enemy it fights with its own armaments insufficient and with its alliances shattered the generation which most sincerely and elaborately declared that peace is the supreme end of foreign policy got not peace but a most devastating war the problem with this resolution in supporting approval of salt ii is concisely summarized by david sullivan in a recent issue of international security review he writes many former top american leaders now have acknowledged that they were misled by the soviets during the negotiations on the key issues of both strategic arms limitation talkssalt i and salt ii the soviets successfully exploited detente and salt negotiations in order to achieve a destabilizing level of strategic superiority over the united states in particular a counterforce capability this advantage translates into negotiating leverage which coupled with the soviet unions propensity for deception as part of its negotiating strategy and with failure to abide by either the spirit or provisions of the agreements bodes ill for the united states in negotiating sound salt iii and theater nuclear force tnf agreements there are two things that concern me about the antinuclear campaign one if the american public should be convinced that nothing is worth the risk of nuclear war then we would be leaving ourselves open to soviet nuclear blackmail two if fears about nuclear weapons are translated into a refusal to upgrade and protect our own nuclear weapons from soviet attack we leave ourselves that much more vulnerable to a potential soviet strike i urge my colleagues

dialog within the parties and there is dialog between the parties it is important that both types of dialog go forward in a constructive way we can count on the diversity of our two great parties to insure a high level of dialog within our parties we depend on comity in the relationship between the parties based on respect and on fairness we have come to define fairness in traditional ways because in fact rules are written for each congress and it is within the power of those who have the votes to change those rules unless tradition interprets the meaning of the word fairness i have done some investigation of the facts about the ways and means committee ratio because the allegation has been made that when the republicans were in control of the congress they did to the democrats what the democrats are now doing to us the percentage of the majority members in the house for the 97th congress is 55 8 the percentage of majority members on the ways and means committee is 65 7 the difference is 9 9 points there has not been so disproportionate a committee ratio over at least the past 20 congresses or for the past 40 years for 16 of the preceding 20 congresses the majorityminority ratio on the ways and means committee has been 15 to 10 or 3 to 2 that statistic certainly approaches tradition the exceptions are as follows the 89th congress in which the democrats gained 37 seats the majority party percentage was then 67 8 in the house and in the committee the percentage was 6817 democrats and 8 republicans in the following congress when the majority house percentage dropped to 56 9 the committee returned to its 15 to 10 or 3to2 format the other few congresses which were exceptions to the by now wellestablished tradition of the 3to2 ratio on the ways and means committee were the 94th the 95th and the 96th congresses when the majority percentages in the house were respectively 66 9 66 7 and 63 4 the committee majority percentages for those congresses were respectively 67 6 67 6 and 66 7 each reasonably consistent with the percentage in the house as a whole the democrats have contended that the 23to12 committee ratio is consistent with past practice and that we republicans adopted a similarly disproportionate ratio when our party held a majority of the seats in the house during the 83d congress the republicans really were continuing a majorityminority ratio which had become virtually traditional by then the committee ratio was 15 to 10 in each congress from the 77th through the 88th congress the republican 83d congress committee
