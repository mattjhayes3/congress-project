to have them this is a special order and it is an important special order it is important because it deals with the most pressing issue facing states and local governments today that is beginning the issue of unfunded mandates as many of us know today has been designated as national unfunded mandate day a day in which local officials across the country were to begin educating the public of the devastating consequences of unfunded federal mandates i was told by the unitedstates conference of mayors which was the primary sponsor of the national unfunded mandate day that over 1 000 local officials around the nation held events in which they singled out unfunded federal mandates as the biggest problem they face in these communities the message to the congress was clear stop approving legislation that imposes requirements on local governments without containing the resources necessary to carry out that mandate this august i and a number of members of congress have formed the congressional caucus on unfunded mandates in order to bring together members of congress who agree that this body must honestly address this issue since august we have 84 members of the congress who have joined the caucus on unfunded mandates as anybody who knows me can attest i am not a frequent participant in special orders however i feel that this issue is so important to our nation that it deserves the topic of discussion on the house floor in addition i feel that a special order devoted solely to unfunded federal mandates is appropriate activity for national unfunded mandate day i am proud to join with my colleagues and local government across this country to try to educate congress and the american people about unfunded mandates unfunded mandates is what we call in the business feel good legislation that is where we in congress get to feel good and pass the cost on to local governments we have got to put a stop to that there are a group of members of congress who have come together to try to find a bipartisan solution this is a bipartisan issue democrats and republicans have come together to try to come to a consensus about how we deal with the unfunded federal mandate issue and we do have limited time this evening i would like to share with my colleagues some profiles of cities that are being adversely affected by unfunded federal mandates for instance the city of phoenix az could provide substantially lower water and sewer rates to its citizens if they did not have to commit much of their local revenue to unfunded mandates in fresno ca the city estimated the costs of closing a landfill without federal mandates to be 10 to 12 million however because the landfill is included as a supedund site the cost of closing the facility will range from 35 to 60 million you should note that all of the costs will be borne by the citys solid waste rate payers in los angeles unfunded mandates will have a detrimental impact on the citys ability to provide essential swvices mayor richard riordan has told me that he could put many more cops on the streets if the city did not have to comply with so many unfunded federal mandates in philadelphia an environmental protection agency requirement that the city develop an advanced wastewater treatment system to inprove the oxygen levels for fish in the delaware water basin will cost philadelphia upwards of 500 million the mayor of philadelphia ed rendell has told me that he will not comply with this mandate because there is no way that he can justify this expenditure to the citizens of philadelphia merced ca located in my congressional district will incur 1 4 million in unfunded federal mandates in 199394 in order to balance this years budget merced had to cut over 30 staff positions remember merced only has a population of 53 000 people and it is suffering in the worst sort of way because of unfunded federal mandates in modesto ca also in my congressional district the city will spend 5 8 million on nine federal mandates over the next 6 years this money could be used to hire 150 police officers in stockton ca the san joaquin county district attorney was contemplating laying off onequarter of his prosecutors because of unfunded mandates however a temporary extension of the 1cent sales tax surcharge allowed the county to retain its prosecutors nevertheless if a permanent solution is not found the da will be forced to let these prosecutors go thus leaving the citizens of san joaquin county unprotected from crime in california the classic example of an unfunded federal mandate is immigration our immigration policy is solely the province of the federal government congress and the administration determine who may enter this country and to a great extent they determine where these immigrants reside however the state of california and its counties are responsible for the education health and welfare of these people for this year governor wilson has stated that providing social services to these people will cost the state at least 1 4 billion it should be clear to those listening to this debate that unfunded federal mandates are a problem what can we do in congress to mitigate the problems of unfunded federal mandates well we can prevent future unfunded federal mandates from being enacted since last year i have tried to offer floor amendments to any legislation considered by the house that contains unfunded mandates last congress the house considered the voting rights language assistance act of 1992 this legislation mandated that states and local jurisdictions containing large minorty populations print voting materials in the native language of those groups this mandate will no doubt increase the normal costs of running elections when the voting rights language assistance act of 1992 was considered on the house floor i offered an amendment that would have required the federal government to reimburse local governments for the increased costs due to this mandate unfortunately my amendment was defeated by two votes this congress i wanted to offer a similar amendment to the national voter registration act more commonly referred to as motorvoter it was estimated that motorvoter would cost my state of califomia 26 million a year the congressional budget office estimated the cost of compliance for all of the states to be 200 million unfortunately the rules committee did not allow my amendment to be offered and the congress went ahead and pushed another unfunded mandate onto the states last week i along with congressman goodling offered an amendment to the education goals 2000 that clarified that the bill would not become an unfunded mandate on states and school districts i am proud that our amendment was unanimously approved by the full house it is my full intention to continue offering these sorts of amendments to unfunded mandates that make their way to th house floor i would appreciate the assistance of my colleagues in this endeavor besides offering floor amendments i believe that this body needs to consider specific mandate relief legislation to that end i dave introduced h r 140 the federal mandate relief act of 1993 my bill is very simple it merely states that compliance with or implementation of an unfunded federal mandate is voluntary for states and localities until the federal govemiment provides the funding needed to pay for the mandated requirements the bill is not retroactive and would only apply to mandates which take effect on or after the date of enactment by requiring the federal government to put up the money before it can enforce any future mandates my bill accomplishes exactly what local governments are requesting that is why h r 140 has been endorsed by the unitedstates conference of mayors the national association of counties the national league of cites the national association of towns and townships the national conference of state legislatures the council of state governments and the national taxpayers union currently h r 140 enjoys the support of 108 members of congress i hope that my colleagues who are not cosponsors

its companion h r 3626 represents the critical push we need to bring jobs innovative technology and services to oklahoma and the nation well into the next century the growth and implementation of the national superhighway bodes well for the citizens of my state where we expect to gain a healthy share of the 3 6 million newly created highskill highwage jobs a broad selection of consumer telemedicine and educational services for rural areas and the ability to export oklahomamade goods to world markets in the future the national communications competition and inforniation infrastructure act builds upon principles that i have promoted since we began hearings on the bill these essential elements include a commitment to universal service for all americans whether rural or urban development of networks that are open and reliable proper cost allocation between consumers and competitors and effective fcc enforcement the importance of giving all americans access to the information highway and the host of educational health economic and quality of life benefits it will provide cannot be understated as a nation and a govern ment we must not bestow the benefits of the information highways on some and deny others just because they live in out of the way places or in poor urban neighborhoods our work on this issue must be done with great care and compassion for real social disruption could result if we do our job poorly in listening to the debate over how to provide and upgrade universal service in a rapidly changing telecommunications environment i developed three core principles for evaluating the proposals before us first to echo title i of the 1934 communications act all the people of the united states must get service at a reasonable charge second the quality of the service must be available to all on equal basis regardless of geographic location or economic station and third the service must be providedin a prompt fashion to all citizensno area of the country should be left off the information highway for any length of time the bill before us today is a good startingpoint for addressing the principles i have raised on several key issues however such as the definition and the funding of universal service the bill gives basic authority for these decisions to a federalstate joint board i have some concerns about delegating such broad authority for such essential issues to this board and i will belooking forward to overseeing the progress in these areas along these lines i am pleased to note that the bill contains specific provisions to ensure rural areas are not left behind as the private sector moves forward to deploy new technology toconsumers as drafted the exemptions allow the commission to apply initially equal access and interconnection irequirements specifically to rural providers only when they would not be unduly burdensome and economically unfeasible we recognize in this legislation something that rural telephone and cable corisumers in oklahoma have known for a long time that new entrants to a marketoften face tremendous obstacles if they must compete against an entrenched service provider the goal of this rural package is to icourage competition in these markets so that residents get new services quickly and at lower prices it is important to reniember that the future cost of our national infrastructure should not be borne by rate payers who remain captive to regulated industries people who want only a chevy should not have to pay the cost of a cadillac certainly consumers with new demands for upscale integrated services expect to bear the proper and equitable cost of such services if they select them moreover providers that use the telecommunications network to reach their consumers should pay for all the direct costs such services incur as well as reasonable share of the joint and common costs of the network the bottom line is this as technology advances we are clearly going to encounter a declining cost industry and the appropriate savings from these efficiencies should be reflected in a consumers phone bill we ensure this goal by providing specific language in the legislation prohibiting cross subsidization between a common carriers telephone exchange service and a common carriers other nonregulated activities and investments cross subsidization occurs when a telephone company uses revenues derived from captive ratepayers to subsidize the companys nonregulated business ventures the effect of this practice is twofold the cost of service to ratepayers increases and the telephone companys nonregulated business ventures receive a comparative competitive advantage over their rivals in those businesses however it is difficult for regulators to properly enforce these crosssubsidy prohibitions without making sure a rigorous cost allocation scheme is in place unless and until the costs incurred by the telephone company are properly allocated between the regulated entity and the nonregulated entity any cross subsidization regulation cannot be effectively enforced my amendment offered and adopted in full committee puts real teeth into the original crosssubsidy prohibition by including cost allocation language that empowers the fcc to audit telephone exchange providers to make sure that consumers are fairly charged for the services they receive enforcement of any regulatory structure rests on the ability of the agency in charge to get the job done that is why i also offered and the full committee adopted an amendment to ensure that the fcc can use its authority given under the 1993 budget act to collect fees from the industry it regulates and target them to augment the fccs sorely understaffed auditing rulemaking and legislative review functions the estimated cost for the fccs implementation of h r 3636 ii 44 million in 1995 and up to 30 million each year thereafter this amendment will enable the commission to get a head start on defraying its administrative costs upon enactment so that taxpayers arent solely responsible for bearing these expenses finally we must remember that a locked door without a key carinot be opened and the opportunities inside cannot be enjoyed universal service proper cost allocation and effective enforcement are the keys to the information highway for all americans i look forward to reaching thqse

be supporting and one which i have not supported in the past i would think you have to ask the question why hasnt this issue been passed and why isnt it behind us well because at that point my friends the issue was not right there was an ongoing investigation by the unitedstates attorney for the district of columbia and when these resolution came up in the past we were advised not by a democrat not to move ahead but at that point it was a republican appointee who said do not move ahead this could hamper my criminal investigation of this matter so we heeded the advice of that unitedstates attorney and the one who came after him but however things have changed to the point where he did send a letter which i read today indicating that for purposes of my investigation an indictment has been issued and now it is my belief that these records can be released and that is what we are doing today so to go back over the last couple of years and continue to harp about something that did not occur that is the reason why it did not occur in 1992 we had 2 votes on release of the transcripts my colleague the gentleman from washington mr svqfrl is correct the minority counsel on that committee told the witnesses what i was there for that their testimony would be held confidential and so we had a vote on july 22nd of 1992 to willy nilly release all the testimony from the witnesses and representative swrft from washington opposed that as i did indicating wait a minute folks that wasnt the deal that wasnt what we told these people we told them that what they told us would be confidential well what did they tell us everything they snipped on the guy next door who came in late about this guy using a vehicle and all sorts of stuff then they went above and beyond that things that had very little to do with the post office operation itself so we defeated those two attempts to just willy nilly release the testimony of those employs who were told that what they told us would be confidential i support the resolution today because it has one very important section it indicates here on the last paragraph that the majority leader and the minority leader shall each appoint a member who will sift through all those documents and mr majority leader do not appoint me because i do not want to sift through those documentsbut someone is going to have to go through that and excise those little offthecuff comments which could be injurious to the fellow employee but which does not have a whit to do about the postal investigation i think that is important that is an

received a letter from a man in michigan fourteen years ago he was diagnosed with hodgklns disease which is a form of cancer but he fought it and thanks to a strong will and some good doctors he was pronounced cured cured by everyone but his employers insurance company who refused to cover him because he was a bad risk and because of it after 15 years on the job his boss was forced to lay him off and now he has no job and he his wife and his two children have no health insurance here you have a guy who did everything right who paid his insurance premiums on time who played by the rules and in return he saw his whole idea of security shattered right before his eyes people dont deserve to be treated like that in americatonight the president presents his plan for health care reform to the nation a plan that will provide health security a plan that will ensure that no american family will ever lose their health insurance a plan that will make sure no other family will be forced to go

respond one of the reasons i came down i have heard this and i must say you are the mistress of the information that has been given to you and present it very effectively one of the reasons i did want to come down because of the small business discussion is that virtually nothing of what you have been told is accurate as far as hawaii is concerned and it is important to us for those of us who do live there to at least get the information on the record"], [0.001140594482421875, 0.5011405944824219, 1, "i thank my colleague for his comments and particularly his concerns about the future pattern that this nafta sets in addition to that his concern about the cost of this nafta this nafta costs between s20 billion and 50 billion to the american taxpayer we are losing the tax revenues just in the first year anywhere between 2 5 and 3 million which will have to be made up and of course in this nafta that we will be voting on tomorrow we will be voting also on a billiondollar tax increase to pay for it that is a small fraction of the overall cost this nafta will be to the american public about 5 percent quite frankly if you use the higher figure that i just mentioned the question we have to face is where will we come up with those dollars as the gentleman has indicated and many others have indicated the supporters of nafta of this nafta are the same people who will be coming to the floor and argue passionately that we cut another billion dollars out of the budget it seems to me that there is an inherent contradiction in both of those positions we have to move forward obviously to get control over our deficit but we have to do it responsibly we have to do it without putting the jobs of the working men and women of our country on the line this nafta will send our jobs south more importantly though for many americans it will lower our wage level in this country as the corporations will use the hedge on the mexican lowwage base as a hedge and bargaining chip against our workers wages it will ask us to do all of that by increasing the american taxpayers taxes i think it is an unconscionable position the gentleman mentioned what we have here in this bill in terms of the research center in texas for 10 million of course we have this new development bank that the gentleman from wisconsin is so vigorously opposed to because we cannot even deal financially with the other international banks that we have which will cost us millions of dollars we have a 17 million tax forgiveness for honda corp in this bill i could go on and on and on let alone all the other deals that have been cut and probably are begin cut at this moment in time with respect to agricultural products and other things it is not a good deal for the american taxpayers it is certainly not a good deal for the american worker or for the mexican worker who is striving to live in a free and democratic society but who has a long way to go i yield further to the gentleman from wisconsin"],
