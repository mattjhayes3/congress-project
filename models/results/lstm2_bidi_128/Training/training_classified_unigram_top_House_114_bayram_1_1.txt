but teachers cops and nurses wont i want to continue today and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente y el comisionado residente no puede ver esta crisis como una herramienta en sus campanias para un puesto mis alto el congreso s6lo ayudari a puerto rico siempre y cuando haya un llamado constante y persistente de los puertorriquehos exigiendo que el congreso cumpla y los puertorriquehlos tienen que indicar lo que esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el pueblo debe decirle a wall street que puerto rico no es una tienda para ser pirateada y que el pueblo de puerto rico no esperari a morir de hambre mientras wall street cuenta sus ganancias si wall street esti comprando bonos con descuentos deben ser pagados con descuentos pero sobre todo tenemos que trabajar juntos por el bien de puerto rico y no podemos dejar que las divisiones politicas sobre la estadidad nos dividan me comprometo como siempre lo he hecho a poner a un lado mis propios sentimientos sobre el estatus de puerto rico y a trabajar con otros puertorriquefios en el congreso y otros lideres en los dos partidos que est6n dispuestos a ayudarnos pero primero tenemos que unirnos empezar a ayudarnos a nosotros mismos y tener un plan claro"], [0.0032129287719726562, 0.9967870712280273, 1, "on april 24 we will mark the 100th anniversary of the armenian genocide 100 years ago 1 5 million armenians along with the syrians and greeks were slaughtered by the ottoman empire in the first genocide of the 20th century the sheer scale of genocide thwarts our capacity to comprehend it 1 5 million armenians killed 6 million jews killed in the holocaust 1 million tutsis the numbers become abstractions sanitized by their enormity it is only when we consider each of those lives individually that the full horror comes into focus the victims of genocide are more than victimsthey are human beings the armenians massacred from 1915 to 1923 were men women and children who were targeted in what was then an unprecedented campaign to wipe out an entire people it is our duty in the modern day to remember those lost and to bear witness that the campaign to destroy the armenian people failed we do so by speaking the truth and we do so by speaking the names of those 1 5 million and by keeping both the way they lived and the way they died alive in our memory earlier this month i asked my thousands of armenian constituents and millions of armenians around the country and the world to submit the names and stories of their family members who were killed 100 years ago the response was overwhelming thousands of people sent the names and stories of ancestors killed in the genocidethe names of infants and toddlers ripped from their mothers arms the names of children and the elderly dying of exhaustion and starvation on a forced march to deir ezzor the names of women and girls raped and brutalized and killed the names of clergy tortured and burned alive in their own churches the names of men robbed of their possessions of their homes and of their lives each victim has a name and a story from glendale to yerevan to jordan and every corner of the world where armenian diaspora lives families sent me those names and those stories it is my honor to read some of those names this hour knowing that it would take more than 1 000 hours more than 50 days to read all of them turkey may deny the genocide our administration may lack the courage to recognize the genocide our congress may lack the courage to recognize the genocide but no one can deny the humanity of its victims and no one can deny our right to speak the truth one hundred years ago 1 5 million armenians were killed in the armenian genocide these are their names george tutunjian

his clevelandbased majorityblack district reluctant to enter the political arena stokes was persuaded to run for office by his prominent brother and by community members he had served for decades as a civil rights lawyer his accomplishments were substantive and of historic proportions the first black to represent ohio stokes chaired several congressional committees including the permanent select intelligence committee and was the first african american to win a seat on the powerful house appropriations committee he used his success to try to increase opportunities for millions of african americans saying im going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system but im going to work within it to go outside the system would be to deny myselfto deny my own existence ive beaten the system ive proved it can be doneso have a lot of others stokes continued but the problem is that a black man has to be extra special to win in this system why should you have to be a super black to get someplace thats whats wrong in the society the ordinary black man doesnt have the same chance as the ordinary white man does louis stokes was born on february 23 1925 in cleveland ohio to charles and louise cinthy stone stokes his father worked in a laundromat and died when louis was young stokes and his younger brother carl were raised by their widowed mother whose salary as a domestic was supplemented by welfare payments louis stokes supplemented the family income by shining shoes around the cleveland projects and clerking at an army navy store he attended clevelands public schools and served as a personnel specialist in the unitedstates army from 1943 to 1946 he returned home with an honorable discharge taking jobs in the veterans administration and treasury department offices in cleveland while attending college at night with the help of the gi bill he attended the cleveland college of western reserve university from 1946 to 1948 stokes eventually earned a j d from the cleveland marshall school of law in 1953 and with his brother opened the law firm stokes and stokes on august 21 1960 louis stokes married jeanette jay francis and they raised four children shelly louis c angela and lorene he devoted himself to his law practice where he became involved in a number of civil rightsrelated casesoften working pro bono on behalf of poor clients and activists he was an active participant in civic affairs working on behalf of the cleveland naacp stokes helped challenge the ohio legislatures redistricting in 1965 that followed the supreme courts one man one vote decision the state legislature had fragmented the congressional districts that overlay cleveland diluting black voting strength stokes joined forces with charles lucas a black republican to challenge that action they lost their case in unitedstates district court but based on stokess written appeal the unitedstates supreme court agreed with the brief in 1967 from that decision followed the creation of ohios first majorityblack district later that year in december 1967 stokes made an oral argument before the unitedstates supreme court in terry v ohio a precedentsetting case that defined the legality of police search and seizure procedures at his brother carls behest louis stokes made his first run for elective office in 1968 he sought to win the seat in the newly created congressional district that encompassed much of the east side of cleveland stokes was hardly a typical newcomer to the political campaign first his brother mayor stokes put the services of his political network at louiss disposal stokes won by a landslide he won his subsequent 14 general elections by lopsided margins in the heavily democratic district taking as much as 88 percent of the vote as a freshman representative stokes received assignments on the education and labor committee and the internal security committee formerly the house unamerican activities committee he enthusiastically accepted the former assignment believing education and labor would be a prime platform from which he could push the agenda for his urban district job training economic opportunity and educational interests but stokes was less pleased with the internal security panel which had lapsed into an increasingly irrelevant entity since its heyday investigating communists in the 1940s and 1950s house leaders disbanded it entirely in the mid1970s during his second term in the house stokes earned a seat on the appropriations committee during more than two decades on the committee stokes steered hundreds of millions of federal dollars into projects in his home state he eventually became an appropriations subcommittee chair or cardinal for veterans hud and independent agencies stokes was the second africanamerican cardinal ever the first julian dixon of california chaired the dc subcommittee years later stokes said of the appropriations committee its the only committee to be on all the rest is window dressing in addition to chairing an appropriations subcommittee stokes is one of fewer than two dozen african americans ever to chair a house committee and one of just a handful to wield the gavel on multiple panels the permanent select committee on intelligence 100th congress the committee on standards of official conduct 97th98th congresses 102nd congress and the select committee on assassinations 95th congress the growing ranks of black members sought to create a power base realizingin the words of representative william bill clay sr of missouri they had to parlay massive voting potential into concrete economic results as freshman house members stokes and clay quickly developed an enduring friendship and became strong supporters of the formation of the congressional black caucus cbc to promote economic educational and social issues that were important to african americans this strategy dovetailed with stokess perception of his role as an advocate for the black community in his district stokes served as chairman of the cbc for two consecutive terms beginning in 1972 after chairman charles diggs jr of michigan resigned from the post a centrist stokes was widely credited with shepherding the group away from the polarizing politics of various black factions toward a more stable and organized policy agenda using his position as cbc chairman and his increasing influence on the appropriations committee representative stokes pushed a legislative agenda that mirrored the needs of his majorityblack district he earned a reputation as a congenial but determined activist for minority issues consistently scoring as one of the most liberal members of the house in the americans for democratic action and the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations vote tallies he advocated more funding for education particularly for minority colleges affirmative action programs to employ more blacks housing and urban development projects and initiatives to improve access to health care for workingclass americans in the 1980s stokes vocalized black concerns that the ronald w reagan administration was intent on rolling back minority gains made in the 1960s and 1970s he described conservative efforts to scale back school desegregation efforts and affirmative action programsas well as massive spending on military programsas a full scale attack on the priorities of the black community he also was an early advocate of federal government intervention in the fight against hiv aids from his seat on the permanent select committee on intelligence stokes was a particularly forceful critic of the reagan administrations foreign policy he gained national prominence as a member of the house select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran when he grilled lieutenant colonel oliver north in 1987 about his role in funding anticommunist nicaraguan contras through weapons sales to tehran at one juncture he reminded north i wore as proudly as you do even when our government required black and white soldiers in the same army to live sleep eat and travel separate and apart while fighting and dying for our country house leaders repeatedly sought to capitalize on stokess image as a stable trustworthy and competent adjudicatorturning to him to lead highprofile committees and handle controversial national issues as well as the occasional ethics scandals in the house when representative henry gonzalez of texas resigned as chairman of the select committee on assassinations speaker thomas p tip oneill of massachusetts tapped stokes to lead the panel which was investigating the circumstances surrounding the deaths of president john f kennedy and dr martin luther king jr in 1978 stokess committee filed 27 volumes of hearings and a final report that recommended administrative and legislative reforms while the panel found that the king and the kennedy murders may have involved multiple assassins james earl ray and lee harvey oswald have traditionally been described as lone killers it concluded there was no evidence to support assertions of a broad conspiracy involving domestic groups or foreign governmentsan assessment that has been upheld for the past three decades the committee did suggest that oswald may have had an accomplice on dealey plaza where kennedy was killed in november stokess chairmanship of the select committee on assassinations led to his appointment by speaker oneill in 1981 as chairman of the house committee on standards of official conduct often called the ethics committee stokes steered the panel through a turbulent period that included investigations of members implicated in the federal bureau of investigations abscam sting and a sex scandal that involved two house members and current and former house pages during the 1990s stokess seniority made him an influential voice on the appropriations committee in 1993 at the start of the 103rd congress he assumed the chairmans gavel of the subcommittee on va hud and independent agencies which controlled one of the largest chunks of discretionary spending in the federal budget stokes prodded federal agencies to hire and serve more minorities republicans praised him for his nonpartisan leadership of the subcommittee but when the gop won control of the house in the 1994 elections and stokes became the ranking member of the panel he often found himself fighting republican efforts to trim federal spending that involved cutting welfare programs including public housing in january 1998 stokes announced his retirement from the house noting that he wanted to leave without ever losing an election moreover a new generation of rising black politicians cleveland was displacing those of stokess generation among his proudest accomplishments as a representative stokes cited his ability to bring appropriations committee money to his district to address needs in housing and urban development and the opportunities that allowed him to set historic precedents as an african american in the house when i started this journey i realized that i was the first black american ever to hold this position in this state stokes told a newspaper reporter i had to write the book i was going to set a standard of excellence that would give any successor something to shoot for after his congressional career louis stokes resumed his work as a lawyer he was a great american heroto be admired and remembered by us all"], [0.004829704761505127, 0.9951702952384949, 1, "let me

representing all of america we have those special people that without our voices would not be able to be heard i simply want to add these words of the pope again to be able to remind everyone why these icons that we are speaking of tonight in the congressional black caucus46 of us along with senator bookerhave a vital role in this place as the pope indicated i would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in the cycle of poverty they too need to be given hope the fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly on many fronts especially in its causes i know that americans today as in the past are working to deal with this problem that is the essence of julian bond who never stopped giving that is the essence of amelia boynton robinson who continued to fight for civil rights up until her death at the age of 104 on august 6 2015 that is the essence of congressman lou stokes a legislative giant the chairman of an appropriations subcommittee a person who went to public housing and places where children were and told america that your children are dying because they are living in substandard housing lead poisoning was killing them which gave me the opportunity as i said before to give a grant to my public housing just this past week on helping with lead poisoning i worked for lou stokes and i am very glad to note that working for him i can say truly a gentleman truly a leader to this congress i beg of you let us look at these icons and celebrate not only their lives but commit to the passion and justice of their lives and as well the words of pope francis that tell us to do unto others as we would like them to do unto us it is my privilege to again thank the members of the congressional black caucus it is with a heavy heart that i rise to speak in praise of louis stokes one of the greatest and most respected members ever to serve in this body who died on tuesday august 18 2015 at his home near cleveland ohio at the age of 90 it is not unusual in these days for commentators and politicians to talk of something called american exceptionalism but what is meant by the term one way to understand the term america is exceptional because it produces and finds persons like louis stokes and affords them the opportunity to utilize their talents to the fullest in the service of their community and their country think about it in what other nation does a little african american boy born in 1925 on the east side of cleveland and raised in the outhwaite homes housing project by a mother who worked as a domestic go on to become a lawyer who argues and wins a landmark criminal justice reform case terry v ohio 392 unitedstates 1 1968 in the united states supreme court become the first african american elected to congress is selected to chair the powerful permanent select committee on intelligence the committee on standards of official conduct the select committee on assassinations and an appropriations subcommittee responsible for more than 90 billion annually in federal outlays yes america is an exceptional nation and louis stokes was an exceptional human being louis stokes was born on february 23 1925 in cleveland ohio to charles and louise cinthy nee stone stokes when he was three years old his father who worked in a laundromat died leaving young louis and his younger brother carl to be raised by their mother who worked as a domestic for affluent families in the wealthy cleveland suburbs louis stokes maternal grandmother played a critical role in his life because she took care of the stokes boys while their mother was at work and instilled in them the idea that work with your hands is the hard way of doing things and encouraged them over and over to learn to use their heads louis stokes took the advice to heart so after attending clevelands central high school and serving in the unitedstates army during world war ii he returned home to attend what is now case western reserve university on the g i bill at night while working during the day for the veterans administration and the department of the treasury after graduating from college in two years where he excelled as a student louis stokes was accepted for admission to cleveland marshall school of law from which he graduated in 1953 three years later his brother carl would also graduate from cleveland marshall school of law and the two of them would go on to form the law firm of stokes stokes specializing in the areas of civil rights and criminal law in 1964 the supreme court decided the landmark case of reynolds v sims 377 unitedstates 533 1964 which established the principle of one person one vote governing the reapportionment of legislative boundaries the following year working on behalf of the local branch of the naacp louis stokes led the legal challenge to the ohio legislatures congressional redistricting which had the effect of diluting african american voting strength in cleveland the challenge was unsuccessful in the federal district court but undeterred louis stokes joined by charles lucas an african american republican successfully appealed the decision to the unitedstates supreme court which in an order handed down in 1967 ruled the redistricting plan unconstitutional and ordered it redrawn resulting in the creation of ohios first majorityblack district the 21st congressional district of ohio ironically louis stokes would defeat his onetime ally charles lucas to win that seat in november 1968 capturing 75 of the vote the closest of his 15 successful elections to the unitedstates house of representatives for the next 30 years from 1969 to 1999 congressman stokes tirelessly fought for his constituents in cleveland and for the best interests of the people of ohio and the united states louis stokes a founding member and chair of the congressional black caucus from 197274 was the epitome of a public servant in his second term in congress he won appointment to the powerful house appropriations committee where he served for 28 years later becoming the second african american cardinal in history when he was selected to chair the va hud and related agencies subcommittee because of the esteem in which he was held by his colleagues and the leadership louis stokes would also later be selected to chair the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the select committee charged with investigating the assassinations of president kennedy and the rev dr martin luther king jr as chairman of the house ethics committee and a person of unquestioned integrity louis stokes oversaw the committees investigation of the corruption scandal known as abscam in 197980 which eventually led to convictions of a senator and six house members louis stokes perhaps is best known for the national attention he attracted in 1987 as a member of the house select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran lrancontra the scandal involving the illegal sale of military weapons to the ayatollah khomeinis iran to generate money to fund the illegal contra war in nicarag ua in response to the claim by colonel oliver north that he acted out of patriotism in engineering the illegal weapons sales and diverting the proceeds to fund the contras a stern louis stokes lectured the misguided colonel north on the rule of law the true meaning of patriotism and in the process american exceptionalism i suppose that what has been most disturbing to me about your testimony is the ugly part in fact it has been more than ugly it has been chilling and in fact frightening im not just talking about your part in this but the entire scenario about government officials who plotted and conspired who set up a straw man a fall guy officials who lied misrepresented and deceived officials who planned to superimpose upon our government a layer outside of our government shrouded in secrecy and only accountable to the conspirators colonel as i sit here this morning looking at you in your uniform i cannot help but remember that i wore the uniform of this country in world war ii in a segregated army i wore it as proudly as you do even though our government required black and white soldiers in the same army to live sleep eat and travel separate and apart while fighting and dying for our country but because of the rule of law todays servicemen in america suffer no such indignity my mother a widow raised two boys she had an eighthgrade education she was a domestic worker who scrubbed floors one son became the first black mayor of a major american city the other sits today as chairman of a house intelligence committee only in america col north only in america and while i admire your love for america i hope that you will never forget that others too love america just as much as you do and that others will die for america just as quick as you will louis stokes never wavered in his belief that america could fulfill the promise of its founders or his dedication to the principles of the declaration of independence and the constitution stating im going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system but im going to work within it to go outside the system would be to deny myselfto deny my own existence ive beaten the system ive proved it can be doneso have a lot of others but the problem is that a black man has to be extra special to win in this system why should you have to be a super black to get someplace thats whats wrong in the society the ordinary black man doesnt have the same chance as the ordinary white man does louis stokes commitment to fairness and equal treatment started long before he was elected to congress as a lawyer for the naacp he brought antidiscrimination lawsuits represented demonstrators arrested in antidiscrimination marches and sitins and took the cases of poor persons charged with crimes one of those criminal cases he took is known to every lawyer in america and appreciated by every person who cherishes the protections guaranteed by the 4th amendment to the unitedstates constitution i am speaking of the famous case of terry v ohio 392 unitedstates 1 1968 won by louis stokes in which the supreme court held that a police officer could stop and frisk an individual only where he could articulate a reasonable basis that the person was or was about to be engaged in criminal activity as a result of terry v ohio a police officer has the right to stop frisk and question an individual he reasonably suspects to be engaged in criminal activity but cannot seize items from that person if the pat down of the suspects outer clothing does not reveal any weapons posing a threat to the officers safety because of louis stokes exceptional advocacy in terry v ohio the right of every individual to secure from unreasonable searches and seizures was preserved while at the same not impeding the ability of law enforcement officers to perform their duties safely every citizen benefits from this ruling and communities that have a history of being harassed by law enforcement protected by the constitution from arbitrary and abusive treatment by law enforcement but the fight for a criminal justice system that respects the rights of all persons is not over that is why i am proud to be the ranking member of the house judiciary subcommittee on crime terrorism homeland security and investigations and a leader in the effort to reform the criminal justice system so that all persons receive fair and equal treatment regardless of their race gender religion or national origin louis stokes fought tirelessly to fulfill the promise of the 14th amendment that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws it is a fight i am proud to continue today louis stokes will be mourned by friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle who had the privilege to serve alongside him he was a mentor to me and i will always remember his commanding presence and cherish the assistance he provided me and the example he set for new members to follow my thoughts and prayers are with his jay louis beloved wife of 55 years to his children shelly louis angela and lorene his grandchildren and the untold thousands of persons who touched and whose lives were touched by one of clevelands greatest sons i ask the house

january 1 and unless congress swiftly reauthorizes tria our economy will be dangerously exposed if we have another terrorist attack in fact one of the financial rating agenciesfitchhas said that if congress doesnt reauthorize tria by the end of january they are going to start downgrading companies and major construction projects which would hurt the american economy the other rating agencies have made equally strong statements about the importance to reauthorize tria already companies are having trouble getting terrorism insurance and many companies that had terrorism insurance have now lost it because there were clauses written into their policies that said if tria is not there they do not have the insurance coverage i also want to thank very much chairman hensarling and chairman neugebauer as well as ranking member waters and the democrats on the financial services committee for their very hard work on this bill which represents a true bipartisan compromise i especially want to thank my colleagues from new york peter king and senator schumer who have worked very hard on this bill which is critical to the state of new york and i would say every state in our union i believe that this compromise will ensure that terrorism insurance remains available and at affordable prices this has always been the purpose of tria and i believe that this bill will accomplish that goal after the last terrorist attack on our homeland9 11insurers realized that they couldnt accurately model for terrorism riskit was simply too unpredictableand the market for terrorism insurance completely shut down without terrorism insurance all construction stopped in new york city we couldnt build anything and thousands and thousands of jobs were lost in response congress came together in a bipartisan way and passed tria which provides a government backstop for terrorism insurance the goal of tria was to make terrorism insurance both available and affordable and that is exactly what it has done this has come at no additional expense whatsoever or cost to the taxpayer initially the house tria bill raised the trigger for the governments backstop by a whopping 500 percent from 100 million to 500 million this would have forced small and mediumsized insurers out of the market entirely and would have actually reduced the amount of terrorism insurance available to american businesses i was strongly opposed to increasing the trigger to 500 million because it would make terrorism insurance unavailable and unaffordable to businesses all across this country fortunately this compromise bill will only raise the trigger for the government backstop from 100 million to 200 million this modest increase will ensure that small and mediumsized insurers are not forced out of the market entirely while also protecting taxpayers and i fully support this compromise approach this bill also slightly increases the amount that the government recoups from the industry after tria is triggered which will ensure that taxpayers are fully repaid for tria if it is needed importantly the compromise does not include the socalled bifurcation proposal which would have treated nuclear biological chemical and radiological attacks differently from other socalled conventional attacks this made no sense whatsoever and this compromise sensibly drops this proposal entirely a terrorist attack is a terrorist attack finally i am pleased that the bill reauthorizes tria for a full 6 years this will provide much needed certainty to businesses across the country as they expand and create more american jobs support for reauthorization of tria is deep and it is strong in the business community across this country i enter into the record a letter from 28 different business stakeholders strongly supporting the reauthorization and the need for tria dear representative american businesses strongly support h r 26 the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 this bill is the same as the tria legislation that passed the house by a bipartisan vote of 417 7 on december 10 2014 our coalition represents a diverse and broad majority of business stakeholders we urge you to support the bill when it is considered under suspension of the rules this week the terrorism risk insurance act is vital to the millions of businesses job creators and workers across the country reliant on tria to secure terrorism insurance and protect our economic growth following the attacks of september 11 2001 congress created tria to address a void in the marketplace foster economic stability and provide certainty to forprofit and nonprofit entities across the country for the past dozen years the united states has relied on tria as a fiscally responsible terrorism risk management plan to protect taxpayers and our national security and stability it is critical that congress act immediately to keep our terrorism insurance protection program in place we urge your support of this

have a strategy that deals with boko haram this report can be critical in our efforts to empower and complement the efforts of the multinational joint task force as well as the commitment espoused at the recent lake chad basin regional security summit so i would say that we have to recognize that we now have an individual this young woman can give us the intelligence i am concerned that these

i was in nigeria i think it is an excellent command among all the other commands they can be dynamic in their work my resolution my amendment my sense of congress is to give us focus to bring back the

school girl named ameina nkeki was found tuesday by the civilian jtf vigilante group which fights alongside the nigerian military in a village near the sambisa forest nkeki had a baby with her and told the militia members she had escaped from boko haram captivity indeed just last night right before presenting before the rules committee on this amendment i met with a remarkable couple whose name i do not want to mention in order not to place their lives in danger this couple through their ngo helped in the rescue recovery and reintegration of over 10 chibok girls because of their remarkable work the girls are now able to continue to pursue their education unfortunately the lives of these good samaritans are now in jeopardy i plan to do everything in my power to make sure that they and the persons they seek to empower are not harmed this is why i have introduced the bipartisan measure h res 528expressing the sense of the house of representatives regarding the victims of the terror protection fund and this is why i am working on a measure related to a special envoy on boko haram to the lake chad basin support for this amendment is timely as it is 1 strongly condemns the ongoing violence and the systematic gross human rights violations against the people of nigeria and the lake chad basin carried out by boko haram 2 expresses support for the people of nigeria and the lake chad basin who wish to live in a peaceful economically prosperous and democratic region 3 calls on the president to support nigerian lake chad basin and international community efforts to ensure accountability for crimes against humanity committed by boko haram against the people of nigeria and the lake chad basin particularly young girls kidnapped from chibok and other internally displaced persons affected by the actions of boko haram additionally the report calls that no later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this act the secretary of defense the secretary of state and the attorney general shall jointly submit to congress a report on efforts to combat boko haram in nigeria and the lake chad basin among others the report shall also include the following elements 1 a description of initiatives undertaken by the department of defense to assist the government of nigeria and countries in the lake chad basin to develop capacities to deploy special forces to combat boko haram 2 a description of united states activities to enhance the capacity of nigeria and the countries in the lake chad basin to investigate and prosecute human rights violations perpetrated

report can be critical in our efforts to empower and complement the efforts of the multinational joint task force mnjtf as well as the commitments espoused at the recent lake chad basin regional security summit mr chair the unitedstates war on terror has been waged for over a decade and the lesson is clear that our adversaries adapt very quickly because they are not constrained by geographic limitations in the beginning it was only al qaedanow the list includes al shabaab boko haram which last year affiliated itself with isis isil indeed the data on persons affected by violent extremism is staggering there are now more than 2 2 million nigerians and over 450 000 internallydisplaced persons idps and refugees in neighboring cameroon chad and niger an estimated 4 2 million people in the lake chad basin region face water and food security crises including 800 000 in nigerias northern borno and yobe states nigeria where an estimated 184 children a day risk starvation without the immediate provision of emergency food assistance boko haram continues to claim responsibility for atrocious and targeted violence ranging from burnings kidnappings and killings of civilians and school children such as the chibok girls and a suicide bombing of the united nations building in abuja on august 26 2011 that killed 21 people and injured dozens more many of them aid workers supporting development projects across nigeria half of persons displaced are children i continue to commend the tireless efforts of the united nations united states officials regional leaders civil society

qaeda and isis in africa and pakistan for this reason our military must adapt as quickly and as seamlessly as our adversaries in empowering our allies our message must be clear the united states must expand its capacity to meet the terrorist threat where it emerges whether here in the homeland or abroad the nuremberg trials were essential in bringing to justice war criminals who committed acts of barbarism against civilians and military personnel during world war ii but a critical component of bringing war criminals to justice is the gathering and preservation of evidence no person whether they travel to a battle field and later return to their native country or live in the region where they commit acts of terrors should rest well because they believe that no one will come to seek justice on behalf of the millions of lives destroyed our message must be clear terrorism will not thrive on our watch i ask for your support of this amendment"], [0.00567251443862915,

montgomery to protest the denial of their voting rights led by our colleague john lewis of the student nonviolent coordinating committee and reverend hosea williams of the southern christian leadership conference these foot soldiers began the march towards the alabama state capitol in montgomery they pledged to keep on walking until they secured the freedoms promised to them by the unitedstates constitution as they crossed the edmund pettus bridge a wall of alabama state troopers were waiting at the foot of the bridge news stations from across the country televised the brutality that followed as foot soldiers like hosea williams john lewis amelia boynton robinson reverend f d reese bob nance of lowndes county albert turner sr of perry county and so many others were attacked on edmund pettus bridge on what has become known as bloody sunday the journey of the foot soldiers we honor today was not an easy one they were discriminated by whites and ostracized by blacks who were afraid to join them but still they persevered because they could no longer bear the burdens of secondclass citizenship the president of the dallas county voters league reverend f d reese wasnt going to let nobody turn him around he told me he said that given the conditions that existed in selma and the south at that time he wanted to make sure that things were different he was willing to do whatever was necessary to ensure that peopleno matter their race color or creedwould have the right to vote he said the lord gave us determination to keep moving forward we were determined to let the lord lead us and direct us so that all people regardless of their color would have access to the political process he went on we were not at all afraid because we were determined that whatever it took even if it meant our lives we were going to move alabama and the states and this nation forward amelia boynton robinson literally felt the blows of injustice as she was beaten on the bridge by alabama state troopers and left for dead amelias will and dignity suffered no damage but it made her more resolved than ever to continue the fight for equal voting rights two days after bloody sunday over 2 500 foot soldiers heeding the call from dr martin luther king came to selma to join the marchers on march 9 1965 led by dr king and reverend ralph abernathy and many clergy from across this nation the foot soldiers once again left from the historic brown chapel ame church and walked to the edmund pettus bridge dr king stopped at the top of the bridge while a sea of state troopers stepped aside on bended knees dr king began to pray as the thousands of marchers joined him as if moved by the spirit dr king turned around and walked back to the church tuesday was not to be the day to complete the 54mile journey the second march attempt was known as turnaround tuesday the fight for voting rights was fought both in the streets and in the courtrooms attorney fred gray helped pave the way for the final selma to montgomery march he was a member of the legal team that represented hosea williams john lewis and amelia boynton robinson in williams v wallace because of his work and the courage of an alabama federal judge federal judge frank johnson ruled that the foot soldiers had a first amendment right to petition the government through peaceful protest and ordered federal agents to provide full protection to the foot soldiers during the selma to montgomery march under court order the unitedstates army the federalized alabama national guard and countless federal agencies and marshals escorted more than 8 000 foot soldiers on march 21 1965 as these brave men and women began their historic 54mile journey from selma to the steps of the alabama state capitol in montgomery alabama the extraordinary bravery and sacrifices these foot soldiers displayed in pursuit of a peaceful march from selma to montgomery brought national attention to the struggle for equal voting rights and served as a catalyst for congress to pass the voting rights act of 1965 which president lyndon johnson signed into law on august 6 1965 as alabamas first black congresswoman i know that the journey that i

overbut we are going to talk about thisa bad deal is worse than no deal i am going to say it again a bad deal is worse than no deal a deal the unitedstates and the rest of the international community can accept should be one in which iran is no longer a nuclear threat at what point did we forget this mr president at what point did we lay down and decide that a nuclear iran if it is 20 years from now is better than what a nuclear iran is now mr president you have got to listen to what you are saying israeli prime minister netanyahu explained to president obama that the joint comprehensive plan of action threatens the survival of the state of israel it threatens the survival of the state of israel i believe that congress should not be party to any agreement that fails to protect the vital interest of israel and other allies in the region that is why i voted no on the iran nuclear agreement review act i am not in disagreement with congress providing oversight of a final comprehensive deal but a horrible deal isnt something congress should even have to consider i have previously stated and will say again that i have always made the security of our strongest ally in the middle east a priority and will not support any deal that allows iran the opportunity to develop a nuclear weapon though a final deal has not been yet announced we know based off the details of the jcpoa announced in april of the potential for a bad deal under the framework announced in april iran will be able to maintain over 6 000 centrifuges they possess of the 6 000 centrifuges 5 000 of those will continue to enrich uranium five thousand what part of not having a nuclear iran are we kidding ourselves here with and then his wonderful snap back provisions i am one of those that said we shouldnt have a snap back they should have never gone away in the process why are we talking about snap back provisions when this body has clearly spoken that the sanctions should stay and if anything they should get tighter but we are now talking about snap back provisions what a world we live in if they dont fulfill their commitment sanctions will magically snap back when i read that it just amazes me that if they dont keep their commitmentswhy do we believe they are going to keep any commitments this is just an amazing thought to me it took several years of unitedstates pressuring for our european allies before they started seriously enforcing the u n security council sanctions currently in place while a unitedstates president can unilaterally reinstitute sanctions that were previously waived the european union has to receive support from all 28 members for reimposition of former sanctions think about that that is something we ought to talk about a similar scenario could be observed at the u n security council a unanimous vote by all 15 unitedstates security council members in the affirmative would be needed for sanctions to be put back in place how many of us in this room tonight and how many of you who may be thinking about this actually believe that will actually happen do you believe that would i dont china and russia both permanent members of the u n security council have the most to gain from having unfettered access to iranian markets it has been widely reported that russia is moving forward with the selling of s300s the antiaircraft weapon to iran such a weapon system makes the potential for israeli or american airstrikes against iranian nukes just that much more difficult to carry out russia whose own economy is hurting as a result of the sanctions is looking to diversify its investments in other economies that show strong potential for growth china is always looking for new sources of energy and with the elimination of international sanctions iran will have the ability to sell more oil on the international market then there is the issue of possible military dimensions to receive an accurate picture of irans nuclear capabilities it is imperative to know how close they got to developing or have gotten to developing a nuclear weapon it is only after we can determine if iran ever developed a nuclear warhead or triggering mechanism that the international community can actually know irans breakout time irans pmds must be made known to the international community priorpriorto any permanent sanction relief being instituted you know this pending bad deal makes the region and the greater national community worse off what i have heard in this chamber tonight is very disturbing what i have heard from leaders in this administration is even more disturbing they have willingly determined in my mind to throw israel under the bus and i believe maybe for a peace prize mr kerry maybe you didnt make a mark in the senate mr kerry maybe you didnt make a mark as secretary of state maybe you are looking for a peace prize your peace prize should be come home now and walk away from a bad deal if you want to be recognized in the world for standing up for what is right then walk away from a bad deal no one wants iran to have a nuclear weapon they are not capable of handling one they are the biggest suppliers to terrorism around the world and yet we are talking about talking to a country that says just recently just in the last 2 days their leader has said it is now time for us to spout hatred at the zionists and we are negotiating with them they dont want to say israel has even a right to exist and we are sitting at the table with them we want to let 5 000 centrifuges keep spinning and keep spinning and keep spinning and keep spinning and we are going to negotiate with them you do not negotiate with unstable people you negotiate with people who want to live in the bonds of a civil society in a civil world and irans leadership is not that person we are fooling ourselves this administration has become just completely tunnelvisioned toward legacy when you have a domestic agenda that has been as terrible as this administration i dont blame you for looking overseas but your domestic agenda is no comparison to the failure of a foreign policy when world leaders ask what is americas role because they dont even know tonight i hope the crescendo of voices in this chamber reaches across the ocean to vienna the last words i would like secretary kerry to hear before he sits down with the iranians are a bad deal is worse than no deal death to america not shouted on the streets here in washington not shouted on the streets in new york city or san francisco or atlanta it was shouted in the parliament of iran just recently when they said we are not going to allow inspections and we are sitting down to negotiate with them death to america and we are sitting down negotiating with them as if they are reasonable people have we lost our focus have we lost our vision of being the shining light to the world for freedom and hope and decided that it is much better off maybe for our political world or maybe our personal achievements to sit down with a government that says israel should not even have the right to exist and if we could we would annihilate them tomorrow we are going to continue funding those who have lobbed bombs on innocent men and women in israel and who will sit down at a negotiating table and say we are not going to allow you to inspect wherever you want we are going to keep what we want to keep and by the way even the administrations own belief is we are going to keep 5 000 spinning centrifuges spinning 5 000 spinning you know what some have said time is irans friend i agree as long as they can keep our secretary of state at that table those centrifuges spin as long as they keep us tied up debating this in this administration the centrifuges spin as long as we keep doing this the centrifuges spin it is time to put sanctions back in place because they are spinning it is time to tighten the screws on iran because those centrifuges are spinning it is time for us not to let up because the centrifuges are spinning and i do not want to see a world in which my children grow up and the people in israel grow up knowing that iran has a bomb when they are ready to take them out in a certain notice

parttime screeners klamath falls has even offered to hire private screeners tsa says no tsa is giving away equipment surplusing equipment that is still perfectly functional for an airport like klamath falls so there is no cost involved there at worst they are going to have a few parttime screeners and they are going to have to move the surplus equipment there and plug it back in this isnt going to

influential under the deal reached this week this will also reinforce the position of its allies a stronger and wealthier iran in the coming phase will be able to stand by its allies and especially the palestinian resistance more than at any other time in history what does that mean i can tell you what it means because in 2006 when i chaired the terrorism subcommittee we were in haifa when nasrallah was firing off the iranianmade rockets with 90 000 ball bearings in the warheads into the town of haifa there were 600 victims inside the trauma hospitals and now iran has transferred over 80 000 missiles what is it nasrallah wants that he doesnt have currently he wants guidance systems so that those missiles will hit targets such as individual buildings in tel aviv the airport jerusalem that is what he needs that is what iran is telling nasrallah it will provide it needs the hard currency and with this agreement will come the hard currency it is also committed to restock the inventory that hamas used when it fired off its rockets into israel from gaza and to rebuild the tunnels all of this is what the iranians seek to fund but to do that they need the sanctions lifted when they lift those sanctions who is going to be the primary beneficiary it is going to be people such as the iranian revolutionary guard corps that will be strengthened look if this agreement goes through iran gets a cash bonanza it gets a boost to its international standing it gets a lighted path toward nuclear weapons with sweeping sanctions relief we have lessened our ability to challenge irans conduct across the board as iran grows stronger we will be weaker to respond the question before us today is whether temporary constraints on irans nuclear program are worth the price of permanent sanctions relief when i say the revolutionary guard is going to be the beneficiary i say that because they are the ones that have taken over so many of the major companies in iran and they

freedom for all to express their religious beliefs or express none at all yet all over the world countries such as pakistan islamic extremist groups such as isis and otherswho have no part in a civilized society and need to be banished and done away with in a civilized societychoose to horrendously kill someone for whom they pray and the faith that they have explain to me how you are supposed to worship a god that says it is okay to behead 16 christians or to blow up their church or desecrate their facilities it is something that must be addressed you see these atrocities should not just startle those of religious faith and of nonreligious faith as well they should startle and shock the world to realize that this is something that must cease for me it is personal as a christian as one of faith my faith is described to me as being one in christ with other believers for me when one is beheaded we are all persecuted including those here in our comfort in america you

enacted in 2008 on a bipartisan basis is due to expire in just a few days on december 19th h r 4246 recognizes that some of those who serve in the military encounter financial difficulties during or in the wake of their service and that they merit relief from the additional proof requirements of the means test in fact servicemembers are often targeted by unscrupulous lenders as reported by the wall street journal earlier this year payday lenders prey on service members and their families at twice the rate that they use to target civilians these shortterm highinterest loans are often used to provide small amounts of money to pay for unexpected or emergency expenditures or to obtain advances on tax refunds yet as a result of excessive interest rates these loans can quickly balloon into overwhelming debt obligations according to the journal some servicemembers have paid as much as 600 percent to 700 percent for the life of their loans or even four times the amount of the original

washington has been micromanaging our classrooms federal rules now dictate how states and local communities measure student achievement fix broken schools spend taxpayer resources and hire and fire their teachers no child left behind was based on good intentions but it was also based on the flawed premise that washington knows what students need to succeed in school and what do we have to show for it less than half of all fourth and eighth graders are proficient in reading and math an achievement gap continues to separate poor and minority students from their more affluent peers in some

the failed status quo and turn over to our nations parents and our state and local leaders the authority flexibility and certainty they need to deliver children an excellent education we reached this moment because replacing no child left behind has long been a leading priority for house republicans for years we have fought to improve k12 education with three basic principles reducing the federal role restoring local control and empowering parents the final bill by the house and senate conference committee reflects these principles the bill reduces the federal role in k12 education by repealing dozens of ineffective programs which place unprecedented restrictions on the secretary of education eliminating onesizefitsall schemes around accountability and school improvement ending the era of highstakes testing and preventing this administration and future administrations from coercing or incentivizing states to adopt common core the bill restores local control by protecting the right of states to opt out of federal education programs and by delivering new funding flexibility so taxpayer resources are better spent on local priorities the conference agreement also returns to states and school districts the responsibility for accountability and school improvement a set of broad parameters will help taxpayers know that their money is being well spent while ensuring state and local leaders have the authority necessary to run their schools the bill also empowers parents by providing moms and dads with the information they need to hold their schools accountable the conference agreement strengthens school choice by reforming programs that affect charter schools and magnet schools and it prevents any federal interference with our nations private schools and home schools reducing the federal role restoring local control empowering parentsthese are the principles we have fought for because these are the principles that will help give every child a shot at a
