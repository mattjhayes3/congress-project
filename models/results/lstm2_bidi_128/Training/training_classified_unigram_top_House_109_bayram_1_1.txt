unacceptable but unfortunately it is standard operating procedure for the republican leadership in congress i am hopeful that a significant number of republicans will join our motion to instruct being true to the letter that they sent opposing cuts and protect medicaid if congress cuts medicaid funding states will be forced to reduce medicaid coverage or benefits jeopardizing needed services for

colorado i want to express my particular thanks to joel hefley the dean of our colorado delegation who i am proud to call my colleague and friend he and i have joined forces on a wide variety of matters including steps to respond to the danger to our states communities from wildfires and i have benefited greatly from the opportunity to work with him both before and especially after i became a member of the armed services committee the senate bill included language to name a housing facility at fort carson in honor of representative hefley who is retiring at the end of the year i thought it was appropriate and while the conference report does not include that provision i am glad to note that it does include a section section 2002 that accurately states that since his election in 1986 representative hefley has served in the house of representatives with distinction class integrity and honor the same section goes on to note that representative hefleys efforts on our committee have benefited the military value of installations in colorado and the quality of life of the men and women stationed there it also reminds us that he was a leader in efforts to retain and expand fort carson and was a leader in efforts to eliminate inadequate housing on military installations beginning with a pilot program at that colorado base an effort which has brought meaningful improvements to living conditions for thousands of members of the armed forces and their spouses and children at installations throughout the united states and it concludes by saying that congress recognizes and commends representative joel hefley for his 20 years of service to benefit the people of colorado members of the armed forces and their families veterans and the united states a welleamed commendation

fulfill its mission haats is the primary site for training military aviators on operations in hostile high altitude and powerlimited environments under all seasonal weather conditions such as afghanistan responding to language i had included in the defense authorization bill last year the army national guard pledged to provide two blackhawks to haats however im told haats needs five blackhawks in order to sustain training requirements to lay the foundation for possible future action to meet that need our committees report included a request for the secretary of the army to provide a report on high altitude aviation training to the congressional defense committees by december 15 2006 the report is to include 1 the current location and type of high altitude training to include the percentage of pilots who receive such training on an annual basis at each location and the types of aircraft used in such training 2 the number and type of helicopters required to provide the high altitude aviation training needed to sustain the war strategies contained in the 2006 quadrennial defense review assuming that priority for such training is given to commanders instructor pilots aviation safety officers and deploying units and 3 a thorough evaluation of the accident rates for deployed army helicopter pilots who received high altitude training and deployed helicopter pilots who did not receive such training including the number of accidents related to power management using high and low estimates and the number of accidents involving combat and noncombat environments i expect that this report will make clear the importance of haats critical mission and the need for its having more aircraft and this conference report includes a section section 2827 requiring a report by november 30th of this year analyzing of any potential expansion of the pinon canyon maneuver site which is associated with fort carson as a member of the armed service committee

at buckley air force base 4 9 million for construction at peterson air force base 21 million for work at schreiver air force base and 26 1 million to be used at fort carson and at the national level

2007 it also expands tricare reserve select to members of the selected reserves and terminates the current threetier eligibility program while putting a oneyear moratorium on any increases in retail

agreements over the years but despite the promises made to sell them to an increasingly skeptical public they have manifestly failed to open foreign markets for unitedstates producers or even to limit predatory foreign commercial practices such as subsidizing dumping and exchange rate manipulation in fact the trade flows clearly shows that the main new accomplishments of these trade agreements have been to help unitedstates and foreignbrand automakers alike supply the american market from lowwage export platforms like mexico as symbolized by the ludicrously unequal auto tariffs left in place by unitedstates negotiators of china trade deals unitedstates policy on automotive trade with china is speeding down the same road and will likely produce the same results the united states still runs a small trade surplus in autos with china but since 2000 chinese auto eiports to the united states have outpaced the united states vehicle exports to china by a fourtoone ratio the unfair chinese

million victims of nazi hatred and aggression during the pogron known to us as the holocaust i am also humbled to stand in this cathedral of freedom and honor the lives of the many heroes who fought so bravely against unimaginable odds to ef eat a genocidal madman more than 60 yearsago adolf hitler and his nazi regime set out to eradiiate european jewry so committed were they to the accomplishment of this goal their socalled final solution that even in the waning days of world war ii when defeat was imminent the germans continued even more urgently rounding up jews all over europe and sending them to their deaths driven by a radical and uncompromising antisemitic ideology the nazis redoubled their efforts to reach every last jew before the war ended they were in a rush time was running out depleting sorelyneeded resources from the war effort german forces swept across europe assembling and annihilating community after community individual after individual from their homes ghettos and hiding places during the last year of the war in europe german defeat was all but accomplished and yet their hatred and bigotry survived and thrived consequently the nazis murdered more than 700 000 jews in that last full year of the war including most of the jews of the last large community in europe hungary there in one of the most efficient deportation and murder operations of the holocaust the nazi and hungarian regimes deported 437 000 jews to auschwitzbirkenau in just eight weeks and killed tens of thousands more later that year six decades have passed since allied troops liberated the labor and death camps and yet the memory of the horrors perpetrated against the jewish people is seared into the collective conscious of the world however sadly we cannot undo history and we cannot reverse the atrocities carried out by a barbarous german regime what remains for us is to honor and preserve the memories and lives of both the victims and the survivors of the

very difficult to understand the magnitude of these storms and what the devastation that they left behind is the school systems in the gulfcoast were hit particularly hard the wind tore off roofs of

their own resources to meet the increased enrollments in spite of the pressures on schools to reopen and enroll displaced students it was not until december nearly 5 months after the levees broke that

a sense of the congress that urges states to expedite the release of these funds to local school districts families are eager to return to their communities but will only do so if they can be assured

better late than never i wish we would have done this earlier we have known for some time the deadline was coming i appreciate the efforts of the chairman of the committee to get the attention of the house to this bill we passed it in committee some time ago before the break it frankly could have come to the floor before that i say that because i am pleased with this bill in general i think it is useful that we are producing it and there are differences between this bill and the one passed by the senate and we do need some time to work them out none of them is of enormous difficulty it seems to me they all have a similar capacity but it would have been better if we had done this earlier having said that i want to stress what is so important about this bill to me and it is it establishes or maintains the principle that we will try to minimize the extent to which terrorists influence decisions that we make here in america i do not regard this as a favor to the insurance companies frankly terrorism insurance would i believe not exist if it were not for this bill or if it did exist it would be at very high premiums the insurance industry would have the option either of walking away from offering this or of charging high premiums i do not think the insurance industry would be greatly disadvantaged the losers if we do not reenact terrorism risk insurance are people who want to build and particularly in those cities that are seen as potential targets of terrorism we have been told by people who want to do large commercial buildings very important to the big cities of this country to the areas that would be the targets of terrorism that they would not be able to get loans that are necessary obviously to build if they are not fully insured lenders are telling us yes we cannot now lend large amounts of money tens hundreds of millions of dollars to a building that might be at risk from terrorism and be uninsured against that risk i think we ought to have a re~ponsible insurance system so that where we can minimize risk we can give people an incentive to be responsible in dealing with them i do not think it is good public policy to say to people who want to build in new york or chicago or los angeles or here in washington d c there are terrorists out there and they want to blow things up and you will bear that financial responsibility that is up to you that is unfair to the cities and it gives the terrorists leverage over our economy so this is a bill which in my mind is not for benefit of the insurers but for the insured and it is for the benefit of the insured so that we can go forward with the development of our economy indeed there is one issue here regarding the world trade center that we have not yet fully resolved and i appreciate the chairman showing some interest in this we were asked both of us by members from the new york area about some provisions to deal with the possibility that the world trade center reconstruction will take too long frankly those in charge in new york did not come to us until very late in the process and it was not possible to accommodate something of that complexity now i hope we do not rule it out for the future but if they had come to us earlier we might have been able to deal with it somewhat differently but that illustrates the point this is a bill to make sure that economic activity in our biggest cities can go on uninterrupted and the alternative is to let the terrorists put a terrorist tax on building larkge buildings in our big cities and we should not allow that let me just say finally i

iran and syria to destabilize lebanon particularly through the bloodthirsty instrument of hezbollah syria will pay a heavy price if it does not cease its relentless campaign of intimidation and
