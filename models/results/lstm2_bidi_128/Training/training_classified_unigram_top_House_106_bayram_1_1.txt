william janklow and the south dakota congressional delegation the history of the sioux nation which includes the dakota lakota and nakota sioux and the state of south dakota is one that is probably best described as a work in progress as my colleagues may know the interactions between the various tribes and nonindians have at too many points been marred by mistrust misunderstanding and mistakes the tribes and the people of the state have attempted to bridge the cultural differences over the years perhaps the most memorable and most successful was an effort spearheaded by the late governor

goal through this session and next congress i am certain the gao study will provide important information about existing programs with that information in hand we can work toward an economic

yield myself such time as i may consume this is a pretty awesome time to be here i am offering today along with the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from washington an amendment that is known as aimees law i would like to take a few moments to discuss why this is important to americans and how come a nationwide grass roots effort has worked towards its passage first of all i would like to reference this chart according to the department of justice the average time actually served by a rapist in this country and released from state prison is 5h years for molesting a child 4 years and for murder 8 years this is outrageous it is unconscionable we have to act today to change this it is not as if these criminals are suddenly boy scouts after their release from prison the recidivism rates for sex offenders are very high i think most people agree once a molester always a molester as the department of justice found in 1997 over the 3year period following the prison release an estimated 52 percent of discharged rapists and 48 percent of other sexual assaulters were rearrested for a new crime here is that statistic many of those go on to commit other sex offenses light sentencea for todays most heinous crimes contribute to an epidemic of completely yes i said it completely preventable crimes consider each year more than 14 000 rapes molestations and murders occur every year by somebody who was let out of prison for committing that exactsame crime in some 1 700 of these cases individual cross state lines and then reoffend again we talk a lot about accountability in this chamber it is time to restore some accountability to states that release these dangerous predators into our neighborhoods aimees law would add an additional factor to the formula for distributing federal crime funds to the states specifically the amendment would provide additional funding to states that convict a murderer rapist child molester if that criminal had previously been convicted of one of those same crimes in a differ~nt state the cost of prosecuting and incarcerating that criminal would be deducted from the federal crime assistance funds intended to go to the first state in other words the state that is irresponsible lets the rapist murderer molester out and then they cross state lines and reoffend again a portion would be taken away from their crime assistance funds and given to the new state enough to cover the costs of incarceration prosecution and apprehension of that monster a safe harbor would not require the funds transfer if the criminal has served 85 percent of his original sentence and if the first state was a truthinsentencing state with a higher than average typical sentence for the crime aimees law a bipartisan effort from day one passed the senate last week with a whopping 81 to 17 vote aimees law is enthusiastically supported by law enforcement and victims rights groups nationwide here is just a smattering of those who are supportive the law enforcement community in particular they understand the need for this legislation they are in the trenches they are fighting this fight every day the nations largest police union the national fraternal order of police representing some 250 000 brave police officers nationwide has strongly backed this amendment and has appeared at all public events to help push for its passage their president has said the bill addresses this issue smartly without infringing on the states and without federalizing crimes among the other law enforcement groups that have endorsed the bill is the california correctional police officers association and some of the others members can see victims rights and child advocacy groups have also endorsed the bill and made this one of the most important issues that they focus on child help unitedstatesa klaas kids foundation kids safe mothers outraged at molester and the list goes on and on and on from around the country americans have signed petitions called our offices and sent emails demanding passage of aimees law even dr laura is urging her 18 million listeners across america and has been doing it all week also including it on her web site for a call to action on this particular piece of legislation this is aimee willard i never met her this legislation is named for her but i have become very close with her through the passage of this legislation and close with her family aimee was senselessly raped and murdered by a man who was let out of prison for serving 12 years for murder for killing somebody over a parking spot if this man had served 85 percent of his sentence aimee willard would still be alive today aimee was an allamerican college athlete who wanted to work with children we are never going to know all that we lost when she was taken from us but we should do what we can to prevent others from enduring the same kind of pain and agony and following her to a needlessly early grave many courageous victims and survivors have made extraordinary efforts to help me pass this bill i cannot mention them all but i wanted to list a few many of them came to washington twice to support the bill and testify before the subcommittee on crime h4416 co there is gail willard who lost her daughter aimee mark klaas who lost his daughter polly mary vincent a rape survivor fred goldman who lost his son ron mika moulton who lost her son christopher trina easterling who lost her daughter lorin jeremy brown a rape survivor louis gonzalez who lost his brother ipollito the greishabers who lost their daughter jenna the pruckmayrs who lost their daughter bettina the schmidts who lost their daughter stephanie and the list goes on and on because again that number is 14 000 rapes murders molestations that occur each year by somebody let out of prison for doing exactly the same crime sadly the list goes on and on and on too many victims too much suffering we have to do more and we can do it today with passage of this amendment before i close i wanted to express my heartfelt thanks to the survivors the groups and everyone else who has joined with me to fight this fight and to protect families the gentleman from florida chairman mccollum deserves the lions share of the credit for his fine leadership on this issue i wanted to thank my staff for all their hard work i would like to close with a couple of quotes first of all they are not from a famous leader world leader or a law enforcement official but from the very heart of the problem i want to quote a pair of child molesters whose despicable unspeakable crimes cry out for justice there are more than 134 000 convicted sex offenders currently living in our neighborhoods on probation or on parole right now in our neighborhoods let us hear from two of them scheduled for release they have never met but their message could not be more clear i am terrified of being released because i fear without counseling i will molest more children since i dont want to return to prison i would be forced to kill them the next quote i am doomed to eventually rape then murder my poor little victims to keep them from telling on me i might be walking the streets of your city your community your neighborhoods let us pass the amendment today and strike a blow against the revolving door of prisons murders and sexual predators"],

support of the export enhancement act i wish that one of our sage founding fathers benjamin franklin were here today he would find the discussion here interesting and reminiscent he said over 200 years ago no nation was ever ruined by trade indeed that is true international trade is a significant part of american economic growth and prosperity today the programs of opic the trade and development agency and the international trade administration are an integral part of our trade promotion system we need to protect it they have a proven record of strengthening trade and promoting american exports and they certainly warrant reauthorization by this congress since it was created in 1971 opic has backed projects worth 121 billion and helped create approximately 230 000 new unitedstates jobs and 56 billion in exports more than 2 8 billion in american exports were generated by opicsupported projects in 1998 alone more than half of the identified suppliers to opicbacked projects around the world are unitedstates small businesses in this members state alone opic projects have generated about 869 million in exports from the state generating 2 662 jobs examples like that can be given from every state opic is certainly cost beneficial to the american taxpayer in addition to the american jobs opic projects create 100 percent of opics operating costs are covered by user fees to the individual clients meaning these administrative costs are not a burden to the taxpayer in fact opic generates revenue and has generated over 3 3 billion to deficit reduction and other international affairs accounts it is anticipated that in this fiscal year opic will generate an additional 200 million to deficit reduction opic then is a winwin program that is successful in mobilizing the private sector investment in support of unitedstates foreign policy objectives at no operating expense to the american taxpayer opic promotes unitedstates best practices too by requiring projects to adhere to international standards on the environment workers rights and human rights opic projects help improve the stability in developing countries and emerging economies by providing an economic boost to the efforts of reformminded governments for example hungarys opening to the west allowed opic to support unitedstates investment there in 1990 these investments at this critical time of transition certainly helped accelerate the kind of positive economic and political reforms in hungary that transformed that country from a captive warsaw pact satellite into a free nato ally to those who express concern about opicsupported investments abroad luring jobs from america to foreign countries this member recommends they examine closely what kind of investments opic is supporting and what kind of socalled foreign jobs are being created for example the united states cannot supply raw electrical power to egypt however we can supply americanmade power generating equipment and services how can selling power generating equipment made in the unitedstates by american workers and subsequently selling americanmade spare parts and services for this equipment for many years to come be considered taking jobs away from americans if we do not sell the egyptians these power plants then the europeans japanese canadians or other foreign competitors certainly will sell them and their economies will benefit at the expense of ours the united states does not grow tea therefore how does investing in a tea plantation in rwanda steal american jobs indeed it supports unitedstates jobs insofar as that tea operation needs tools machinery trucks and other services these are products and services provided by american firms and produced by american labor the united states is not home to the african savannah and giraffes zebras and baboons are not our native wildlife therefore how does supporting the ecotourism industry in botswana by investing in new hotels and tour operations take away american jobs on the contrary this tourism type of development requires all kinds of infrastructure construction materials furnishings vehicles and a wide range of services everything from financing to marketing these are goods and services that americans produce and can now sell to a new market in botswana all of americas economic competitors including japan germany and france offer a comprehensive array of export and overseas investment support they far outstrip what we offer they certainly recognize the overwhelming benefit to their own economies of such assistance indeed the unitedstates spends less per capita as a percentage of gnp and in dollar terms on supporting private sector investment in developing countries than any other major competitor country the claims have been made that opic is corporate welfare and has eliminated american jobs opponents of opic and the chairman will like this one have cited caterpillar corporation as one of those fat cats benefiting from opic caterpillar makes much of its tractors and heavy equipment in peoria illinois the epitome of an american city and of course in other american cities this member suspects he would be very hard pressed to find among caterpillar workers assembling tractors any of them who would believe that they are the fat cats that are benefiting from opic these are hardworking americans at no cost to the taxpayer opic helps to promote the sale of tractors and earthmoving equipment that they make given the significant support foreign competitors receive from their governments without opic americas caterpillar corporation and its employees are in many instances at a real disadvantage to japans komatsu or koreas hyundai corporation to those who claim that opic is unnecessary or competes against private sector insurance providers this member would point out that opic does not insure against commercial risk or currency devaluation while opic is run like a profitable private business it still needs to provide longterm political risk insurance that is not fully available in the private sector for example with the assurance provided by 1 8 million of opic political risk insurance agro management a minorityowned small business from california is now able to work with ugandan farmers to produce african chrysanthemums from which oil is extracted and used as a natural nontoxic and environmentallyfriendly insecticide this is just one example of many investments that will contribute to the estimated 9 billion in increased trade with subsaharan africa that likely would not occur if it were not for opic insurance similarly the trade and development agency has a successful record of promoting american business involvement in infrastructure projects in developing and middle income countries since its inception the tda has generated over 12 billion in american exports this equates to 32 in unitedstates goods and servicesexported for every 1 spent on tda projects and for every dollar that tda invests the agency receives another 50 cents in costsharing last year alone over 1 8 billion in unitedstates exports were associated with tda activities eighty percent of those exports were comprised of manufactured goods illustrating the strong link between tda projects and unitedstates job creation the international trade administration and foreign commercial service is also reauthorized in this bill this funding supports the actual personnel stationed at unitedstates embassies and unitedstates commercial offices around the globe who successfully promote american goods and services abroad and provide assistance to american businessmen seeking new international trade opportunities h r 1993 the export enhancement legislation before us reauthorizes a successful american export and trade promotion system the economic benefits of this costeffective system to american businessmen workers and farmers have proven to be overwhelming i urge my colleagues to give strong support to this legislation mr wu i rise today on behalf of my home state of oregon and in strong support of h r 1993 the export enhancement act quite simply trade is one of the critical drivers behind oregons current economic prosperity and trade is expected to grow in importance in the years ahead the overseas private investment corporation opic the trade and development agency tda and the international trade administration ita have played a key role in the promotion of oregon exports i strongly urge my colleagues to support this important legislation opic tda and ita play an important part in the promotion of american exports they are good for american workers good for american businesses and good for the american economy each of these very worth agencies requires a relatively small investment but they certainly reap big results for americans i stronglyurge my colleagues to support american exports and support this important bill"], [0.006297120358794928,

person loved by virtually everybody that i knew that served with him in this institution i had the great honor of working with him on the alaska lands bill it was one of the first things that i involved myself in when i came to the congress on the merchant marine committee he of course was a giant one of the giants together with his brother stewart in the environmental movement in this

with him on was the civil service bill in which he showed great leadership great patience with a very young member of congress at that time and his kindness his humor will always be remembered i just want to say to mark his son and to tom his nephew and to the family how much i have been enriched by his presence and his life i will tell my colleagues one quick story if i might on his popularity nobody knew him from adam in my congressional district in 1976 he ran for president came to michigan was a big underdog to jimmy carter the unions heads of the unions the head of the auto companies front page of the detroit papers had endorsed carter he came into that state and taught a message that responded to the common individual and did very very well i think if he did not win he lost by a half a percent i think he may actually have won michigan that year but he won my district with 62 percent and that is significant because 4 years earlier george wallace won my district by the exact same amount it shows as my colleagues know he had a way of reaching people in a very special way with his humor with his passion with his commitment and he will always be remembered in my mind as

the niwot ridge research area and rocky mountain national park they include lands within the second congressional district which i represent these areas are not involved in some conspiracy they are not part of any sinister foreign plot to undermine our constitution or our way of life on the contrary they are places where good things are taking place in the niwot ridge area scientists associated

plight of so many people in north carolina who have suffered greatly through hurricane floyd and the resulting floods no area of the country has been hit as hard even though people all up and down the east coast have suffered from this tragedy and i know that i and other colleagues of mine are determined to do what we can to make sure that north carolinians get the kind of assistance that they need and deserve after this tragedy we are here tonight to talk about another situation that calls for action by this congress and that has to do with the high cost of prescription drugs for seniors in this country thirtyseven percent of our seniors in america have no coverage at all for their prescription drugs to be sure they are on medicare which is a federal health care program they are all on medicare but medicare does not provide for prescription drug coverage and so many people are struggling trying to figure out how to pay the electric bill or the rent or buy food and still take the drugs that their doctors tell them they have to take i started hearing about this issue shortly after i was elected to congress and whenever i talk to seniors groups i might start out talking about medicare reform or social security reform but pretty soon we wound up talking about prescription drugs because it was a daily worry for so many people who thought that when they retired they would have enough money to make ends meet but many of them do not i have had people write to me and say that between themselves and their husband they have 600 a month in prescription drug expenses and they only have 1300 or 1350 in a social security check the math does not work they cannot do it i have had women write to me and say i do not want my husband to know but i am not taking my prescription medication because he is sicker than i am and we cannot both afford to take our medications so last year when th6 democratic staff on the committee on government reform and oversight came to me and said we would like to do a study for you of some kind in your district to call attention to a problem or to deal with an issue that you think needs attention i asked them to do a study on prescription drugs and the results were astonishing what we found is that for the 5 or the 10 makes no difference for the 5 most commonly prescribed prescription drugs for seniors seniors on average pay twice as much for their medications as the pharmaceutical companys best customers the best customers are hmos hospital chains and yes the federal government itself and let us take a look before turning to some of my colleagues who are here with me tonight let us just take a look at the chart which shows a comparison between the average retail price that older americans pay in my first district in maine compared to the prices that the drug companies charge their mostfavored customers whether you pick zocor or norvasc or prilosec or procardia xl or zoloft in any event when you add those up the average price differential in my district when this was taken last year is over 100 percent seniors are paying twice as much for their drugs as the drug companys best customers a subsequent study showed that seniors in maine pay 72 percent more than citizens in canada for the same drugs same amount same quantity and they pay 102 percent more than mexicans do for their medications same drug same quantity same quality that study has now been replicated in a number of areas around the country and with me tonight are the gentleman from texas who has done a lot of work on this issue becn a leader on the prescription drug issue and the gentlewoman from florida who has had a study done in her district and is working hard to make sure that seniors get the kind of coverage they deserve ej 2100 before turning over to the gentlewoman from florida i would say as a result of these studies we all worked together and developed legislation called the prescription drug fairness for seniors act h r 664 which has 125 cosponsors in the house this is a bill that creates no new federal bureaucracy it involves virtually no expense to the federal government but it puts the federal government on the side of seniors on medicare in fact all medicare beneficiaries basically the federal government would negotiate reduced prices for seniors as a block the legislation is very simple it allows pharmacies to buy drugs for medicare beneficiaries at the best price given to the federal government we think this would probably lead to price reductions for seniors in their prescription medication by up to 40 percent at virtually no cost to the federal government with no new federal bureaucracy this is a bill that is simple costfree but the opposition is unbelievable we will get into the opposition and the big money opposition that is trying to stop this legislation i would now like to yield to the gentlewoman from florida who has been working very hard to make sure that her constituents in florida get

secretary of defense as regards funds in fiscal year 1999 defense appropriations it increases the existing transfer authority ceiling to 2 45 billion this is really a technical provision we customarily every year provide the department with a 2 billion transfer authority what this then does is provide the secretary of defense and the military services with the ability to propose the routine reprogramming of funds subject to prior congressional approval section 201 of the bill raises the existing transfer authority to 2 45 billion the dod needs this additional authority principally to accommodate the burden of several unanticipated reprogramming needs which we had to deal with earlier this year relating to the war on drugs and the dod response to hurricane mitch but the important fact here is that this additional authority is not a blank check for the dod to move around money i when the dod wants to reprogram funds any significant amount over 5 million for reprogramming the secretary must come back to the congressional committees there are four committees that are involved the house and senate appropriations committees and the house and senate armed services committees these committees must approve the proposed reprogramming the people who deal with it day in and day out in a professional way we do not want to bind the department of defense and make them totally paralyzed in an emergency circumstance but we still want the congress to have a chance to have oversight i know some may believe this provision is somehow intended to give the administration additional authorities with respect to kosovo that is not the administrations intent nor is it the committees intent this is really a technical fix i cannot tell members that the

that are part of the agency itself it is working out very well and of course it is important because fires in a forest or a park for that matter can spread beyond the borders we have seen that a lot

approved for a range of medical uses we do not deny narcotics to cancer patients because it could send a signal to others who might wish to use these drugs recreationally yet that is what this amendment would say with regard to marijuana with all due respect i do not believe that anyone who had watched an aids or cancer patient suffer uncontrollable nausea for hours at a time could make such an argument proponents of the amendment are quick to point out that the scientific community is divided over the medical benefits of marijuana they are less quick to acknowledge that both the benefits and the dangers of a large number of medical substances are subject to scientific dispute i submit that it is not the job of the congress to resolve such disputes we could argue all day about the science but that is not our role it is not our role to prohibit scientists from continuing to develop sound data regarding the safety and efficacy of marijuanaas they do with any other experimental treatment and it is both foolish and inhumane for us to prevent licensed physicians and their patients from studying the growing literature weighing the benefits and the risks and deciding whether the use of such drugs is medically appropriateespecially when more conventional therapies have been found ineffective if we are determined to override these local decisions and to replace sound medical judgment with our own lets at least not be hypocritical lets take morphine and cocaine off the market as well lets explain to the patients who depend on these drugs to control their pain that they will simply have to suffer so that we can send the right signal about drug abuse im sure theyll understand"], [0.0030893683433532715, 0.5030893683433533, 1, "i rise with great concern about the omissions that are found in this rule in particular the lack of allowing the amendment of the gentlewoman from new york to make fair the process of procurement in the federal government we rarely do this in other instances why would we try to penalize a good neighbor and a good corporate citizen like smith and wesson which has committed itself to safer guns to protect the lives of our children i do not know i am saddened by the fact that that has occurred and i would hope that my colleagues would see the wisdom in allowing us to debate such issues i am gratified however with the sanchezmorella amendment which restores equal access to equal services of overseas military hospitals to servicemen and women and their dependents i rise today to salute the gentleman from mississippi for his persistence and for where we are in being allowed to debate a vital issue and i ask my colleagues to support the taylor amendment which provides lifetime health care for military retirees i want to put a face on military retirees they are the everyman they are in rural america they are in urban america they are the bus drivers many of them they are the day workers and laborers across the nation they are the teachers yes the doctors and lawyers but they are the everyday american i have many of them in my constituency it bothers me when i begin to hear the balancing or the nonbalancing of the numbers we know that this program if put in place will merely cost us an additional 20 million yes we have arrears of 100 million but might i say to the american people there is a distinction between arrears and debt arrears is we have not been paying and we have a problem with hcfa we have a problem with hcfa my small health care businesses who tell me every single day i am being closed down i cannot care for the elderly because hcfa is not paying the real issue is not debt to medicare it is the question that hcfa is not paying its bills i want my military retirees those who were in korea those who were in vietnam those who were in the persian gulf those who were in kosovo i want them to have the dignity and the respect of being called their title and the kind of treatment they get at military hospitals on base if they so desire i am going to roll up my sleeves and i do not know about the rest of my colleagues i encourage them to rise to their feet and support the taylor amendment because those people are our neighbors and they have been committed to they have been told that this would be a lifetime provision and benefit and i do not know why we would deny it i think it is important to not misuse the figures and the dollars and i am gratified that we have been able to have this opportunity i certainly would not take that away from the committee on rules and i do thank them i hope that as we debate this issue that as we move toward honoring oqr men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice this memorial day that we will say to the living veterans we thank you we thank you we thank you because the ability to debate on the floor of the house the freedom of all of us in the united states of america is because our men and women have been willing to put themselves on the line for freedom i am going to put myself on the line to vote for the taylor amendment to ensure that they have the dignity of fulltime military health benefits throughout their entire lifetime i would ask my colleagues to do so"], [0.004126906394958496, 0.5041269063949585, 0, "i am sorry to say that the white house talks a great game when it comes to education reform but it turns out there is more going on behind the scenes that you will never see on the network news the white house has been working with democrats in the congress to take the flex out of ed flex the whole purpose of this program is to give the states their own authority to assess their programs instead of washington telling them what they need now 100 000 new teachers is a great slogan but trying to handcuff our governors like this is not exactly the kind of flexibility that reformers have in mind when they advocate ed flex this program is supposed to allow local schools to spend federal dollars as they see fit the special interests will have none of that but the special interests are not putting the education needs of our children first ed flex does it is a

that has been agreed to by all the parties the oslo peace accords by which the parties would sit down one across the table from the other and resolve their differences peaceably our action today does not prejudice what will happen in those discussions we wish them well what we are doing today is saying as a nation a few things number one that the free people of the united states of america will not tolerate the abuse of the united nations by those nations who wish to use that forum to bash the only democracy in themiddle east who happens to be americas number one military economic and

hard time getting this bill enacted i also rise in strong support of the national endowment of the arts and humanities i believe that they deserve this extra support by the way this very controversial project in brooklyn has not received any funding from the national endowment for the arts the museum has received support on other projects but one of the things that the chairman and i supported him

amendment and say the issue that we are talking about is very very important in fact this bill is very important but somehow it is very difficult for us to understand that foreign affairs and foreign relations the monies we spend in aid really enable us as a country to be far more secure the issue we are talking about tonight about debt relief is a tool we have used to further our relationship with a number of countries historically we do this as a way of enabling the country to be responsive we do that as a way of enabling us to have better relationships we did that with the soviet union we have done that with other countries we do that historically but here we are with a unique opportunity in a unique time the year of the jubilee 2000 all of the religious groups and i would say to the distinguished gentleman from alabama chairman of the subcommittee not only did the poor support this but the protestant religions support this the nonprofit groups support this because it is the right thing to do it is right to indeed share what one has with others but the year of jubilee is a time 50year time that says that we reexamine the debt we have as a part of our sharing our wealth with the world i think that as we consider this we have to consider when we relieve the debt we are enabling those countries to be responsible in selfdevelopment of their country by investing in their education investing in their health or otherwise we are taking the monies that we know they cannot afford to pay indeed paying a debt oftentimes that has gone in by another regime that was completely

a phony limit that was produced in the original budget resolution in the spring and the house pretended that it was going to live with the spending limit or discretionary funds laid out in that resolution but we all know that for the third year in a row that understated the reality by about 40 billion in terms of what the congress would eventually do now following that pretense for a long period of time this year we now have been given a new construct by the majority party leadership they have said well under our new 90 10 arrangement for use of our surplus 28 billion will be available plus 13 billion because they are recomputing the base from which they were operating that gives us about 40 billion on the table which can be used for tax actions or for spending actions or for entitlement actions the problem is that that is outlays we measure the deficit in outlays but because we do not spend all of the money that we appropriate in any given year there is a difference between what the committee actually appropriates and what is actually outlaid in any given fiscal year so because of that difference what is really on the table is up to 80 billion in additional spending the problem is no one knows what the plans are for using that huge amount of money so we are asked to approve a bill at a time i voted against the energywater bill because i did not know whether we ought to be providing that much money in that bill when we still did not know what the other bills were going to look like so we are drifting along with no idea of what the limits are no context no limits no discipline someone in the leadership office having some idea of what the game plan is that changes from day to day but we do not know so we cannot tell our constituents and the press certainly does not know so in the end we will do what about six anonymous people in the leadership office tells us will be done but that is not the way we ought to run a railroad or a legislative body we ought to be able to know what the limits are so that we can choose within those limits that is not a privilege which is being afforded us there is not much we can do about that on the minority side of the aisle but it is an irresponsible way to run what is supposed to be the greatest legislative body in the world is the gentleman from florida going to yield back"]]}
