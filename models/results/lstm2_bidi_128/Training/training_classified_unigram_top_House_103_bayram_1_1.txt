simple guarantee that you will not have to live in fear oflosing your job when you are forced to take a brief leave for a legitimate family or medical reason a simple guarantee that you will not lose your health insurance benefits just when your family needs them most a simple guarantee that makes sense for american workers and american business with a family and medical leave benefit business

shown that employers with generous leave policies have more productive and satisfied employees in order for unitedstates businesses to compete globally in the 21st century we must start with nothing

let the american people know that the impact of the nafta agreement the north american freetrade agreement will be devastating on the economy of this country american workers are the best in the world and they can compete and they can win in the new global marketplace if they aregiven a chance if the playing field is fair and level but nafta threatens to take away that chance threatens to put us at a tremendous disadvantage why because primarily there is a systematic policy in mexico to keep wages low the minimum wage is just 58 cents an hour even in the highest paying jobs mexican workers earn less in a day than american workers earn in an hour because productivity is rising rapidly in mexico and why should it not be the multinationals are pouring their investment dollars into mexico chasing after these very low wages building the newest plants with the best equipment there while our plants in our industrial belt and other places around the country are left to rust no american workers will not be given a chance if nafta is ratified the people in my district know the story well workers at the chesterfield trlm plant it is a ford plant in my district which i have visited on occasion they build seats and other interior auto parts these sections of the plant have been idled for numerous shifts in recent years while ford is turning out a similar product component in mexico you go up the road a little west in my district and you come across the trw plant in washington township less than 100 workers are still making seatbelts there it used to be a huge operation you guessed it trw is now making most of those seatbelts in mexico instead i could go on and on and i know the gentlewoman from toledo oh who we will hear from in a little while can talk about the specifics with respect to plant shutdowns all across the country it is not just jobs it is the vitality of whole communities that is at stake anybody who has seen the devastation that results when plants shut down in places like youngstown oh or mckeesport pa or flint or marion oh or anyplace in the industrial belt of this country the places that made the great middle class in this country that made america great and an industrial power knows the pain knows what i am talking about if this agreement goes through and we will hear some of those stories tonight what we hear will leave us no

shaiken is with the center for united statesmexican studies at the university of california in san diego he did a study that backs up with facts what most americans and most american workers have known all along that the ratification of nafta poses a very real and a very immediate threat to american jobs good jobs american manufacturing jobs the kind of jobs that you raise families with that you buy homes with that you put a little aside so you can send your kids to college now this research documents three main points no 1 mexicos newest manufacturing facilities the newest ones they are building down there are every bit as sophisticated as plants here at home the second point mexicos wages are only a fraction of the wages here in the united states a very small fraction no 3 wages make a big difference even in hightechnology manufacturing add these three points together and you get one conclusion nafta will gobble up american jobs faster than the dinosaurs in jurassic park will gobble up people now mexicos newest manufacturing facilities are very sophisticated newer mexican manufacturing facilities are every bit as sophisticated as the plants as i have said right here at home in fact because of the way the current investment dollars are pouring into mexico the true state of the art technology is more likely to be found in mexico than here in the united states you take

in support of h r 2264 the budg at reconciliation act i am here to explain to my colleagues some of the budget cuts achieved by the committee on education and labor the conferees met the target of 5 8 billion in savings largely by moving toward a system of direct loans to replace governmentguaranteed loans the guaranteed loan system involves 7 800 lenders 46 guarantee agencies and numerous servicers and secondary markets this exercise has revealed to me in its full glory and for the first time the layer after layer after layer of profit making that stands between students borrowing money to go to school and the money they receive and i can assure my colleagues that we have taken serious steps here to recover some of that profit for the students and for the american taxpayer under this system the existing system the federal government guarantees lenders against losses that might result from defaults so it is an entitlement program the entitlement runs to the lenders under the system that we have put now in place to ultimately replace this the entitlement that we are talking about runs to the student not to the lenders not to the people who are in this business to make a profit now i find it very interesting to hear members on that side of the aisle talking about how much more they wanted to cut and i had a letter when i went to conference signed by 148 republicans who told me not to take the housepassed version that saved 5 8 billion but to take the senate version which saved much less i ise in support of h r 2264 the budget reconciliation act i am here to explain to my colleagues some of the budget cuts achieved by the committee on education and labor the conferees met the target of 5 8 billion in savings largely by moving toward a system of direct loans to replace governmentguaranteed loans the guaranteed loan system involves 7 800 lenders 46 guaranty agencies and numerous servicers and secondary markets in this complex setup students directly or indirectly apply for a loan to a bank or other qualified lender loans are insured by a guaranty agency reinsured by the education department and frequently resold in secondary markets under this system the federal government guarantees lenders against losses that might result from defaults the key to making it all work is the govemmenrs generous allowance to the banks the tbill rate plus 3 1 percent along with loan origination and other fees that is what students pay for the privilege of borrowing money to help them get an education picking up a proposal originally made by the bush adrinistrationbut then disbanded when the moneylenders put pressure on the republican white housepresident clinton proposed to phase in a system of direct loans to replace guaranteed loans the system has a number of advantages it saves the government 2 billion per year when fully implemented it reduces students borrowing costs and it eliminates a system that is open to fraud and abuse by unscrupulous lenders president clintons proposal and the house bill would have phased in direct loans over 4 years providing the education department time to gear up for the new system and to prove its efficiency and effectiveness it also would have preserved the guaranteed loan system throughout the phasein of direct loans maintaining the value of the 60 billion in outstanding loans in the secondary markets and generating another 30 billion in loans before full phasein it would have produced profits for these lenders well into the 21st century thus the basic integrity of the existing system would have been protected while we moved to a better one after a protracted conference with the senate we have returned with a hybrid the conference agreement provides a beginning for direct loans in the 199495 school year 5 percent of the student loan volume will be provided by direct loans increasing to 40 percent in 199596 50 percent in the following 2 years and 60 percent in 199899 beginning in 199697 educational institutions can choose to opt in to the direct loan system because this slower phaselin would provide less savings to the government the conference agreement includes a number of fees to banks and guaranty agencies that were approved by the senate some of these fees also were proposed by the gentleman from tennessee who i believe hoped to preserve the current system ironically his proposal would have undermined the system by reducing profits to the banks guaranty agencies and secondary markets perhaps causing them to leave the market during the conference i stressed repeatedly my opposition to these cuts in bank profits because i was concerned about the effect on the availability of loans let me detail these budget cuts and fees an upfront user fee on lenders of halfpercent of their new loan volume saves 585 million sallie mae the governmentchartered institution that buys student loans will pay fees of 0 3 percent of their outstanding loan volume savings 755 million the 9 5percent floor on yields on loans made with taxexempt bonds is eliminated producing 350 million in savings the guaranty agency administration cost allowance and reinsurance fees are eliminated saving 910 million the guaranty agency reinsurance fee is eliminated saving 300 million holders of consolidation loans will pay fees equal to 1 05 percent of their outstanding new loan principal saving 1 255 billion federal loan reinsurance is reduced from 100 90 80 percent to 98 88f78 percent and the federal loan guarantee on all holders of loans is reduced from 100 to 98 percent except for lenderoflastresort loans saving 245 million the agreement requires multiple disbursement of plus loans saving 100 million it lowers the guaranty agency default collection retention allowance from 30 to 27 percent saving 215 million it reduces the bonuses based on the tbill rate from 3 1 to 2 5 percent during the prepayment period reducing government costs by 495 million it changes the preclaims payment from 50 per claim to 1 percent of collection saving 28 million finally states must share the costs of institutions whose default rate exceeds 20 percent saving taxpayers 300 million the banking lobby put tremendous pressure on some of the conferees and in general on the congress to maintain their current highly profitable entitlement one company in indiana hired lobbyists in washington to spend 750 000 to defeat direct lending the ohiobased student loan funding corp went so far as to establish a front organization ostensibly composed of students to advertise and lobby for the status quo members of my committee were deluged with calls from homedistrict bankers and student loan administrators urging them to maintain what is after credit cards the banking industrys second biggest profit center the status quo however would leave us without the budget savings required of the committee and that is the main reason we went through this exercise in the abstract budget cuts are very popular but when it comes to speclfigs the special interests crawl out of the woodwork the direct lending proposal is no different as a result of their campaign of disinformation and of the legitimate concerns of people cautious about adopting a new system the conferees have emerged with a program that may be destabilizing for lenders which in turn poses risks for students who attend institutions that banks historically have judged as risky i am concerned that lenders will decline to lend to their students my concern is partly relieved because of the provision that allows all institutions to opt in to direct lending in 199697 that should ensure that every institution that desires to participate in the direct lending program will have that choice i want to note to my colleagues who remain concerned about direct loans that before the 5 years of this agreement have expired the congress will reauthorize the higher education act that review will take place in 1997 within 4 years we will have the opportunity to examine the direct loan program ultimately accepting this hybrid allows us to meet the savings required by the budget resolution this policy was created in the shadow of the mandate to produce budget cuts as unfortunate as it is to write policy according to budget requirements we have been able to initiate a good and workable system of direct loans that in essence the administration sought and the house approved it lowers costs to taxpayers taxpayers are not the only beneficiaries of direct loans throughout this process the committee the house and the conferees have sought to promote the interests of all those aspiring to improve their education the people at the heart of this program students origination and insurance feesthe amount taken off the topwill be cut in half from a maximum of about 240 to 120 their interest costs also will be reduced by limiting the rates lenders can charge besides facing lower costs students will be offered flexible repayment options they will be able to work out a schedule that increases their loan payments as their income rises or that are longer than under current law or that are contingent upon their income observers of congress tend to become obsessed with the process or as president clinton put it in his inaugural address whos in and whos out whos up and whos down did the house or the senate position win in the conference my first concern as chairman of the committee on education and labor is to ensure that this budget reconciliation does no harm to the students whose interests guide our policy considerations the purpose of the student loan program is to make college more affordable for americans who need help to meet its everigrowing costs student loans took a lot of hits under president reagan under president clinton with this budget bill and other proposals we are considering this year schooltowork and national service to name twowe are restarting the long process of investing in our people i am most pleased that we are lowering the costs of higher education or job training which we all agree is a key to a more prosperous economy and better living standards for our people the essential byproduct is that we are saving the taxpayers money again i must say that i do not like the way we have had to produce these savingsi do not endorse the use of

cowed like the senate was in terms of voting for the special interests on this policy the existing policy with regard to the grazing on our public lands and those permitted to graze cattle makes a mockery of sound policy that is why this proposal that the gentleman from ohio is offering and the effort to work in good faith with the secretary of the interior on this has received support of the taxpayers union has received the support of citizens against government waste and has received of course the very strong support of virtually every conservation and environmental group in this country those who are opposed to it are those that benefit from it who are they they are big companies they are special interests it is not just the little individualthe small rancher in fact secretary babbitt by going out west and trying to develop a process in terms of input and hearing has in fact done yeomans work in terms of trying to place this issue in an open public forum this policy was yielded upon and removed from the reconciliation bill and the administration stated they were going to deal with it in the normal coursethe regular administrative process or through changes in law now we have the senate attempting to slam dunk through the appropriations process a failed policy and continue the denial that they have made with regard to what the solution should be what the policy should be with regards to the cost of grazing and using public lands it is not just that this freezes the process for 1 year the fact is the effect of this is there will be no change in grazing policy in 1993 no change in 1994 and probably no change in even even under the best of circumstances going through the environmental impact statements and the other procedures the earliest that this policy if this were permitted to proceed in an administrative vein would be in july 1994 that is when the policy could be put into effect if you freeze this through a moratorium and say that the secretary of the interior and the administration cannot even study the problem until next october and this particular proposal what is going to happen we are not going to have then another 10 months another year it is going to be 1995 if ever to see a policy change of course i think something could shake up the other body over there the senate and something miraculous could descend on them and they all of a sudden could come out for good public policy in terms of managing the range but we have problems on the range today and that has not happened in the past decade regarding public grazing issues in fact the house has repeatedly sent bills over there trying to engage the senate in dealing with this issue in a legislative manner they have rejected that they have been in a state of denial the last administration sympathized with the special interests in terms of management of public land and specifically regarding grazing permit charges they gave in to political concerns and the taxpayer and the range ecosystem have paid the price i hope the house will vote for the regula motion and vote for sound public policy on the range today and tomorrow our conferees on the interior appropriation bil definitely should reject the inconceived senate attempt to kill public land range reform the senate amendment is simply yet another attempt to block effective steps toward reform of grazing and rangeland management just as the senate has blocked such steps for the past decade home on the westem range reform is long overdue the taxpayers are being shortchanged because the current system keeps grazing fees far below fair market value not only below the price of private forage but below what most western states themselves charge for grazing on their state lands lands which are intermingled with the national rangelands and are similar to the naonal lands in character and value these state lands are often the mirror image of national range lands that are being leased on the cheap the house has repeatedly voted to scrap this obsolete system and to establish grazing fees that would more closely reflect market value the new administrations proposals would finally move in that same direction but the senate amendment would actually block the administration from even developing those range reform involves more than grazing fees in fact while grazing fee increases are certainly jti and needed they are less significant than other proposed changes in range management these changes4ncluding greater public involvement greater protection for the riangeland riparian areas that are so valuable for wildlife and the environment less pressure on arid public rangeland and using gazingfee receipts for better land managementhave also been supported by the house and are addressed in the administrations preliminary reform proposals the senate amendment would block all administrative steps toward these much needed reforms it would prohibit the administration from taking any action involved in connection with developing its grazing reform initiative wile the dollars are important the rational land management of these hundreds of millions of acres of public land is imperative the senate proposal not only means that present policies could not be changed it means that no proposals for change could be developed and in fact that nobody in the administration could even review and consider the comments of the livestock industry or any other public comments related to development of a final proposal for rangeland reform this type of narrow special interest control of americas public lands is repugnant and a slap in the face to the secretary of the interiors good faith effort to provide deliberate consideration of revisions to the grazing policies the house should surely reject this amendment we should expect and encourage secretades babbitt and espy to consider public comments that are submitted over the next month to develop a draft environmental impact statement one that itself will be subject to further public comments and to complete development of a complete reform proposal let us not hogtie the new secretary of the interlor who is trying to end gridlock ana change public land policies through an open fair process congress can participate in this process and also can address grazing reform through legislaion if there is a sincere desire to do so several house grazing reform bills are pending including one i introduced along with the gentleman from georgia on which hearings already have been held also pending is a bill for a 4year reauthorization of the bureau of land management it also would be an appropriate measure for addressing grazing fees and rangeland reform comparable bills are pending in the senate including the 2year blm reauthorization bill just passed by the house so despite what some have said the senate amendment is not needed to preserve congress options the senate in fact has repeatedy rejected positive initiatives to engage in constructive grazing policy reform rather it has been satisfied to permit special interest to bully past administrations into maintaining faulty grazing fees in my opinion it would be better for congress to enact rangeland reform rather than for needed changes to be made solely by the administration and the house has been and i think still isready to act on grazing reform the problem has been in the senate the problem clearly still is in the senate as demonstrated by the amendment that is the subject of this motion to instruct house conferees some supporters of the senate amendment claimed that the amendment was not intended to stall rangeland reform they said that they intended to seek the passage of legislation i hope that is true i hope that this time finally they will succeed in having the senate pass a range reform bill i am sure the house is ready to act but if wefali to instruct conferees and serve notice about our opposition to this senate attempt to kill range reform both the house and the positive new administration policies of reform could be slam dunked through the appropriation process and avoid for a full year any administrative reform in fact it takes 10 months to fully properly implement the change in grazing fees if all goes well the senate freeze would mean that the administration could not take action for 2 years no action in 1993 no action in 1994 and no action until maybe 1995 a big maybe the administration should be allowed to go forward with development of its own reform proposals we should not prevent that in tact we should be encouraging secretary babbitt and the rest of the administration to continue with their efforts the senate amendment would bring to an absolute stop this administration initiative it is certainly unwise and premature the house should instruct our conferees to soundly reject it"], [0.046875953674316406, 0.9531240463256836, 1, "our judiciary system is a significant part of the complex

"on april 11 1994 the board of trustees of the federal oldage and survivors insurance and disability insurance trust funds released their 1994 annual report this report should be required reading for all members because it details the financial condition of the largest single part of our countrys domestic spending program most importantly it documents that social security our largest entitlement program faces a large and growing longterm deficit we should not be alarmed but we must be concerned and should act promptly according to the trustees report the programs deficit has now risen to 2 13 percent of our nations total taxable payroll over the next 75 years this means that projected expenditures now exceed expected revenues by an amount equal to 2 13 percent of the total payroll which is subject to the oasdi payroll tax the program has not been in close actuarial balance for several years and it is now obvious to all that significant changes must be made to address the programs growing deficit it is for this reason that i introduced legislation today h r 4275 which would make several fundamental longterm changes to the program the major provisions of the legislation would first gradually raise the age of normal retirement from 67 to 70 while continuing to allow for early retirement at age 62 second award costoflivingadjustments on a biennial basis except in years of high inflation with colas to be made in july rather than in january third extend social security coverage to newly hired state and local employees and fourth reduce the spousal benefit from 50 percent to 33 percent of the covered workers benefit these provisions would be gradually phased in beginning in the year 2000 and would not be fully effective until after 2021 none of these changes would significantly affect current retirees or those workers who are now near retirement the bill would reduce total social security expenditures by 2 12 percent of taxable payroll an amount almost exactly equal to the currently projected deficit in the oasdi trust funds in proposing these changes i deliberately chose not to include any tax increase or any change which would have an immediate impact i did this to avoid any impression that these proposals were being made for budget reasons i took this approach so that the bill would focus exclusively on the longterm problems we face in our entitlement programs most notably with social security we must make decisions now on how to responsibly finance a benefit structure which meets the retirement income security needs of workers in our society i think this is important because there is currently a great deal of public discussion about potential changes to all these programs for example there are those who believe that older wealthier americans ought to be called on to bear a greater part of the burden in reducing the federal deficit to accomplish this end they would meanstest and cut social security and medicare benefits in order to help balance the federal budget while it may well be that additional sacrifices by todays older americans may be necessary as part of a wellbalanced plan to solve our federal budget problems in my judgment making immediate reductions in their benefits is not the best way to accomplish this goal it is important to note that with regard to social security the trust funds are currently running large surpluses and are not contributing to the federal deficit therefore there is no reason to frighten the elderly with the prospect of reducing their colas or meanstesting their benefits likewise there is no reason to impose the enormous administrative burden of meanstesting on the already strained social security administration that would inevitably result if means testing were imposed nor should we allow inflation to erode the benefits of the oldest and poorest social security beneficiaries in our efforts to balance the budget if we wish to tax older wealthier americans there are far more efficient and direct ways to accomplish this purpose in addition others believe that our entitlement programs are growing too rapidly and that we must cut them back personally i agree that we must control the growth of entitlement programs or we will leave our children and grandchildren with an impossible financial burden that is why h r 4275 contains no tax increases this bill would reduce the size of the social security entitlement program i think this is important because we will never be able to cut back on all the other entitlement programs if we do not take some action with respect to social security finally if we take action now to gradually raise the age of normal retirement young workers will have the opportunity to make their own retirement plans based on their own work and savings they will not be as dependent on social security and the federal government when they retire in the meantime their savings will be invested primarily in publicly traded securities which will help to provide the capital our economy needs in order to grow while each one of these changes will certainly generate considerable discussion and perhaps even opposition they are based on sound social security policy in each case they are a response to the changing nature of our society and economy if adopted in the near future and phased in gradually our economy and society will absorb them with little or no disruption if the reforms contained in h r 4275 are adopted soon they will first put an end to the fears of the elderly that their benefits will be cut at a time when they can no longer increase their retirement savings second put an end to the growing cynicism younger workers have with respect to the longterm viability of the social security system and third avoid the need to make more sudden and drastic changes in the future for all these reasons i would urge members to begin to give this legislation and this issue serious

bringing to justice those who have planned perpetuated and taken part in war crimes crimes against humanity and even genocide in the former yugoslavia as my colleagues here know for more than a year and a half i have been calling for the establishment of an international tribunal empowered to bring individual wrongdoers to justice many in this body have called for the same if we are in a new world order it will be a world in which international crimes are not committed without justice being applied last week we were brought one step closer to this goal eleven judges were sworn in who pledged to impose legal sanctions on those who have shocked the conscience of humanity with the atrocities they have committed in this conflict in the former yugoslavia if in the 1930s when genocide began we had had the oversight of the international community and the commitment to call to account those who would treat their fellow human beings so savagely perhaps just perhaps millions of lives might have been saved i realize of course that the obstacles this tribunal faces are daunting so daunting in fact that its inaugural meeting has been met with doubt in many quarters as to whether it will be able to meet the goals set for it in its statute in fact i must confess that i share some of those concerns the tremendous delays experienced during the election of judges and the appointment of the chief prosecutor are indicative of the barriers erected by those at the u n both within the u n bureaucracy and among the u n member states who did not want this tribunal established at all and frankly i think do not want it to succeed now although the security council had pledged to reflect the diversity of the worlds legal systems in the election of judges the final panel confirmed by the general assembly includes only two women and inexplicably not one single moslem efforts to select a chief prosecutor were equally disheartening the security council deadlocked twice before it could reach agreement on a third nominee reflecting the lack of a common sense of purpose in that body even today the tribunal still has insufficient resources insufficient staffing and insufficient support from the members of the security council itself in spite of all this i am not and i hope others are notprepared to say that this tribunal cannot succeed because i believe that many of the problems it faces can be addressed in part if not totally the united states must continue to lead the way both in terms of the information we make available to the tribunal as we have to the commission of experts and in terms of financial resources material and expert staffing in this regard i know of no other country that has provided as much support for this effort as has the united states but even we can do more the united states should undertake an interagency review of its classified materials in order to determine if critical information on war crimes has been unnecessarily withheld we know for a fact that this had occurred in the postworld war h history of this country this information should be made publicly available to the united nations as have previous reports on war crimes prepared by the united states in addition the united states should seek to make available to the court and to the chief prosecutor experts of the highest caliber drawing not only from within its own ranks but from the nongovernmental community as well in this way the united states can set a positive example for other countries whose proclaimed support for prosecuting war crimes has not yet been translated into positive deeds but perhaps the most consequential undertaking that awaits the united states and the other members of the security council is the adoption of provisions for the apprehension of alleged war criminals cooperation with the tribunal established under chapter vii of the u n charter is required by all countries but we know from experience that not all countries will in fact cooperate it is imperative therefore that consideration be given todaynot next week or next month or yearfor the establishment of a specific regime to which recourse can be made by the security council to implement the warrants for arrest detention surrender or transfer of persons sought for trial by this tribunal no country must be permitted to become a safe haven for those indicted for war crimes let it be true of international law that those who harbor protect and further the criminal enterprise of those who commit genocide against the peoples of this world let them too be branded equally guilty of such heinous crimes an undertaking of this scope is unprecedented of course and will require innovative approaches to be successful indeed innovative approaches will be essential if a new world order is to be realized it is conceivable that the conference on security and cooperation in europe could play a significant role in this process possibly contributing to the formulation of such a regime or its ultimate implementation some have suggested that this kind of planning will in the end be unnecessary they imply that the perpetratore of these crimes have not left a documentary paper trail that would enable any court to convict them of course few murderers do i do not believe however that without a written confession we can never bring people to justice in many of the cases arising from this war i believe there will be ample evidence to issue indictments and arrest warrants and in many of those cases i believe convictions can and will be sustained for starters we have the graves of theusands of noncombatantscivilians neighbors like ours children like ours mothers like ours fathers like ours sisters like ours brothers like ourswho were purposely willfully and criminally killed in the war in the former yugoslavia the u n commission of experts working with physicians for human rights has been engaged in the arduous process of gathering forensic evidence on graves such as these evidence that may ultimately link silenced victims with their living killers we also of course have survivors eyewitnesses and a significant body of intelligence about what troops were where and whenplacing the suspects if you will at the scene of the crime in particular i believe the chief prosecutor of the tribunal can and should immediately launch investigations into those figures about whom the most information has already been gathered anonymity for war criminals is an important aspect for their success i would like to name briefly here some of those figures whose role in this war has been documented by helsinki watch reports by the new york times and other newspapers by the recent book of pulitzer prize winning newsday correspondent roy gutman entitled a witness to genocide let me say parenthetically that in todays world we have all been witnesses to genocide there is no excuse to say if we had only known if we had only seen if we had only heard of the deaths of children the starving of peoples the commission of crimes finally documentation comes from an april 1993 video report entitled a town called kozarac produced for the british television program dispatches the following people are among the most notorious zeljko raznjatovic also known as arkan stands here he is welldressed has a fancy uniform a shaven face a close haircut perhaps he is someone who we would otherwise think is just another person he has already been branded an international criminal he robbed banks in belgium and the netherlands for which he was imprisoned and committed several burglaries in sweden and germany in early 1992 his group was responsible for a major massacre of moslems in the town of bijeljina and elsewhere in bosnia and herzegovina arkan is a perpetrator of war crimes a person who has furthered genocide in the best tradition of adolph hitler vojislav seselj is head of the fascist serbian radical party and its paramilitary wing known as the serbian chetnik movement his people have operated throughout bosnia and herzegovina during the course of the war committing atrocities not against military personnel but against the civilian population seselj is a war criminal in the best tradition of adolph hitler mladjo krkan is an omarska camp guardlike other guards at other prison camps about whom we have talked he was known to be particularly brutal and is implicated in the murder of two prisoners but one thing we always know when it comes to war crimes is that unfortunately most are secret done out of the light of witnesses or other observers surviving prisoners in one british documentary said that most of the atrocities at the omarska camp occurred during krkans shift krkan is a war criminal in the best tradition of adolph hitler gen ratko mladlc is the head of the bosnian serb military according to the new york times he is often called the ethnic cleanser in chief ethnic cleansing what an interesting phrase cleansing is a word that most of us feel makes things better but what it has meant here is the genocide of a people the expelling of a people through death and injury from the homelands in which they and their ancestors had lived for centuries why because of their ethnicity because they were a different kind of people and because an inv ding force wanted to sanitize a geographic region for their own people before moving to the bosnian front mladic was commander of the yugoslav army in the serbcontrolled region of krajina in croatia where he earned the additional title of butcher of knin the troops under his control are responsible for many of the atrocities we hear about in bosnia and herzegovina and as i said that we witness on cnn on nbc on cbs on abc on bbc and other countless television programs brought into our very homes brought to this nation and nations around the world radovan karadzic is the bosnian serb political leader he is cold calculating and at best amoral savaging others through puppets for political ends he is a familiar face from his presence at the negotiations in geneva trained as a psychiatrist he is perhaps the person most responsible for ordering the atrocities that have been committed in bosniaherzegovina karadzic is from the serb population of bosniaherzegovina but he is the agent clearly of the next person slobodan milosevic with whom i have met slobodan milosevic is more than the president of serbia he is the hitler of yugoslavia the mastermind of the plan for a greater serbia milosevic has been the single most culpable figure in orchestrating this war make no mistake america make no mistake my colleagues if he had wanted to do so he could have brought an end to the conflict not all the killing the atrocities that have been committed in bosnia and herzegovina karadzic is from the serb population of bosnia and herzegovina but he is the agent clearly of the next person stopped the largest migration of peoples in europe since the second world war over 2 million refugees homeless displaced children old people families slobodan milosevic is a name of infamy in the international community some of these people were named as suspected war criminals by thensecretary of state lawrence eagleburger almost a year ago but they are still free and in some instances we negotiate with them i only assert the guilt of these individuals because the new world order demands that we have a system of laws and not of men a system in which even milosevic has a right to defend his innocence the international community however needs to have him at the dock in the court responding to the charges as we did at nuremberg it is time to move forward with concrete indictment of specific individuals establish a framework for apprehending them and ultimately trials for war crimes i am convinced that a lasting resolution of the war in the balkans requires breaking the cycle of violence and vengeance that has racked this region not just in this century but in centuries past that goal can only be achieved through the administration of justice by an impartial and in this case international tribunal if we are to have a new world order it will be because as we become witnesses we then act as we become witnesses we become enraged and determined to hold accountable those who for no other reason than ethnic differences would commit acts of savagery on their fellow human beings inaction in the face of genocide is both immoral and illegal but here we are witnesses to yet another attempt in this century to annihilate a people while i do not believewe have done all we can to prevent genocide in bosnia neither do i believe that it is too late to act as i have said many times on this very floor and in letters to the administration the united states must take the lead in particular the united states should put the u n security council on notice that unless it acts within a specified period of time to lift the arms embargo against bosnia and herzegovina the united states will undertake unliteral action if necessary to uphold that countrys right to selfdefense a right theoretically guaranteed to bosnia by the united nations charter but denied to it in practice in fact what we and the rest of the world have done is to say we will neither defend you nor will we allow you to get the arms to defend yourselves how many of us would say to our neighbor under attack by those who would throw them from their home that we have arms available for them to repell the criminal element at their door but we will neither come to their aid nor will we allow them to purchase an arm to protect themselves that is not a moral policy that is not a policy that is defensible that is not a policy that allows any one of us to look at our neighbor the next morning and say we believed it was in the best interest of law and order in our community some time ago in the city of new york in a builtup neighborhood a cry was heard by many people it was a cry of rape by a woman named kitty genovese and she cried again asking for help from her neighbors and perhaps her friends but no one took a risk to open the door to open the door and go down the stairs to where kitty genovese was being attacked at least 50 people stayed in their homes later to admit hearing the cries for help and the cries of pain we hear of a genocide we hear of a genocide and we say to ourselves it is dangerous to go outside the door i do not advocate at this point in time the sending of american boys american men american personnel and material but at the very minimum i believe it a moral imperative that we give to those under attack the right the ability and the means to defend themselves for if we do not their blood is not only on the hands of slobodan milosevic and those criminal elements with whom he conspires if the international community rewards aggression and permits criminals to retain their gains with zero accountability then we shall have forged the contours of a new world order far worsethan the old if we permit war criminals to prevail by sheer force the postcold war era will be shaped by the voices of violence and vengeance if democracies are unwilling to back up their own principles with effective action then we betray not only the innocent victims of this war we betray ourselves and

the house floor over the course of the last 45 minutes or so because the committee on banking finance and urban affairs has not been allowed on the house floor to be able to make its case in terms of the alternatives that have been supported in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs to deal withs the very serious problem of insurance relining first and foremost i have heard members mention that we cannot go from zip code to census tract because of the cost the fact of the matter is that many of the insurance companies around the country already use the zip code 4 category which suffices to get the information that is required to make the determination it is very clear that you cannot make the determination as to whether or not redlining exists if you only take zip codes zip codes in many cities around the country involve urban areas that are in many cases very very poor that extend out to wealthy suburbs and therefore simply because an insurance company happens to write policies in a zip code does not tell you whether or not racial discrimination is taking place certainly you can get bipartisan support for such a bill because it does not do a darn thing if we are really interested in finding out whether or not racial discrimination exists in the insurance industry you have got to take it to a point where you are finding out whether the prejudice exists in terms of the cost the fact of the matter is the cost of these programs if you buy the cdrom is a very very inexpensive proposition in many cases first of all i should point out the banking industry already does this at the censustract level second the fact is that the information that we have gotten from both software companies at our committee hearings as well as from the industry itself indicate the cost to this industry will be minimal and it basically requires a computer programmer to punch a button on a computer screen to convert it from census tract to zip code i appreciate the fact that there is not a lot of racial discrimination in the state of north dakota and the fact is we had a member here who mentioned the fact that this was not something that he felt was particularly a big problem but north dakota does not have the same kind of problems that we have in boston or in philadelphia chicago or detroit or in places like los angeles where the problem of insurance redlining exists obviously there may be costs to straightening out an industry that has been racially prejudiced in terms of how it is writing its policies that might in fact mean some discomfort for the insurance industry in north dakota i am sorry for that discomfort the fact of the matter is the insurance commissioner in north dakota currently has changed since the gentleman from north dakota has left north dakota and now requires the information we are asking for in this bill so i am pointing out that if we are really interested in getting the kind of information that will allow us to make these determinations we need to have census tract versus zip code we need to ask for information on race and gender of course if you do not ask for information on race and gender certainly you get bipartisan support because it does not tell you anything if you want to find out whether or not it exists you have got to ask for information about race and gender if a minority or someone or a woman does not want to tell you or a man does not want to tell you their race or gender fine then they can exempt themselves from having to write the information but it allows us to ask the question if we are serious about getting to the point whether there is discrimination we need to have information on loss data the insurance industry is obviously going to tell us that the reason why they do not write policies is because the blacks are bad risks well my goodness let us at least find out whether the information we have gotten from the various insurance regulators who have come before our committee are telling us the truth when they tell us that in fact the minority community gets charged higher rates and has less losses i also would like to point out that in the amendment that the committee on banking finance and urban affairs is offering in order to deal with some of the paperwork burdens we exempt many of the small companies that does not exist in terms of the committee on

allow the fmc to adequately perform all of their statutory and regulatory responsibilities while the fmc is not well known outside of the ocean shipping community it does have a number of important functions including regulating the practices of ocean common carriers and other entities operating in the foreign and domestic offshore trades reviewing tariffs filed by ocean shippers licensing international ocean freight forwarders and issuing passenger vessel certificates of financial responsibility h r 1934 also includes a provision that would amend the passenger vessel certification act public law 88777 which insures that a passenger vessel owner has sufficient financial resources to reimburse passengers for nonperformance of a voyage this provision would modify the existing law to allow the fmc greater flexibility in determining the amount of a bond or other security that an operator must post in order to establish evidence of financial responsibility chairman hathaway requested this change in his recent testimony stating that the existing law which requires a passenger vessel owner to post a bond in an amount equal to the estimated total revenue for the transportation could be interpreted as requiring a dollarfordollar bond he believes existing law is more restrictive than necessary the merchant marine and fisheries committee concurred in that

inclusion of full reproductive health care services for women in any uniform national health benefits package that is mandated as part of health care reform all women should have the opportunity to make decisions about their owr reproductive health they must also have the ability to act on such decisions through access to the full range of reproductive health services including contraception prenatal care and abortion most private health insurance plans and health maintenance organizations currently cover abortion services as part of reproductive health care for women in fact over 78 million women now have insurance coverage for abortion services including members of congress their spouses and all federal workers under the federal employee haalth benefit plan we are not talking about adding a new health benefit for women we are continuing coverage o a health benefit that most women already have to eliminate any component of reproductive health care for women is discriminatory abortion is one of the most commonly performed and safest surgical procedures performed on women in this country according to insurance industry analysts unlike experimental drugs and new medical treatments abortion is a safe and proven procedure it is neither a social nor a political issue for the health insurance industry and it should stay that way increased access to safe and legal abortions has resulted in unquestioned health benefits for women exclusion of abortion from a uniform health benefits package will deny many women access to safe and legal abortion services only women who can afford to purchase services outside of the benefits package will have access to abortion services universal access to abortion services is one of the most controversial and emotional issues in the debate on health care reform regardless of our individual beliefs about abortion it is unconscionable that congress should impede any woman from making what is a difficult highly

who wished to be here to oppose this particular amendment but unfortunately is tied up at a hearing with the secretary of hud the reasons why this task force should be formed are probably the reasons why we should do more introspection in this institution as to how we spend money this really is a performance evaluation it is a study of whether or not the appalachian regional commission is performing the objectives and goals it was originally set up for whether the principles are applicable in other areas of the country how successful or how effective or how efficient it has been as a tool of the government in working in specifically defined economic areas of the country i would think as the chairman of the subcommittee on economic development has so eloquently said if we are spending 6 billion over 25 years it seems to me rather rational to spend 1 12 000th of that to make an evaluation as whether or not it has been as effective as it could be or how it could be changed or modified and remember that when the recommendations come in they will either come in to expand to contract to replicate and no action will be taken on the study except with the input of the members of this house and the full congress to determine what should be done if i had any recommendation i support the study and oppose this amendment because i think it is really what reinventing government is all about let us start seeing where we have made mistakes or what we have done well and when we find either make the appropriate corrections why do we want to stick our heaas in the ground and fail

influence votes or at least to try to stir action or to be a catalyst for action on the usda reorganization bill it influenced this member all right i really think that this action was unprecedented
