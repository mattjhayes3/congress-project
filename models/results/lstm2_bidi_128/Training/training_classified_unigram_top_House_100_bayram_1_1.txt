the gentleman from florida mr fascelli the chairman of the committee on foreign affairs as well as his ranking member the gentleman from michigan for their leadership in putting this resolution before the body i would also like to commend the two gentlemen from new york mr scuzuea and mr gilman for scheduling the special order that they have on this same important and timely subject we speak out today at an especially appropriate time fortythree years ago this month marks the end of a conflagration in which the majority of europes jewish population perished in the fiery furnaces of the nazi death camps the reason simply that they were jewish and thus marked for extermination by a perversely racist ideology to this day we remember the victims of the holocaust so as never again to allow such unspeakable atrocities to occur i say we meet at an appropriate time principally because we are presently concluding the days of remembrance7 days of national commemoration set aside to remember the holocaust yom hashoahquite literally the day of the catastrophe in hebrewwas marked in washington last week by a ceremony at the state department in israel they mark this day by setting off sirens for 2 minutes throughout the land in jerusalem in tel aviv ir haifa and in towns large and small israelis conic to a standstill in the streets cars pull to the side of the road and their drivers stand at attention as they remember the tragedy that befell their brethren in europe it is an unforgettable sight made even more poignant in that so many survivors of the death camps stateless after the war found refuge in what was then palestine it is said that there is tragedy in triumph and triumph in tragedy i can think of no greater example of the latter than the state of srael for the rebirth of the jewish state ct e in the aftermath of the attempt to anidhilate the jewish people and these suivivors of the holocaust became the foundation of that historic rebirth it is no coincidence that the days of remembrancewhich also include yom hazikaron a day of memory for israels war deadconclude with todays yom ilaatzmaut israels independence day as so often in jewish history grief and joy share the same stage president harry truman well inderstood the significance of the rebirth of the jewish state after all it was he who made the courageous decision in the face of unrelenting opposition from several of his closest advisers to be the first head of state to support and recognize the establishment of the state of israel this earned him in the words of david bengurion an immortal place in jewish history i have little doubt that the fundamental basis of united states support for israel and for strong united statesisrael relations stems from the very fact of israels rebirthafter 2 000 yearsas a member of the democratic family of nations americans identify with a sister democracy americans appreciate the common values shared by the peoples of the two countries and americans recognize the overwhelming odds which israel has overcome not only to survive but thrive israel reborn was a nation surrounded by those who vowed to destroy her at her birth and who with one notable exception have reiterated that view in word and deed for 40 years yet it is precisely because of the unremitting hostility israel has faced during its four decades that both its survival and subsequent achievements are so remarkable i can think of no other country which while surrounded by implacable enemies has maintained the standards of democracy and decency as has israel yes there are exceptions yes there are flaws which are inherent in any democratic society yes the pictures on the nightly news in 1988 are troubling sewing doubt and confusion in the minds of even israels stronger supporters and yet there are some fundamental facts which simply should not be forgotten israel is the refuge of jews from over 100 countries of all backgrounds and colorszionist pioneers holocaust survivors oriental jews fleeing arab persecution soviet and ethiopian jews and so many others who see israel truly as the promised land israel is home to upward of a half million moslem and christian arabs druze bahals circassians and other ethnic groups minorities living under full and vigorous protection of their democratic and religious rights israels most virulent criticsdespotic antidemocratic dictatorships which flagrantly violate the most fundamental human rights and commit abuses against their own peoplewould do well to follow israels example israel is a world leader in agriculture medical sciences the arts indusy education electronics and so many other fields israeli achievements in agricu t re especially are the reason israel was able to make the desert bloom and israel is not shy about sharing its technological knowhow with american farmers as well as with the people of nations across the globe indeed israels experiences with developing countries over the last two decades are supreme models of cooperation and success by all these remarks i do not mean to downplay another critically important dimension to the united statesisrael relationship the strategic ties between the two countries indeed congress has provided israel with substantial military and economic assistance over the years not as a giveaway but because we realize that aid to israel is an investment in the security of this country and of the west indeed the signing today of a memorandum of agreement between the united states and israel which formalizes israels status as a major nonnato ally and brings together all of the military and economic cooperative understandings of these last few years is recognition of the fundamental importance this countrythe administration congress and the american peopleplaces on the strategic relationship with israel i could go on and on about israels accomplishments over its short lifespan it is an exhilirating exciting wonderful incredible inspiring miraculous story the fulfillment of a 2 000 yearold dream to reestablish a jewish homeland it is a story full ofyestriumph and tragedy of which entebbe and maalot the 1967 war and

1, "i am pleased to join my colleagues in this special order to respond to charges made by some of our colleagues on the other side of this aisle regarding the way those of us in the majority have exercised our leadership during this congress in particular i am deeply disappointedand frankly perplexedby republican charges that too many commemorative resolutions are considered by the house as chairman of the subcommittee on census and population which has jurisdiction over resolutions designating commemorative periods it has always been my impression that the commemorative process represents one of the most bipartisan efforts we undertake in congress it is no secret that both democrats and republicans sponsor and cosponsor these resolutions and members from both parties eagerly request a few minutes on the floor to express their support of a commemorative in which they have a personal interest in fact the very nature of the commemorative process is bipartisan since the resolutions are brought up under unanimous consent obviously this is not an arbitrary exercise of the power of the majority in fact under unanimous consent it is the minority member who controls the floor time when commemoratives are considered if there is no objection on the floor to the resolutionand there is very opportunity to objectthen presumably every member of the house republican and democrat agree to passage of the bill and during my tenure as chairman in the 100th congress i have yet to have any member approach me to say they object to bringing commemoratives to the floor it seems to me that the republican leadership was so intent on finding fault with the majority leadership in the house that it decided to complain even about a legislative process which is clearly and unarguably bipartisan in both its approach and result the subcommittees distinguished ranking minority member mrs morelia and i have gone out of our way to accommodate both republican and democratic members who have sponsored these resolutions and to simplify the process as much as possible so that the maximum benefit is gained without placing an undue burden on any sponsors or cosponsors there may be faults with our current procedures for bringing commemorative resolutions to the floor but the democrats and republicans must take equal responsibility for any problems which exist it is simply ludicrous to suggest that democrats alone are to blame for the number of commemoratives considered by the house when members from both parties sponsor cosponsor and support these resolutions i should point out that proposals have been made to reform the commemorative process and i have not ignored them very recently the gentlelady from rhode island wrote to me regarding her legislation to establish a federal commission to consider commemorative designations i promptly wrote back on her legislation clearly democrats are not abusing any power they have as majority members to control the commemorative process to the detriment of minority members let me depart from my prepared text and cite another example the gentleman from pennsylvania a republican has introduced a piece of legislation to change the way in which the census bureau does its business the census bureau is opposed to the legislation tiie distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on constitutional rights the gentleman from california is opposed to the legislation the mexicanamerican legal defense and education fund is opposed to the legislation i am opposed to the legislation yet the gentleman from pennsylvania has been given not one hearing but he is going to get two hearings one in washington dc conducted by me and another one conducted by the chairman of the full committee on post office and civil service in the field the gentleman from pennsylvania will have ample opportunity despite the fact that we have serious constitutional problems about his bill to air his grievance let me also take a moment to address another point which i believe to be implicit in the criticism of commemorative resolutions the idea that the periods we choose to designate are not worthwhile columnist david s broder in his commentary on the republican challenge referred to commemorative resolutions as junk legislation and trivia but a closer look at the commemorative bills we have considered in the house during the 100th congress will reveal that the vast majority of these bills deal with topics of great concern to many of the people we are elected to represent and every resolution we consider is of interest to someone back home i for one have no qualms about spending a few minutes of my time each week as an elected official to honor former prisoners of war and women veterans visiting nurses and unitedstates inventors public employees and income tax assistance volunteers i see nothing wrong with recognizing the vast array of cultures which together make up the diverse society of which we are so proud the heritage of the jewish people greeks lithuanians germans polish americans and african americans i do not consider it a waste of my time to call more public attention to problems faced by the victims of crime to the importance of child care programs to the need for better health care in rural areas to the sad reality of child and elderly abuse to the environmental benefits of recycling and to the saving grace of hospice care for the terminally ill and no mr broder i certainly see nothing trivial in educating the public about diseases and serious health problems which often cannot be prope~ly dealt with due to a lack of public awareness a lack of adequate research funds or a general misconception about the nature of the illness not too long ago we knew little about the dangers of reyes syndrome lupus and high cholestorol levels the crippling nature of osteoporosis and tuberous sclerosis the availability of treatment for persons with eating disorders digestive diseases and tratuarelated symptoms it may be a little selfserving but i like to think that this nation has made great strides in medical care and promoting better health because of the many dedicated individuals including public officials who often volunteer their time to educate their communities about illnesses which may be rare but treatable or common but too often ignored no mr broder it is not a waste of my time to pass a simple resolution which calls attention to the alarmingly high and disproportionate rates of cancer among blacks hispanics and other minorities and to give some small measure of recognition to the tireless dedicated physicians who or ganized the first national symposium last year on minorities and cancer in an effort to reduce the incidence of cancer in minority communities that resolution which i sponsored prompted many local governments to pass similar resolutions and organize community sponsored events to pro mote improved awareness among nit norifles of the availability and nee lty of early treat miuint for cancer but equally tniaortent fromr my point of view lu that this resolimtviti passed by democrats and republicans in congress and signed by the presi dent said to a dedicated team of doctors that we are not ignoring their critical work and that we appreciate their efforts and sacrifices on behalf of their fellow human beings for the minimal amount of time it took for my colleagues to add their names as cosponsors of the resolution and the small amount of time it took for me to bring the resolution before the house it was the least we could do and hopefully only the beginning which leads me to my final point i get the impression that my repub lican colleagues believe the congress spends too much time on commemorative resolutions frankly i fail to see the problem here as subcommittee chairman it takes me no more than 10 to 15 minutes once a week if at all to bring the resolutilons up under unanimous consent after the business

the call for this legislation is clear the need is resounding i believe that a little background to this situation is required during the first half of 1980 approximately 125 000 cubans with the encouragement of our government migrated from cuba to the united states via the cuban port of mariel upon their arrival to this country the cubans received the status of conditional entrants because they lacked valid passports or visas as such they were technically excludable from the united states were entitled to no procedural rights under our laws and theoretically could have been deported at any time over the years the overwhelming majority of these mariel cubans were released into this country on parole status a small number however were never released and remained housed as detainees at the antiquated federal penitentiary in atlanta ga in addition some of the mariel cubans who were initially released were subsequently reincarcerated for allegedly committing crimes or parole violations in the united states initially cuba refused to accept the return of these or any other mariel cubans in 1984 however the united states and cuba entered into an agreement whereby cuba agreed to take back 2 746 mariel cubans who were currently being dotained in the united states the united states had returned 201 detainees to cuba pursuant to this agreement when allegedly in retaliation for the united states commencement of radio service on radio marti cuba abruptly terminated the agreement the united states continued to house mariel cuban detainees who had no realistic expectation of being returned to cuba or hope of being released into the community in november 1987 the united states and cuba reinstated the 1984 repatriation agreement and normalized immigration relations with cuba at that time there were approximately 3 830 mariel cubans serving prison sentences in state and local jails and 3 800 mariel cubans detainees in ins custody in state local and federal facilities though the inject due process into the review plan is agreement concentrated on the original list of that even as is the current plan affords the 2 746 all of the mariel cuban detainees were detainees greater legal rights than those to potentially eligible for deportation to cuba which they are legally entitled technically this the news of this agreement combined with argument is correct i do not

regime in the western pacific ocoan on october 20 1986 negotiators from the united states and 16 pacific island nations reached an agreement on a regional fisheries treaty on april 2nd of 1987 year the signing ceremony took place in port moresby papua new guinea and on june 19 the president transmitted the treaty to the senate after hearings on the treaty the senate voted 89 to 0 to consent to ratification on november 6 1987 the treaty will enter into force after ratification by the united states and 10 island nations the agreement requires that papua new guinea kiribati and the federated states of micronesia be among the states ratifying in order to bring the agreement into force over 14 nations have already signed the agreement and when the united states completes action on the treaty and the implementing legislation the treaty will go into effect the treaty combined with its annexes and related agreements contains three major initiatives first the treaty secures for unitedstates tuna vessels access to over 10 million acres of rich tuna fishing grounds within the exclusive economic zones and the high seas areas enclosed by those zones in the south pacific region to fish in these waters unitedstates tunaboat owners must purchase a regional license for the first year up to 40 licenses would be available at a base price of 50 000 each and the industry has guaranteed a minimum total payment of 1 75 million after 10 licenses have been issued 10 additional licenses would be sold at a price of 60 000 each in subsequent years the license fee would be indexed to the price of tuna but would not fair below the base price of 50 000 in addition the tuna industry has agreed to provide 250 000 annually in fisheries related technical assistance to the island nations through the south pacific forum fisheries agency after administrative costs are deducted revenues from the fees would be distributed to the island nations in proportion to the amount of tuna ta en from their waters the treaty also defines the procedures for regulating fishing activities and enforcing its provisions vessels fishing for tuna in the treaty area would be required to be licensed to carry observers and to abide by both the provisions of the treaty and applicable local law pacific island nations would retain the right to enforce regulations and prosecute violations while the united states would be expected to assist in the investigation of claims against unitedstates flag tuna vessels the united states would also ensure that violators submit to the jurisdiction of an involved pacific nation or leave the treaty area until penalties satisfactory to that nation are assessed and collected lastly associated with the treaty is an agreement between the unitedstates government and the south pacific forum fisheries agency guaranteeing 50 million in economic assistance to the south pacific nations over the 5year term of the treaty out of the 10 million in aid per year 9 million will be in the form of cash payments from the department of states economic support fund and 1 million in development projects proposed by the pacific island nations and approved by the agency for international development the bill at the desk is the senate companion to the house bill h r 3767 the subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment and the merchant marine and fisheries committee gave its approval to the house bill on december 15 1988 the committee filed its report on h r 3767 last week because of the need to move quickly on this issue

those provisions necessary to implement the licensing and regulatory provisions of the treaty and it does not contain any language or reference to the other development assistance package these matters are squarely within the jurisdiction of thre foreign affairs committee on which i serve and i expect that in due course that committee will provide appropriate scrutiny of the economic assistance agreement s 1989 assigns the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the treaty to tihe secretaries of commerce and state other key provisions of the implementing legislation include authorizing the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the treaty and the legislation including annual amounts of up to 350 000 for the department of

amendments act of 1988 and in support of this rule this bill represents an historic step forward for our nation by improving the protections that currently exist in the fair housing act and extending them to people with disabilities and to families with children i congratulate the members on both sides of the aisle who have worked to bring this bill to the floor in its present form especially the distinguished gentleman from california and i urge my colleagues to approve it without any weakening amendments amendments will be offered today to strike crucial protections in this bill the gentleman from florida is offering an amendment to strike the provision that prohibits housing discrimination against families with children under 18 accepting this amendment would be a critical mistake in a nationwide survey conducted by the department of housing and urban development it was found that 75 percent of renter units barred or restricted children from living in them in new york city and in other cities around the nation families make up an increas gly large percentage of the homeless many who can find homes often live in substandard housing in order to help alleviate this terrible problem american families must receive the protection provided in this bill i urge my colleagues to vote against the sht amendment and vote for protecting american families the second critical protection in this bill is for disabled persons presently individuals with disabilities are covered under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 this has been a critical source of protection for individ uals with handicaps yet unfortunately that legislation covers only entities that receive federal funds the legislation before us today represents an important step forward because it extends protection to people with disa vc s who experience discrimination in their elforts to obtain and maintain private housing this bill defines handicapped individuals consistent with the definition congress established 15 years ago in the rehabilitation act of 1973 under this definition a person is handicapped if he or she has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such persons major life activities has a record of such an impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment when congress first established this definition of handicap in the rehabilitation act it noted the importance of establishing such a broad definition in order to cover the breadth and diversity of people with disabilitiesand to cover the wide range of discriminatory aclions that are directed against people with disabilities the breadth of this definition has been reaffirmed by congress by agencies in administrative regulations and by the courts over the past 15 years examples of this emphasis can be found in the senate report accompanying the rehabilitation act see 1974 unitedstates code cong admin news 6373 638990 regulations issued by the department of health and human services see 45 c f r sec 84 3 and court cases such as southeastern community college v davia 442 unitedstates 397 405406 1979 and school board of nassau couny v arline 107 s ct 1123 1127 1981 we have specifically adopted that broad definition in this bill so that the same breadth and coverage of nondiscrimination protection will apply with regard to private housing this broad definition has been particularly important in protecting individuals who are often subject to the most irrational and virulent discrimination for example in our day and age people with aids and people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus hivcommony known as the aids virus are often subject to irrational discrimination in their attempts to obtain and maintain private housing in the arline decision the supreme court reaffirmed that contagious diseases fall within the definition of handicap in the rehabilitation actand that discrinination based on fear of the contagiousness associated with a disease is also covered thus any discriminatory action motivated because a person has aids or because of the fear of contagiousness associated with aids is covered under the definition of handicap in both the rehabiltation act and the act before us today in addition people infected with hiv are covered under both acts as i noted congross made clear in 1974 when it passed the rehabilitation act and we are making clear again todaythat the definition of handicap is made intentionally broad so as to cover the range of discriminatory actions thus for example individuals are covered who do not in fact have a physical or mental impariment but are perceived as having one or those whose physical or mental impairment substantialry limits their major activity solely because of the attitudes of others toward them the supreme court made this point very well in its recent decision in arline where it noted by amending the definition of handicapped indivldual to include not only those who are actually physically impaired but also thcse who are regarded as linpared and who as a result are substantially limited in a majur life activity congress acknowledged that societys accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical ulmitations that flow from actual impairment this is precisely the case with regard to individuals infected with hiv such individuals are covered under the definition of handicap because they are regarded as having a physical condition that substantially limits one or more of their major life activitiesand are thus subject to discrimination this is precisely the type of irrational discrimination motivated by fear and myth that congress sought to eradicate in the rehabilitation act of 1973 for programs and activities receiving federal funds and that congress seeks to eradicate today in the fair housing act amendmerts for private housing this is a congressional goal and effort that has boon recognized by the courts not only with regard to hiv infection see eg ray v school district of desoto county 666 f supp 1524 m d fla 1987 case dealing with three ray boys who were asymptomatic carriers of hiv but also with regard to individuals who suffer from other contagious infections see e g kohl v woodhaven learning center 672 f supp 1221 1224 w d mo 1987 case dealing with a hepatitis b carrier i would point out that people infected with hiv can also be covered under the first prong of the definition of handicap because they clearly have a physical condition affecting their hemic and lymphatic systems which affects a major life activity see e g thomas v atascadero unifed school district 662 f supp 376 379 c d cal 1987 individuals in all of the four cdc classifications suffer from impairments to their physical systems district 27 school board v board of educabor 130 mlsc 2d 398 502 n y s 2d 325 1986i this is a condition which substantially limits such individuals in activities such as working or obtaining housing or health care as well as limits them in the activity of reproduction an article in the journal of the american medical association 253 jama 363 june 1985 noted that 30 to 50 percent of children born to hivinfected mothers evelop aids and that hivinfected women who beacom pregnant are at increased risk of developling aids thus hivnfected individuals are advised to give serious consideration to deterring pregnancy in a recent case therefore both paetiesone of which was the department of justiceargued and the judge acceptedthat people infected with hiv are covered under the rehabilitation act either as individuals with physical impairments or as individuals regarded as having such impairments see loca t812 afgev unitedstates department of state 662 f supp 50 54 d d c 1987 i would like to point out that i believe thej judiciary committee acted prudently in adding a provision that states that nothing in the act requires a dwelling to be made available to an individual whose tenancy would cons itute a direct threat to the health or safety of others the committee noted that it was drawing on established cases and regulations that had been developed under section 504 including the supreme courts recent decision in school board of nassau county versus arline thus in the case of an individual with a contagious diseasesuch as aids or hiv infectionit would have to be proven that there was a significant risk that the individuals tenancy would result in the transmission of the infection to others in fact the current medical evidence is overwhelming that there is no such significant risk of transmission in the housing context nevertheless i believe it is useful to have added this provision to the extent that it can allay any unnecessary fears t rise in strong support of this legislation and urge my colleagues to pass it without any weakening amendments this bill will be looked upon as the foundation for further legislation protecting people with disabilities in the private sector"], [0.48252516984939575, 0.5174748301506042, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me i rise

interest as sponsor of the legislation to reauthorize the magnet schools i am especially pleased that h r 5 incorporates this popular and important program magnet schools spoci ize in different programs and draw students throughout desegregating school districts with an interest or aptitude in that subject as a result of this creative approach to education magnet schools bring together children from varying social economic and racial backgrounds it is the only federal program that combines desegregation efforts with academic excellence and i am proud to be the sponsor of legislation that continues the historical purpose and intent of magnet schools there has always been a heavy demand by local school districts for magnet school grants and i am pleased that the conferees were able to provide more funding for this program 165 million has been authorized for fiscal year 1989 and such sums thereafter the increased authorization level is more than double the current figure and reflects the great need throughout the united states for funds to facilitate desegregation within school districts i am grateful that conferees were so supportive of the original intent of magnet schools and provided additional funding for the continuation of this vital program h r 5 also incorporates legislation to reauthorize bilingual education in addition to simply extending this program h r 5 makes several changes that were in response to hearings and research on bilingual education moreover h r 5 authorizes 200 million for fiscal year 1989 and such sums thereafteran increase over current funding levels h r 5 recognizes that the number of limitedenglishproficient students has been expanding rapidly indeed demographic projections indicate that the lep student population will continue to grow 2 times as fast as the overall student population through the end of the century h r 5 reserves at least f30 percent of appropriations for bilingual education programs but also emphasizes the importance of instruction in the students native language by stipulating that 75 percent of this amount be directed toward traditional bilingual education the bill also encourages the use of developmental bilingual education a novel approach in which students with different language backgrounds learn from and teach one another their respective languages this method is an important one which may lead to both the acquisition of english and successful academic achievement by limitedenglishproficient students moreover h r 5 recognizes the importance of training teachers for bilingual education by reserving 25 percent of appropriations for this purpose i also take particular pleasure in the amendments to indian education programs included in title v of the conference report as a member of the committee who has had a decadelong commitment to meeting the educational needs of native americans i have had the lead role in crafting these provisions two provisions are of primary importance in the effort to obtain true selfdetermination the first is the prohibition in the bill against any unilateral transfer of bureau of indian affairs schools to thirdparty nontribal entities the second is a new authority to fund tribally controlled community schools under a grant authority which will provide more flexibility and local control than the current contract authority n passing the new grants authority the congress will be taking another historic step in its relationship with indian nations the policy provision in the grants authority specifically repudiates the outdated and failed policy of unilateral termination of treaties and the trust relationship between indian nations and the united states the policy of termination set forth in a house concurrent resolution in 1953 has been a dark shadow on our relationships with our indian constituents for the past 35 years today we admit the error of the past lift this cloud and move forward in reauthorizing the indian education act program the conference report has simplified the measure by reenacting the current disorganized set of authorities into a separate freestanding authorization i am also proud that the conference report addresses the problem of proof of eligibility for services briefly the problem of proof eligibility surfaced in 1985 when the department attempted to restrict the eligibility of indian students to participate in this program by limiting the acceptable proofs which the students parents could bring forward whether done for programmatic reasons or as an attempt to cut down the budget and justification for this program the effect was to cut the eligible population of students in half and to effectively terminate the programs for urban and nonreservationbased school districts note that this was not a matter of whether or not these students were eligible it was a matter of whether they could prove eligibility in fashioning a response the conferees have been greatly aided by the cooperation of the entire indian community basically the conferees agree that the form which was used in the 198586 school year to establish eligibility will continue to be the form used for this purpose the department shall continue to request specific information as set out on that form however the statute makes it clear that first other proof of eligibility shall be likewise considered and valid second the secretary shall establish no limitations of the proof to be considered and failure to fill out any parts of the form shall not be sufficient in and of itself to find a child ineligible and third the policies and practices in effect in academic year 198586 relating to sufficiency of proof of eligibility specifically including the rule on goodfaith compliance shall be used in reviewing the forms submitted nothing in the statute is meant to require submission to the department of all forms the conference report also calls upon the president to convene a white house conference on indian education such a national meeting is overdue i look forward eagerly to the discussion surrounding preparation for and actual participation in this national conference and anticipate recommendations from this body which will lead to substantial improvements"], [0.4827392101287842, 0.5172607898712158, 1, "i am delighted to rise in support of the conference report on h r 4867 the department of the interior appropriations bill before extolling the virtues of this measure let me extend my warmest thanks to chairman yates bill lowery and other members of the subcommittee and full committee who worked on the bill i have worked with them for 8 years now on the issue of offshore oil drilling and my appreciation for their work and their contributions to the protection of the coast is profound i will add as i have before that my constituents and literally millions of californians share my gratitude for their work this bill provides for a delay until october 1 1989 in the administrations proposal for oil and gas development off the northern california coast despite the fact that this area contains only a few days worth of oil and despite the fact that it is an environmentally sensitive area the administration proposed to go forward with a massive ocs development scheme this proposal ran into a little trouble along the way however the epa found that the draft eis on the lease sale was seriously deficient and the fish and wildlife service which ic part of the interior department concluded thatminerals management has inaccurately painted a picture of a routine operation with few potential impacts when in fact offshore development in northern california and the proposed tanker traffic is a high risk operation in rough seas in a geologically unstable area with potentially devastating impacts on coastal resources in response to this document the interior department pressured fish and wildlife to tone down its evaluation but even the sanitized document still contains sharp criticisms of the plan besides these concerns about the plan both vice president bush and governor dukakis indicated that they believed that the sale should be delayed or canceled to allow closer review of the environmental issues and the role of this area in the overall ocs program even secretary hodel agreed reluctantly to a brief administrative delay unlike the delay offered by secretary hodel however the delay provided in the bill will allow meaningful negotiations between the california congressional delegation and the department to take piace once the now ad september 8 1 988 ministration takes office this is critical to ensuring that a comprehensive resolution to this issue which includes all three california ocs planning areas can be developed i look forward to working with my colleagues and with the next president on this issue and i am deeply grateful to mr yates the subcommittee and the full committee for making that process possible by delaying lease sale 91 let me also touch on other key parts of this bill the bill includes a ban on prelease exploratory drilling in the areas which have received legislative delays in leasing this is critical to ensure that these sensitive areas are safeguarded from the impacts of this activity while longterm protections are developed in addition i am also grateful to bill lowery and sid yates for working to include language in the report accompanying the conference report which asks interior to report back to the committees on the need for an eis on seismic surveys this is an activity which has not been thoroughly studied and which has caused disruption in fishing operations and i would hope at a minimum that further environmental evaluation could be undertaken i am also pleased to note that the bill provides delays in leasing in florida and massachusetts these areas are critical and i would hope that the delegations from these states would be able to work with the next administration to provide longterm protections for them i am further pleased to note that the conferees were able to drop a provision in the senate bill which would have disrupted ongoing litigation in alaska over a lease sale in the bristol bay area this provision replaced a very illadvised measure in the bill as reported which would have advanced a lease sale in southern california and in fact waived environmental impact statement requirements for that sale while i was pleased that the southern california provisions was dropped there were serious concerns raised by the bristol bay provision and i am glad that it was removed frankly the bill represents the end of what has truly been an 8year war by the current administration against the california coast it has been a battle in which the administration has sought to impose massive oil and gas development in virtually every part of the coast even in the most sensitive areas it has also been a battle in which the administration shocked members of the delegation and millions of californians by reneging on an agreement which would have provided longterm protection for the coast and ended the guerrilla warfare on this issue i might add that the fight was conducted not only on the issue of offshore oil drilling but also on the issue of the states right to protect its own coastal zone and other related matters the battle is now over however and the administrations extremist policies have been defeated by voices of reason and balance from both sides of the aisle i am very hopeful that the next administration will take a better approach to this issue both candidates have indicated their sensitivity to the need to protect critical areas and i hope that this is a sign that we will be able to find a resolution tothls issue there is no question that millions of californians will press the candidates at every possible opportunity to make crystal clear their commitment to protection of the coast against illadvised ocs leasing proposals and other threats to this priceless resource i join them in hoping that the commitments which we have already received as well as others which we may receive during the course of the campaign are honored i urge my colleagues to support the conference report on h r 4867 i also urge the president to sign this measure into law and to bring the long battle over the administrations offshore oil drilling policies to a peaceful conclusion"], [0.48284053802490234, 0.5171594619750977, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume it is my pleasure to present to you today the fiscal year 1989 military construction and family housing appropriation bill the bill we are recommending amounts to 8 8 billion not included in this bill is a prior year appropriation of 214 million for fiscal year 1989 which when added to the bill amounts to approximately 9 billion the combined total which is used for seorckeeping purposes is 2 million under the presidents request and consistent with the spending limits set in the november 1987 budget summit for both budget authority and outlays some may argue that the bill is over last years level and may want to make reductions for that reason for the members i would like to put several things in perspective regarding this inmay 18 1 988 ti13360 crease first of all if you were to compare the 1989 level with the 1985 funding level you will find that military construction has experienced real negative growth of over 8 percent second during fiscal years 1986 1987 and 1988 significant reductions to the presidents request for military construction in the amount of 5 4 billion were made which is an 18percent reduction this has obviously caused a deferral of many projects which has impacted heavily on the departments ability to upgrade an aging military plant i would like to briefly speak to the departments revitalization and replacement program the military physical plant as it exists today is valued at about 600 billion and averages about 50 years in age the budget as presented is programmed for a 100year replacement schedule as opposed to the acceptable replacement rate of 50 years when you delay replacement of aging structures you create a maintenance and repair problem that costs more money in the end with regard to revitalization of an aging plant i would like to briefly outline for you how this bill should be considered as a wise investment there are many projects and programs in this bill that have pay offs in terms of direct and indirect savings that are not realized in this bill but in other parts of defense for programs which are under jurisdiction of the defense subcommittee for example every new housing unit funded in this bill reduces the housing allowance funded under the military personnel accounts every dilapidated facility replaced in this bill means a reduction in utility consumption and in maintenance and repair funded under the o m account every new maintenance or supply facility means a reduction in manpower costs funded under o m and military personnel appropriations every building that allows the department to move out of leased space means a reduction in annual lease payments funded under the o m account every new energy conservation project means a reduction in operating costs with over 60 percent of this bill being for revitalization projects you can see that this bill is a wise investment that not only provides for readiness but also generates offsetting savings the balance of the bill can be characterized as programs supporting quality of life in the military and projects necessary to house or support new equipment and expensive weapons systems at this point i would like to outline some of the main features of the bill one of the major problems affecting the military construction program in europe is the foreign currency situation as a result of the decline of the dollar there is a military construction shortfall of 300 to 400 million this year the administration refuses to request funds to take care of this problem but instead requests an increase for more overseas projects the committee recommends we appropriate 99 million for the dollar devaluation but offset the increase with reductions of 113 million on overseas projects since i have been chairman of this subcommittee we have been united in demanding that our allies share more of the burden of defense costs for programs in europe and in asia especially when our allies reap many economic benefits from our defense investments and commitments through the years this has been a difficult fight but we have had some success i am glad to finally see the president and secretary carlucci taking the initiative to negotiate for increased burdensharing with our allies likewise im glad to hear the presidental candidates talking about this important issue this bill once again addresses the burdensharing issue in real terms by cutting 25 million in programs that should be funded by our allies as a part of the burdensharing initiative this bill also prohibits the use of any military construction and family housing funds to effect the relocation of the 401st tactical wing from torrejon spain to another country we feel that this should be paid for by nato and or spain on the domestic side this is the third year of funding for strategic homeporting the committee is recommending funds in the amount of 173 million for funding at eight of the nine proposed homeporting sites about 78 million is provided for the initial beddown of the advanced technology bomber at whiteman air force base mo no funds are provided for the requested 31 million for the mx rail garrison facilities at f e warren air force base wy these funds were deferred without prejudice pending a decision of system deployment by the congress and by the next administration after several years of challenging the navys plan for relocation of a naval complex at naples italy the committee has agreed to initial funding for a relocation plan which will save over 100 million from the navys original plan for relocation as long as the national policy is to maintain an allvolunteer force quality of life projects such as new barracks housing and child care centers must be provided to keep the top performers in the service in this bill the committee is recommending 284 million for new housing construction of 3 200 new units plus funds for whole house renovation of existing units that are more than 30 years old this year the committee is taking the initiative to have the department formulate an installment purchase proposal for family housing as an alternative to the government committing itself to expensive leasing for the next 20 to 30 years the committee is also recommending 351 million for barracks to replace world war ii barracks even with this level of funding 245 000 men and women still remain in

forward to adjourning soon some of the boobirds are demanding a vote i have been there and needless to say we all miss our families my family is many hundreds of miles away and i miss them deeply and i am looking forward to seeing them soon to celebrate christmas i must also say that i am very proud as one member of congress to participate in this wonderful mosaic that is congress each one of us representing a district of 518 000 people all different kinds of people all different kinds of americans we are blessed and as we approach christmas in just a few days i think it is worthwhile to consider that we in fact are blessed with living in the greatest and most powerful democracy that has ever existed on the face of this planet with that blessing come certain responsibilities this wonderful mosaic of the unitedstates congresshas come together to agree on a plan for spending 600 billioh next year and within that plan are some things that some of us agree with and others of us disagree with i do not want to suggest that anyone who participated in the conference on this continuing resolution has any superior moral insight or is on a higher moral plateau than anyone else who participated in the conference but i would submit that just as my parents came to this country and had certain hopes and dreams for me and my brother parents all over the world have the same hopes and dreams for their children that someday they are going to havea better life than their parents were able to enjoy i think we come to this continuing resolution at a critical time when all of us everyone of us in this congress regardless of our political parties are hoping to see peace established we come to that question with different points of view and different views as to how that peace will be brought about i submit that within this process initiated by a learned man a student of history named president arias who has won the nobel peace prize he has attempted to bring about a process that will stop the killing in central america it is easy for us to sit here with the fruits of democracy going home for christmas with our families to perhaps avoid the fact that there is death taking place that there is a major military offensive being undertaken at this moment by the contras as they attempt to demonstrate that they are in a position to show power when i look at each of those nations and particularly the nations where most of the killing is taking place in nicaragua and in el salvador i would submit that not a great deal of progress has been made in either country the killing goes on in el salvador and in nicaragua on january 15 the presidents of the five central american nations who have taken a certain amount of pride in establishing a peace process are going to meet again it is a very tenuous peace process it has not really taken hold let us face that point it has not taken hold we hope it will take hold and we all i suppose have different views on how we can strengthen that process i hope that the process we take will be constructive rather than destructive president arias has made it clear that he thinks it would be a mistake to continue military assistance at this juncture to the contras there are many members here in this chamber who are convinced that it is necessary to maintain that commitment to the contras in order to put pressure on the sandinistas i wish that i could tell the members that i had some clearcut view on how to deal with this issue any more than anyone else in this chamber generally i tend to support those who have the same questions that i have rather than those who seem to feel that it is a black and white situation and that they have some kind of superior insight i must vote against this continuing resolution and i know many others in this chamber are going to vote against it because we believe that the avenue to an honorable peace in central america and the way to strengthen the tenuous initiative undertaken by president arias relies on our putting faith for the first time in our neighbors in not deciding that we as the unitedstates congress or we in the united states of america have a superior insight to the five central american presidents i sat opposite men of good faith in hour after hour of negotiations on this conference as it related to what kind of package we would provide for the contras and we are going to provide a package that does involve the transportation of lethal assistance to help them continue their military initiative that is taking place at this moment in central america it is my hope and i know it may very well be a vain hope that if we were to defeat this continuing resolution i and likeminded colleagues would not be in a position to go back and convince ted stevens and warren rudman or general powell or president reagan that we should fundamentally change the agreement we made on contra aid in this resolution but it would be my view that if this cr was defeated we might get a 30day temporary cr maybe a lot of members would not vote for it but it would be a cr that allows us to see whether that tenuous peace initiative could somehow be strengthened by the men and women of good faith in central america who are trying to make it stronger again at 1 42 this morning as we hope to adjourn and go to see our families i can only say as one member of congress as much as i would like to see my family after having visited central america as so many of us have the greatest christmas blessing i can think ofand i know i brought up the name of someone on this floor last year and was criticized for itin my view the greatest message that we could deliver on this night a few days before the birth of jesus christ is a message that says there is hope for peace in central america and that we are going to try to find an avenue that will allow that initiative to be strengthened that is the reason why i as one member of congress chose to take the position i did"],

oppose this legislation i can only hope the bills supporters will try to appreciate the sincere and serious reservations i continve to have about the approach they are advocating proponents argue that the latest bill is substantially different from the one the house previously considered the legislations supporters have made a serious effort to address some specific problems but in fact the bill is

prices and induced increases in prices of domestically produced textiles and apparel the cost amounts to some 100 000 per job saved in the direct production of textiles and apparel the net costs to

august 1977 congressman boland served as chairman until january 1985 and the standards he established for the conduct of the affairs for this committee should serve as a model for the future whether chairman boland was in agreement with the foreign policy objectives and intelligence operations of the carter administration or the reagan administration he conducted the affairs of the intelligence committee with due regard for the security of the secrets of the united states and with the goal of enhancing administrationcongressional cooperation and consultation in intelligence matters when chairman boland disagreed with the administration he fought it out fair and square as in the case of national policy in central america always however he was careful to advance his views in a manner which would not jeopardize the spirit of goodfaith cooperation and consultation between the congress and the administration and this spirit of good faith is essential if such cooperation and consultation is to continue into the future in my view chairman boland showed us the way and for this he deserves our commendation so as eddie boland approaches the end of his truly distinguished 36year congressional career i just want to say that i am one of his colleagues and from the other side of the aisle who comes forward to praise him for a job well done and to thank him for his help

married on august 9 1952 and i remember a happy reunion in russia when we were traveling with speaker albert on an official trip we sat down at a reception on august 9 and then realizing it was our wedding anniversary we had a party and eddie boland sang oh what a voice so we enjoyed it and so i salute the gentleman from massachusetts we wish him the best"], [0.5145788788795471,

that congress considers each year as ranking republican of the committee on education and labor i believe that this proposal gives appropriate recognition to the priority we as a nation must give to education training and social services the past few years have seen significant efforts on the part of state and local education agencies to revitalize our education system further these years have witnessed the implementation of a new job training program directed toward the needs of the disadvantaged and dislocated workers of this country i recognize that in all of these programs their basic strength resides in the fact that they are programs operated at the state and local levels however there is much that the federal government can and should do as a partner to assist these efforts as we look to our ability as a nation to compete in world markets and to maintain our standard of living it is critical that we have an educated and trained population in order to meet these challenges this bill is every bit as important to our competitiveness as h r 3 education and training programs have the capacity to help us hold our ground and to improve our competitive edgethey are vital to our economic survival our states local schools and colleges and universities have responded to the challenges that were first put forth to the nation in the 1983 report a nation at risk they have responded by requiring tougher high school graduation requirements improving textbooks and instructional materials increasing the time students are in class and reforming teacher preparation further we can point to greater business and corporate participation and support in improving our childrens education our education system has made great strides in providing services to a broad spectrum of individuals however the system has not been as successful in meeting the needs of those who are not in the mainstreamincluding the disadvantaged women and immigrants as we look to those who we will be depending on to fill our future workforce needs we are looking to exactly those who have historically fallen through the cracks we cannot allow such a situation to continue this appropriations bill comes a long way toward acknowledging that an investment in human resources is an investment in our future without an investment in education and training the alternative is illiteracy and unemployment and all the problems that stem from them for example 100 billion is lost each year in the gross national product due to the current numbers of illiterate and functionally illiterate adults in this country chapter 1 programs currently serve no more than 50 percent of the eligible population with the increase in funding provided in this bill in vermont as in other states these programs will be able to serve a greater number of disadvantaged young children whose education needs are now unserved the adult education program has assisted many adults achieve literacy this bill proposes funding consistent with the administrations request which will increase the programs ability to improve the literacy skills of many more adults who are suffering the isolation that illiteracy brings our vocational education programs have been called upon to provide the technical and occupational skills that will increasingly be needed for the future the funding proposed for vocational education in this bill will continue those efforts to meet the new skill demands of our evolving marketplace it is estimated that threefourths of the jobs available during the 1990s will require some postsecondary education federal funds must continue to provide access and opportunity for participation in postsecondary education for all americans not just those who are able to pay for it without assistance seventyfive percent of all student financial assistance is provided by the federal government h r 3058 continues this congressional commitment to educational opportunity funds srq also provided to assist colleges and universities in areas of important national needs for improvement in graduate and international education libraries and developing institutions one concern that we all have with respect to individuals having access to postsecondary education is the escalating costs of attendance in the higher education amendments of 1986 a provision was included which authorized a commission charged with developing a national policy which clearly defines the role and responsibility of the family institutions of postsecondary education the various levels of government and the student in planning for the financing of college the modest cost of this commission wilil be repaid back to the taxpayer as a result of its work unfortunately this bill does not contain funding for this commission and i intend to offer an amendment at the appropriate time to correct this oversight i am pleased that h r 3058 also contains funding increases for programs under the job training partnership act since 1982 when jtpa was enacted we have seen greater involvement of the private sector in the training of disadvantaged workers resulting in high placement rates in unsubsidized jobs the system is not without its problems but i am confident that as we continue to support its efforts they will be resolved it is unfortunate though that long deliberations over the trade bill have left us without new legislation for a much needed worker readjustment program i am hopeful that we will be able to work through the differences between the trade bills with respect to the worker readjustment program without that new authority increased funding for that program is not likely the program has been modified to include a rapid response capability and to provide a greater balance between quick placement and longer term education and training which many dislocated workers need we should not ignore the successes of the canadian ias model nor the information that we have from our current dislocated worker proqram under jtpa i believe that we have learned from these experiences and that the result will be a program better designed to meet the specific needs of our dislocated workers turning to another aspect of the bill while i understand the constraints under which the appropriations committee was operating i must say that i am somewhat disappointed in one respect the low income home energy assistance program received no increase over last years appropriation i think there may be the false impression among some of my colleagues that this program is somehow awash in money due to the oil overcharge funds this is just not the case in fact states are under no obligation to put this money into the liheap program and many have put very small amounts into it at the same time demands on the program are increasing this summers heat wave has strained the cooling programs and oil prices have moved back up very likely meaning higher heating bills next winter and these increased demands come at a time when the program has already been scaled back dramatically while the program covered 40 percent of all eligible families heating and cooling costs this year it will fall to less than half that amount in closing i want to thank both the chairman of the laborhhs subcommittee mr natcher and the ranking republican mr conte for bringing a bill to the house floor which appropriately reflects the priority that education and training programs must have in this country in order for us to maintain our competitive edge as a leader in the world market the fact that this bill is within the limits set out in the fiscal year 1988 budget resolution both in budget authority and outlays should be applauded i appreciate this opportunity to discuss but a few of the worthwhile programs in this bill and i strongly encourage my colleagues to support h r 3058 as it was reported out of the committee"], [0.5145480036735535, 0.5145480036735535, 0, "today i introduced

remedies should be available to persons who purchased dangerous atvs in the past and would like to return them i introduced the atv user safety and equity act to protect these atv owners this act requires atv manufacturers to offer refunds to all purchasers of threewheel atvs the legislation does not require anyone to return an atv that they want to keep nor does it ban possession of

to identify the owners of all unitedstates vessels i am pleased that we are moving towar1 enactment of the omnibus drug initiative act of 1988 this bill includes many valuable tools to improve the effectiveness for our efforts to stop illegal drug use the merchant marine and fisheries title of this bill contains provisions to aid the coast guard in interdicting illegal drugs including a section to facilitate drug interdiction on the great lakes i support prompt passage of these provisions since the late 1970s the merchant marine and fisheries committee of which i am the ranking minority member has received testimony on the need to quickly and accurately identify the owners of commercial and recreational vessels in this country a major benefit of this system is to aid law enforcement officers in tracking the identity of vessels much as they currently do with automobiles and airplanes literally thousands of vessels are stolen annually in this country yet there exists no effective way to identify the true owner of vessels or to return them to their rightful owners the faa currently maintains a system to identify owners of aircraft and the committee on public works and transportation has reported legislation contained in their title of this omnibus bill to strengthen that systems ability to identify the owners of aircraft we have learned that similar problems to those experienced with aircraft exist with vessels and in fact are complicated because of the ease of transferring vessel registrations from state to state without ownership certification this is a purely voluntary system for the states as i have found that states do not want the federal government imposing a mandatory requirement of this type on them however i also believe that participation will require minimum effort by the state participation in the system will mere y require most active boating states to network electronically with the secretary of transportation to supply information they already collect through titling or boating safety programs in this day of advanced computer technology there should be no reason why the government cannot handle this information with ease and efficiency as an added incentive for states to participate in this system this amendment would give mortgages or other financing on boats recorded in states the preferred status that commercial vessels enjoy under federal law accordingly thr amendment includes a codification of the >hip mortgage act recently ordered reported by the merchant marine and fisheries committee and contains procedures to support the preferred status for state recorded financing as such it is a necessary part of the overall vessel identification system the report of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries on h r 3105 will provide a more extensive legislative history the codification recognizes the prevalence of revolving credit loans in modern financing and allows their use in vessel financing it eliminates a number of useless formalities such as requiring that a mortgage be endorsed on a vessels document or the needless requirement that the coast guard be notified when a partial payment is made on a mortgage with respect to encouraging the financing of vessels the codification establishes a nationwide indexing system which will allow a preferred ship mortgage to be valid from the date of filing this will eliminate the current 8month wait before a mortgage actually grants the security interest important to consumers and banks while it will take some time to get this program operating i am convinced that the new system will be a vast improvement over current labor intensive and time consuming procedures in use today again modern computer technology can easily handle these tasks i want to commend several organizations which have worked so closely with the committee and have been such a help in the development of this codificationmost particularly the maritime law association the american bar association and the national marine bankers association the vessel identification system would be selfsupporting through a onetime charge of 1 per vessel and fees charged for data dissemination participating states would be allowed to keep half of the amount collected by them on vessels in their state to help defray expenses the balance would be paid over to the federal government for system maintenance with the gorwth of recreational boating in the united states the way it is this arrangement should finance the establishment of the system and then provide the means to maintain the system as new boats are recorded in the information system i am pleased to say that this system has many other applications besides drug law enforcement it would aid state and local law enforcement officials in recovering stolen boats permit state boating officials to check boat registration when they are moved from one jurisidiction to another allow financial institutions to protect their security interests in vesels aid insurers in tracking and recovering stolen boats and perhaps most of all provide consumers a reliable way to trace vessel ownership on boat purchases thus we will gain a costeffective multipurpose system rather than an inflexible singlepurpose one our committee on merchant marine and fisheries has had extensive hearings on both the ship mortgage act codification and drug enforcement in this congress in the past we have received testimony on vessel identification and ownership problems i recognize also that the administration and others have not yet had an opportunity to fully review this amendment under my amendment this system could be combined with other dot systems such as the aircraft registration system or contracted out to a private concern it is my position that if minor adjustments need to be made in the amendment i am open to that i intend to work with all interested parties in the house and senate as well as the states the administration and the maritime community to satisfy their concerns before this amendment is finally enacted i believe that if this amendment is not adopted once again the drug smuggler will by default have the upper hand in concealing his illegal activities and the maritime community will have lost a valuable opportunity for improvement for this reason lask my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule to allow me to offer this important amendment and for their support during consideration of the amendment itself"], [0.5126170516014099, 0.5126170516014099, 0, "i am here this evening to also participate in some sense in the recognition of the national day of excellence previous speakers have outlined dramatically as to why this day of excellence was created i would now like to focus the attention of the members on the solutions to our problems that we have had in the area of competitiveness and excellence i am pleased that the president in his state of the union address embraced a number of proposals to improve our competitive trade position specifically the president emphasized improvements in the math science education combatting problems of functional illiteracy federal support for worker retraining and relocation assistance and the need to enhance our research and development these are a few of the themes of a trade bill which i introduced last year parts of that bill that i introduced were put into h r 4800 which passed the house but as we all know did not get enacted into law i am particularly encouraged this year by the fact that we are not predominately talking about protectionism but we are turning our attention as the president did to the solutions to the problems of our competitiveness i am hopeful that this will lead as it already has been demonstrated by our meetings this afternoon with the speaker on how to devise bipartisan proposals to face some of the serious problems that we have in the trade area the think positive think export theme of this kind of competitiveness revitalization is the theme that america must have if we are to try to solve some of the problems i am here today to try to emphasize the need for these programs and at the same time to be realistic about how we can fund them it is one thing to talk about programs it is another thing to put them into fact and to be able to take these difficult situations that we face and find solutions to them that we can fund and we can make workable under the strict problems we have with the severe national deficit in order to do this it is important for us to find a system a mechanism of deriving the funds that will be necessary especially in the educational areas which will seem fair to america in my view it is only rational that those that benefit from the vast imports that we have by the lower cost should be the ones that should participate in finding the solutions to those problems it appears to me perfectly proper for those that benefit to be those the ones that would provide the funds necessary in order to solve the problems and not those that are suffering from the problems thus i am proposing and introduced as i did last year a competitiveness surcharge an ad valorem tax of not more than ninetenths of 1 percent on all dutiable imports this small surcharge will feed a trust fund dedicated specifically to fund programs to enhance our competitiveness this will not run us afoul of the gatt situations i am informed it will also raise a substantial amount of money in terms of somewhere between 3 billion and 4 billion per year what can we do with this as i outlined earlier there are a number of programs which need funding we need to retrain and to educate our displaced workers the administration secretary brock have proposed a program in this area and it is expensive it is some 900 million we should try to help and relieve the tremendous pressures on the pension benefit guaranty corporation and the funds there which are in dire need of help without putting more pressure on our employers who have survived to come forth to take care of the underfunded pension programs this is another area for those businesses which have been forced to go out of business and have heaped millions of dollars upon pbgc we ought to find a way to fund that also to support our math and science education programs most proposals have said well you know put a few million dollars in well the problem will not be solved with a few million dollars we have to fund it more toward its authorization level we have to use some sort of mechanism in funding to assist our schools tobe able to take full advantage of the modern technology available in the educational area now we have an opportunity in this country to take a leap forward in education if we take and utilize the many systems which are now available even starting as early as kindergarten we must support foreign language instructions in this country we cannot be a competitive government or a competitive force in the field of exporting if we can only speak english we cannot any longer take the position that because we are the dominant provider of goods that we need not learn how to be competitive in the sense of speaking languages of those that we desire to sell to adult literacy problems it has been pointed out very very articulately in the past few weeks in fact the past few years the serious problems we have with adult literacy if you have adult illiteracy you cannot have the proper skills needed in order for the people who suffer from those skill deficiencies to be able to take meaningful part in our society and in improving our competitiveness we need to assist in the formation of labormanagement committees to improve productivity we need to provide support for the upgrading of research and development facilities in our colleges and universities there are vast needs here congressman fuqua who is no longer with us had a bill in this past session i adopted parts of it which became part of the trade bill and in addition to that the white house studies have indicated a serious need here as well as hearings held by the northeast midwest coalition throughout the country we need to enhance the ability of graduate students to be able to attend graduate school without the huge loans now required to do that we must get the colleges and universities involved in improving the economic performance in the areas which they serve these are just a few of the programs which must have significant funding if we are able to solve the problems of our competitiveness the surcharge funds would be placed in a trust fund under my scheme earmarked for these and other programs specifically designed to improve our competitiveness and to handle our problems as a result of trade goods imported into this country should help fund positive steps to im prove our world trade position and help education and retrain american workers displaced by these very im ports it is only fair to have those creating our trade problems to pay for solving them the competitive surcharge would not violate our obligations under gatt and would not violate our trade laws it would not require cuts in other programs to finance these important proposals the question of whether we are serious about dealing with competitiveness depends upon our desire to fund these programs we can talk and we can talk but unless we come forward with funds we will not make any progress in these critical areas the global competition is a basic economic reality of our time a protectionist trade strategy may provide shortterm relief but will not help enhance the longterm economic position of the united states in world trade education is the key to our present and future work force to face this stiff global competition the average american worker is likely to hold five jobs in his or her lifetime and basic literacy skills are vital for american workers if they are to make these transitions with a minimum of destruction and displacement the national commission on jobs and small business a bipartisan group of 20 business and government leaders estimates that during the next 5 years virtually every community in america will have to replace 50 percent of its jobs and businesses the sheer number of workers affected in this niassive economic transition makes it imperative that worker retraining and placement be a priority of any efforts to address our trade problems our educational system can and must play a vital role in this national effort to prepare our work force for increasing global competition look at the massachusetts example ten years ago the states unemploy ment rate was the highest in the coun try as textile and leather goods industries went under today the states unemployment rate is among the nations lowest the states schools and universities were the base from which high tech entrepreneurs replaced every one of the 225 000 jobs swept away a decade ago in conclusion with a better educated more highly skilled workforce america can retain and reclaim its position as a leader in world trade although the programs i have mentioned are ambitious i want to emphasize that their cost will be borne not by additional tax dollars but from the proceeds of a competitive surcharge on dutiable imported goods those benefiting from our import problems should not be reluctant to pay for the solutions that are necessary to prevent those problems i think it is important for us to look not just at a political bill but one that will mean something as we go through this congress i hope that this method of funding will receive the serious consideration by the appropriate committees"], [0.5126161575317383, 0.5126161575317383, 0, "i want

this debate to remind not only our colleagues but the american people that we have no defense against ballistic missiles we defend ourselves against tanks we defend ourselves against submarines we defend ourselves against aircraft to a certain degree we do notwe do not repeatdefend ourselves against the threat ofa ballistic missile attack it seems to me in the context of this debate that we ought to remind ourselves that there have been several recent experiments in technology both exotic technology as well as very much proven offthe shelf technology of kineticenergy weapons that could be deplbyed in the near term i will be offering an amendment to direct the department of defense to initiate fullscale engineering and development of a firstphase strategic defense by 1993 i am aware that i will not win debate over my amendment but i want to send a very sharp signal to this administration that the question of whether or not to deploy sdi is not a technological debate it is a political debate and if there is to be a political debate there has to be someone to stand beside those men and women who understand the efficacy of a strategic defense technology and to tell this administration irrespective of what the left wing wants in europe and in the united states that we believe that it is morally imperative politically practical technologically feasible and fiscally responsible for us to move to deploy offtheshelt kineticenergy weapons i a point defense in an ex atmosphere defense andih the boostmay 1 2 1 987 9 314 8 phase defense of the united states of america i want to remind my colleagues on the democratic side of the aisle that president kennedy in 1962 did not stand up before the american people and say we are going to research and test to see whether or not we might be able to put a man on the moon he did not say that at all he said we are going to go to the moon i do not know if he knew that we could do it i believe in my heart that he believed we could there were a number of scientists who questioned whether it should be done but president kennedy made the political decision and wernher von braun and the distinguished scientific community cooperated in achieving one of the greatest accomplishments of modem history if you think going to the moon is important it is at least equally important and i would agree more important to defend our families our children our allies and to begin to develop a technology that is peaceful that is positive and will prevent war both in space and on earth and it is irresponsible for the left wing critics of sdi to call sdi star wars sdi is not star wars it is designed to prevent war its purpose is to prevent war and i think that is a moral imperative would sdi be a perfect shield no can it disrupt the soviet planners yes and i would hope that you would vote in favor of forcing this administration to move to an ioc date of 1993 for the development and deployment of strategic defense"]],

colleagues the remarkable heroism of this man during world war i1 general mihailovich was truly a hero with a very special tie to our country not only was he a leader of his countrys resistance to the nazi occupation but also to 500 unitedstates airmen fighting in europe he was a savior general mihailovich spearheaded an operation designed to rescue american airmen who had been shot down in yugoslavia behind the nazi lines this operation sheltered and cared for at least 500 of our countrymen until they were rescued there is no question that he in fact was directly responsible for their lives being saved some of the individuals who were saved have family ties in my district in 1948 president harry s truman posthumously awarded the legion of merit to general mihailovich in recognition of his heroism his sacrifice and his unwaivering dedication to freedom and in gratitude for his help to the hundreds of unitedstates airmen saved through his rescue operation as the president said at that time general mihailovich contributed materially to the allied cause and was instrumental to final victory in addition to this official recognition of his contribution to our country and to the cause of freedom the men who were rescued by the general formed an organizationthe national committee of american airmen rescued by general mihailovichto pay tribute to the man who saved their lives

years since i traveled to south africa and witnessed with my own eyes the utter horror of apartheid i saw racism at its worst an institutionalized economic and political supremacy of white afrikaners over blacks and coloreds and indians the africkaners were patronizing and they rationalized the existence of apartheid as something for the good of the blacks in south africa i became outraged at such blatant disregard for the lives of their fellow human beings and the anger that i felt then has not diminished over the years i am angry today i am angry because south africa has not changed i am angry because the nations of the west have not made a concerted effort to pressure south africa to end apartheid i am angry because south africa has met our overtures of concern with outright rejection and has circled the wagons in response to our small actions to pressure them to change i am angry because south africa has not listened to the voices of its own people the cry of distress the cry of anguish the cry for justice the cry for freedom we must not allow ourselves to turn a deaf ear on the cries we listen to them even while south africa ignores them we respond as we did 2 years ago with economic sanctions only this time the sanctions are going to be more than a minor irritation to south africa they are doing to sting south africa will not be able to ignore the sting the sanctions require complete disinvestment from south africa they are tough uncompromising measures that are meant to have an impact and believe me they will economic pressure is the best most legitimate lever we have to move south africa it is a long lever and i hope it will be long enough the bill mandates that the president seek multilateral economic action against apartheid and i know

rise in support of this amendment to try to cut it out across the board one reason i decided to speak here is because i am little concerned about some of the funny money accounting procedures that we have had discussed here on the floor in the last few minutes as i understand what we keep hearing is that these cuts are going to massively undercut programs let us understand what we mean by cuts in the context that we are talking about if we were to apply a family standard to this bill what we are really saying is that if you are a 20 000ayear family and we come to you with a 3 2percent cut what you probably assume is that we are going to cut your standard of living by 640 now for the average 20 000ayear family that is a fairly significant cut now 640 out of their annual budget would in fact cause them to have to make some adjustments and it would be a serious thing for them to have to meet but that is not what we are saying here what we are saying here is that you do not have to take a 640 cut with this 3 2percent cut no instead what we are going to do is we are going to raise the base on which we make the cut to 21 000 a year so that the 3 2percent cut is one of 672 but mind you that is from 21 000 so what this cut really means is that you will be getting next year about a 328 increase over what you got this year well most families would say hey i can probably live with that that is not a cut that is an increase it may not be as much as i would like but it is in fact an increase it is 318 more to spend next year than i got this year that is exactly what we are doing here we are in fact increasing the amount of money that these programs get we are increasing it by a fairly significant amount of money and we are doing so in a way that allows us to meet the needs of the nation all that is being suggested in this particular amendment is that we are going to cut that increase 3 2 percent now i would suggest that we can probably afford to do that and i would hope we

faster track than ever this year i am confident that we have brought a quality piece of legislation to the floor of the houseone that minimallyand i emphasize minimallyprovides our armed forces with the wherewithal to adequately man equip and train against the threats we and our allies face in the world h r 1748 would make numerous changes as well as approve many items contained in the presidents defense request i am certainly not in agreement with all the changes but i find myself supporting the vast majority of the bills provisions as some of my colleagues have already noted h r 1748 contains 305 8 billion in budget authority a reduction of 6 2 billion or 2 percent from the presidents 312 billion request the committee approved real growth in defense budget authority of about 1 percenta bare bones increase as far as i am concerned especially following 2 straight years of real decline in the interest of time i will confine my remarks to two subject areas that i believe to be particularly importantseapower issues and military personnel and compensation i serve on both of the relevant subcommittees and wish to commend the members of these panels for their fine work on behalf of the nations defense program with regard to seapower issues h r 1748 would reduce the administrations shipbuilding request by 164 million although the committee recommended denying authority in fiscal year 1988 for 3 mine countermeasures ships the committee approved 13 new shipsas compared to 16 requestedand 4 conversions within these overall totals i am especially pleased to report that h r 1748 contains the authorization for replacementand i do emphasize replacementof two aircraft carriers in the 1990s the bill authorizes long lead funding to replace the unitedstatess midway in the mid1990s at a point when it will be 52 years old and to later in the 1990s replace an aged forrestal class carrier the carrier proposal is crafted to preserve our shipbuilding mobilization base and to save up to 16 000 jobs and will save at least 700 million over any other replacement strategy this authority is vitally important now failure to provide it would scuttle the navys ability to maintain 15 deployable carriers make deploying larger numbers of modern aircraft more difficult and result in higher operating and support costs for the ships themselves i certainly hope that the house will reject any amendment designed to delete these carriers from the bill another area of interest is attack submarines the committee approved the administrations request for three ssn688 attack submarines as well as authority for advance procurement for the lead ship of the ssn21 or seawolf class i would emphasize to my colleagues that the ssn21 represents our best counter to the everimproving soviet submarine capability leaving seapower and turning to personnel h r 1748 contains many excellent provisions designed to increase the numbers of men and women in the armed forces provides modest compensation improvements and improves the military medical care system as ranking member of the military personnel and compensation subcommittee i can tell you that we grappled with many important issues including the pay raise medical care and officer reductions and i agree with most of the positions adopted by the committee for example the committee provided the full end strength request for all active and reserve componentsan action i view as critical for keeping our manpower levels in sync with operational readiness i take exception with the committees position on the pay raise however it was and is my belief that our troops rightfully deserve a 4percent raise as proposed by the president i fear that the 3percent raise approved by the committee is penny wise and pound foolish and i hope that we can provide a more adequate pay raise during conference with the other body on this bill ill conclude my remarks here by congratulating all committee members for a job well done and by especially thanking the chairman of the military personnel and compensation subcommittee beverly byon and chairman bernztr of the seapower and strategic material subcommittee for their leadership in

"mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me the first part of h r 5115 before us today simply extends the program established in the 1986 immigration reform and control act which allows additional nonpreference immigrant visas to aliens from countries adversely affected by the repeal of the national origins quota system in 1965 no special requirements are attached to these visas other than that the individual comes from a country that has experienced a reduction in its permanent immigration into the united states in recent years since 1965 when family reunification became the principle basis for admission those wishing to immigrate from traditional source countries of western europe such as italy germany or ireland have found their access tu the united states severely reduced this legislation addresses this problem by providing additional visas for such underrepresented countries earlier this year the senate passed comprehensive legislation on legal immigration known as the kennedysimpson bill in addition the chairman of the house judiciary committee chairman rodino and of the immigration subcommittee chairman mazzoli introduced legislation on this issue although the house judiciary subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law held hearings on these bills in september there was simply not enough time to deal with comprehensive legislation on this topic therefore the bill before us is a temporary solution until congress can pass more comprehensive legislation revising our legal immigration laws that balance ethnic diversity and economic needs as well as our traditional commitments to family reunification and admission of refugees i would like to compliment senator simpson and senator kennedy as well as congressman rodino and congressman mazzoli for their dedicated work on legal immigration reform legislation this year i look forward to continuing our work on this issue in the next congress h r 5115 also contains the schumerfish proposal which provides for an extension of certain h1 immigration visas for nurses whose visa expires in 1988 or 1989 this extension would also be available for those nurses whose legal status expired in 1987 but who have filed an appeal for the extension of such status prior to the date of enactment of this bill as my colleagues know currently the united states is facing an extraordinary nursing shortage although the exact size of such shortage is unknown approximately 200 000 nurses positions are unfilled in our hospitals and nursing homes across the nation while our health care systems nursing schools and professional nurses organizations are working to find solutions to this crisis our health care facilities have found it necessary to recruit skilled medical personnel and nurses from abroad today thousands of foreign nurses are employed throughout the nation and are providi 9689 ing needed professional litalth care services for our citizens many community hospitals throughout this country have suffered substantial disruption in their delivery of health care services some have had to close beds and even whole floors because of the large shortage of qualified nurses to provide nursing services in my own district approximately 160 foreign nurses have been recruited and are working in area hospitals10 percent of that number being in the inmediate risk loss category due to the expiring hi visas on may 26 of this year the immigration and naturalization service aware of the critical shortage problem announced that all foreign nurses now in the united states on iii visas and whose visas had expired or would expire in calendar year 1988 would be granted an additional year in the united states thus allowing them to stay for a total of 6 years in addition ins directors were give the discretion to grant additional timeafter 19088for foreign nurses on a casebycase bas is this new immigration policy was certainly welcomed by nurses hospitals nursing homes and other health care facilities while longterm solutions are explored the uncertainty of discretionary iecisions would continue however for the nurses at risk during 1989 and an unnecessary burden placed on hospitals when the crisis needs no proof the bill before us today therefore is a blanket extension of h1 visas for an additional year ending december 1989 this will provide some shortterm relief and enable the health care professions administrative agencies interest groups as well as congress to further examine both long and shortterm solutions to this critical problem i would like to thank chairman rodino and chairman mazzoli for bringing this legislation before the committee expeditiously i would also like to compliment congressman schumer and his staff
