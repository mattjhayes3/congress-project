lifetime domestic violence dating violence sexual assault and stalking lead to severe social health and economic consequences for our communities with the estimated cost of violence exceeding 70 billion dollars each year historically each time vawa has come up for reauthorization congress has added beneficial provisions to the bill and passed it with strong bipartisan support in 2005 we included language referencing culturally and linguistically specific services to help eliminate barriers for many racial and ethnic minorities my colleagues and i also successfully included a new health title in the last vawa reauthorization that strengthened our health care systems capacity to prevent violence and develop effective interventions to abuse the version of vawa before us today threatens to roll back those gains and limit protections for victims ultimately endangering their safety in lifethreatening ways h r 4970 omits provisions in the senatepassed bill that ensure equal treatment and access to services for lgbt survivors it denies justice for tribal women abused by nonindians negating the reality that native american women suffer domestic violence at epidemic proportions but remain largely unprotected under current law it also jeopardizes the personal security of victims who rely on public housing by forcing some to choose between swiftly moving away from an abuser and losing their housing subsidy equally egregious h r 4970 eradicates protections that have benefited immigrant women for nearly 20 years the legislation creates barriers for immigrant crime victims seeking uvisas and silences those who fear deportation h r 4970 overturns the current ability of immigrant victims of domestic violence to confidentially selfpetition for permanent residency thereby returning power to abusive unitedstates citizen and legal permanent resident spouses who wield their status as a tool of dominance and control since vawas inception in 1994 nearly 75 000 selfpetitions have been approved for immigrant victims who would have otherwise remained dependent on an abusive spouse to adjust their status we cannot reverse course on this important selfpetition provision and turn our backs on immigrant women and families i am also disappointed that yet again provisions to alleviate the economic factors that keep victims in abusive relationships

benefits to victims forced to leave their jobs due to circumstances stemming from domestic violence allows victims to take unpaid leave to make court appearances and seek necessary assistance and it prohibits employers or insurance providers from basing hiring or coverage on an individuals history of abuse these provisions ensure that domestic violence survivors have the financial security they need to escape an abusive situation failing to address these economic concerns is just another way this legislation fails to adequately protect survivors of domestic violence its unfortunate that

issue by the committee va claimed that the program was fine and did not need any statutory changes this bill will help weed out those bad actors and implement the necessary oversight actions va has failed to take while simplifying the confusing and burdensome requirements of those beneficiaries performing their jobs well on behalf of those veterans the va fiduciary program is intended to administer benefits for veterans deemed incompetent to handle their own finances by the department of veteran affairs fiduciary program numerous deficiencies within the program have been highlighted by the veterans affairs committee and brought to the vas attention yet the department is continually slow to act and fix these systemic problems among those problems are fiduciaries that are embezzling veterans funds refusing to pay a veterans utility bills fiduciaries taking more than the amount authorized by law as commission for services rendered convicted felons appointed as fiduciaries and fiduciaries telling veterans to conserve money by not running their air conditioning during the summer months despite these tragic stories va maintains that its fiduciary program is in fact sound an argument difficult to justify when earlier this month a couple pleaded guilty to stealing over 2 million from 49 veterans i hate to tell you that this is not an isolated case at the beginning of 2012 a unitedstates district judge sentenced two vaappointed fiduciaries to prison for stealing nearly 900 000 from 10 different veterans in both cases the fiduciaries used the stolen funds to go gambling among other things the veterans fiduciary reform and noble service act makes muchneeded improvements to vas fiduciary program by allowing veterans to appeal the appointment of a fiduciary allowing a veteran to request that a new fiduciary be appointed when cause can be shown and to designate a preferred fiduciary ahead of time such as a family member the bill would also remove the profit motive for predatory fiduciaries by reducing the commission thats paid to them to a level in line with social securitys program thats equivalent fiduciaries would have to undergo

another lapse in oversight the va has failed to address section 3 of the legislation designates a place of remembrance at arlington national cemetery to serve as a dignified final resting place for remains of veterans that may not otherwise have a final resting place this section is in direct response to our learning last year that cremated remains were being taken from dover air force base to a landfill a practice that took place over a 4year period sections 4 5 and 6 aim to address an incident that happened at the bushnell national cemetery where a veteran with no known next of kin was buried in a cardboard box section 4 requires the secretary of veterans affairs to furnish an appropriate casket or urn for a deceased veteran with no known next of kin where no other person claims the body and the veteran lacks sufficient resources to cover burial and funeral expenses section 5 improves the communication between the va and funeral directors and the medical examiners office by requiring the secretary to ensure that any entity transporting the body of a deceased veteran to a national cemetery submits to va whether the deceased veteran was cremated and whether or not steps were taken to ensure the deceased veteran has no next of kin section 6 requires the secretary to submit to both the house and senate committees on veterans affairs a report within 180 days of enactment of this legislation detailing vas compliance with industry standards for caskets and urns including a description of the industry standards for caskets and urns and an assessment of compliance at the national cemeteries that are currently being administered by va section 7 of h r 5948 as amended would bar convicted tier 3 sex offenders sentenced to a minimum of life in prison from burial in national veterans cemeteries and some state veterans cemeteries currently those convicted of capital crimes are prohibited from such burial and this will prohibit people convicted of an equally heinous crime from tarnishing the honor of veterans cemeteries section 8 ensures that the explicit wishes of a veterans family with regard to religious expressions are honored during interment or inurnment ceremonies at a va national cemetery last year officials at the houston national cemetery were accused of restricting religious speech at a ceremony while that specific incident was resolved in the courts this section provides a legislative safeguard for all national cemeteries section 9 would allow county veterans service officers and some congressional employees access to readonly information regarding the status of a veterans claim during a roundtable discussion between the committee and county veterans service officers one of the main obstacles highlighted to answering veterans questions was the lack of access to claims file information facilitating this additional level of assistance in the claims process is one simple step we can take to help veterans and potentially address the growing claims backlog section 10 as amended will improve protections to veterans whose sensitive information has been compromised by the va now veterans may not know right now that their personal information has been compromised for well over a month after it has occurred but in this time of predatory identity theft thats far too long and much damage could have taken

apply to more projects by making waivers from these local requirements much more difficult that means that few transportation projects can be undertaken to fix our aging infrastructure this is not the time to impede strategic investment in american infrastructure which holds the key to unitedstates economic competitiveness and prosperity second a misplaced requirement to buy local would hurt american companies undermine their competitiveness hamper their innovation and productivity and prevent them from participating in bidding for transportation projects due to their increasingly global supply and production chains as we all know many products that american companies build will sometimes have parts from other parts of the world mainly so they can compete against other products in the world take for example a store from back home in texas where a canadian manufacturer of pvc pipes and fittings was advised by its distributor in california that the contractor who had used its fittings on sewage pipes installed at camp pendleton was being asked to remove the fittings from the ground and replace them with a similar product from an american competitor so far it sounds good the problem is the canadian manufacturer purchased most of its plastic resin inputs to make those fittings from texasbased companiesfrom american companies in texas that meant that buy american restrictions prevented our local companies from being able to export their product to canada and sell it as part of an overall project in california it was an overall loselose situation for everybody in short more stringent buy american provisions actually make it harder to sell american because of the realities of how products are built these days these provisions will prevent american companies from being able to sell inputstheir productsto foreign companies who then go after government contracts it may sound attractive to cut foreign companies out of the procurement market but dont forget about the thousands of american companies and millions of american workers who stand behind them and depend on them third tightening buy american restrictions also sends a message to our global competitors that its all right for them to enact more barriers against american goods and services when theyre selling and buying procurement in their home market in fact all over the worldin countries like china india and brazillocalcontent rules in a variety of industries are popping up to block american companies from selling into there in justifying those restrictions against our american companies these countries often point to buy american provisions and argue that what theyre doing is just the same well this dynamic has the effect of stopping american businesses and their workers from competing in vast foreign procurement markets around the world resulting in billions of dollars lost to america and to our opportunities to sell our products overseas fourth such measures also make the united states a less attractive market for foreignbased companies that employ millions of hardworking americans here at home expanded domestic content requirements send precisely the wrong signal as america seeks to reverse the trend of declining foreign investment into america which creates products and companies and jobs here in america and fifth tightening the buy american restrictions could also leave the united states vulnerable to world trade organization litigation and retaliation based on what our obligations are under the wto government procurement agreement overall stricter buy american provisions undermine the american governments ability to buy the highest quality goods and services at the lowest cost to us the american taxpayers it makes it more difficult to maintain policies consistent with our obligations around the world and it blocks our ability to show our trading partners they need to open their procurement markets to american goods and services and at the same time they hurt unitedstates companies that are trying to find customers for their products and services i understand how politically appealing these measures can be but when they backfire against american companies when they backfire against american workers you dont read much about it but it costs these workers their livelihood frankly it takes american companies competing here at home and around the world out of the picture at a time when we have a struggling economy after the stimulus after all the bailouts after all the cash for clunkers deficit spending we actually have fewer americans working today than when the president took office now is not the time to hurt more american workers drive up the cost of these projects delay them further and ultimately hurt our ability to compete and sell around the world no matter how politically appealing this makes no economic sense for america for all these reasons i urge my colleagues to vote no on this

people and for me thats 100 families i have to make sure that i can ensure that we can provide health care insurance and other benefits before it is time to hire new workers there are 29 million small businesses in our nation here in this body i believe our goal has to be to create an environment that enables those small businesses to have the confidence to be able to grow and thrive to be able to add that one new worker and think about where we would be at that point in time 29 million businesses across the nation all hiring just one worker wed have a different problem on our hands the partisan rhetoric and the lack of progress in washington is hindering businesses from hiring more people but i do believe we can come together and tackle some of these problems washington has to stop viewing legislation through a political lens and start viewing it through the eyes of the american people one area we can agree on is the payroll tax extension the house voted at the end of the year to extend it for an additional year the president has asked that we extend it for a year the holdup is yet again in the united states senate senator harry reid would rather play political games with this important measure and now some members are asking for a 2month extension i say enough is enough we need to extend this tax holiday for the entire year small businesses dont have the luxury of hoping that well get it right so lets come together today and pass the yearlong extension in both the house and the senate lets give hardworking american taxpayers the relief that they need new regulations are also hindering small businesses from expanding hundreds of pages of new regulations in the presidents health care law hundreds of rules that have still yet to be written in financial services with regard to doddfrank are hindering the financial services industry small businesses do not know what new rules are coming next and thus they cant prepare for the future and job growth remains at best uncertain but we can and must find common ground on regulations no one is arguing for the elimination of regulation what we need is smart regulations its vitally important we have clean water safe working environments and rules to protect families investments even the president has called for smarter regulations and repealing burdensome regulations that are around this nation we can repeal burdensome regulations that are nothing more than red tape and barriers for job creators we can replace them with smart regulations that truly make our country better and give job creators the certainty they need to grow and thrive finally we must stop the enormous deficit spending thats going on right here in washington dc this next year were faced with another trillion dollar deficit if my business my small business back in illinois ran the way the government runs id be out of business inside of the month its time we in washington rein in this outofcontrol spending we cannot ask hardworking american families all across the country to live within their means but then turned around and allow washington to take their hardearned money and spend it without regard to the future consequences of our children and grandchildren its time we pass a budget that puts our country on a viable economic path forward when we do this it will signal to the rest of the world that we are serious about our economic health and thus well be able to empower job creators to invest here at home and create jobs right here in our local communities i am optimistic about the future im optimistic that we can do this that we can come together spurring our economy and talking about growth isnt a republican idea or a democratic idea but it is certainly an american idea its time that we
