well aware of the seemingly reasonable arguments in support of foreign aid it is said that december 1981 the united states has a moral commitment to help those in the world suffering from the ravages of famine or drought that the united states acts in its own security interests by aidingeconomically or militarilycertain countries that the united states promotes international economic stability by providing economic assistance to developing countries these are al laudable goals unfortunately these omnibus foreign aid bills rarely implement them and often hinder them a vote against the foreign aid bill is not a vote against mercy i do not think there is one person here who is against the alleviation of innocent human suffering in september 1979 shortly after the caribbean was hit by a terrific hurricane i joined a majority of my colleagues in voting to send 25 million in disaster relief to those countries affected several weeks later i again joined the majority of this house in passing a bill to provide over 200 million that year for the feeding and care of indochinese refugees that bill also provided 30 million to help feed those victimized by the twin evils of famine and vicious totalitarian rule in cambodia the u s congress does not turn its back on starving babies unfortunately the foreign aid bill does not always feed starving babies i submit for the record a column by jack anderson while i do not always agree with this columnist i think that this article provides an excellent example of the faulty approach implicit in foreign aid in bangladesh unitedstates food goas to the wealthy in the 10 years since bangladesh became a nation its hungry people have received more than 1 5 billion in american aid theres just one problem the unitedstates aid money is enriching the wealthy while the poor continue to starve life has always been harsh on that pathetic piece of earth called bangladesh it is a flat almost marshy plain bedeviled by op pressive humidity monsoon rains and cyclones the rains that enrich the fields also support an ideal environment for cholera smallpox tuberculosis and malaria if the death rate is appallingly high the human birth rate is even more astonishing young and old work in the fields to bring forth more life but the people who grow the food are themselves malnourished the american cargo ships brimming with abundance have not relieved the misery of the masses a discouraging 80 percent of the populace still doesnt have enough to eat i sent my associate peter grant to bangladesh to find out why it didnt take him long to discover the main problem he noticed it as he was crossing the border in fact the bangladesh customs office looked like the twodollar window at a racetrack there was so much money changing hands grant reported unfortunately the customs office is not the most corrupt government agency that dubious honor goes to the food ministry which handles all the donated grain from overseas like the topsyturvy government agencies of george orwells 1984 the food ministry prevents food from reaching the nations neediest it does this through mismanagement and favortherich policies good weather and western shipments have combined to fill the granaries of bangladesh but its unlikely the oppressed poor will be eating much of that grain heres why most foreign grain donations go into the governments rationing system which grossly favors the welltodo members of society top priority is given to the armed services government employos police bank employes and other privileged categories next come the city dwellers at the bottom of the heap is the rural population who live in the most abject poverty the peasants are fed only if theres anything left over corruption is so widespread and accepted that the government automatically allows for it with a 5 percent loss factor figured into all grain transactions needless to say no transaction is made with less than the permitted 5 percent loss many government warehouse operators have grown fat on kickbacks drought is currently threatening bangladeshs most important rice harvest which means the food in warehouses is the only hedge against disaster yet western experts say that as much as 20 percent of the 1 4 million tons of stored grain may be damaged and 10 percent unusable grain is stored outside under plastic sheets though nearby warehouses have plenty of space to get rid of spoiling wheat the ministry recently sold it off at bargain pricesan open invitation to corruption sure enough the food controller of rajshahi was caught by a city mob with some 4 000 in his pocketkickbacks for selling good grain at the bargain price he was rescued from the angry mob by police bangladesh is just one example of a much too common

those who hold truly representational functions in their respective countries certainly the ipu suffers as do many international organizations from too much confrontation too little real communication

methods of improving conditions on this planet participation within the ipu has also reemphasized how much we have to cherish in our american institutions of free government we can demonstrate the strength and confidence of our system by showing up at these conferences by arguing the major issues and meeting those who oppose our nations policies face to face the lagos spring meeting considered several important issues and one in particular that will be of significance in the coming weeks in new york as the u n special session on disarmament carries out its work the ipu will te sending a special delegation to that u n session that will share with the united nations the results of work undertaken in lagos since its inception at the turn of the century the ipu has shown concern for the peaceful settlement of international disputes and can be considered one of the forerunners of international organizations such as the united nations therefore the ipu should have a role in important u n activity such as the special disarmament session that has just begun the spring ipu meeting was also an occasion when several western delegations registered again their strong concern about the situation in poland in fact european parliamentarians initiated an effort that led to the publication of a joint statement cosigned by representatives of 18 national groups this resolution calls particularly for the lifting of martial law and the immediate release of political prisoners in poland and it affirms that the problems of poland should be resolved exclusively and solely by the polish people without external pressure the fact that this joint statement was agreed to and circulated prominently at the ipu meeting attended by delegates from all over europe and the rest of the

that our policy is to plant fence row to fence row and that somehow the free market will take over somehow that will resolve all of our problems and at the time time we havt a secretary of state who interfere with the export markets and a director of the office of management and budget who is crouched off at the side of the chamber in an anteroom and directs the farm debate on that side of the aisle the fact is people who know about farming are not in control in this administration in dealing with farm problems that is the difficulty i want to underscore one point it is not that we do not have enough money to deal with farm problems there is money around here there was money around here when the administration asked this congress to pass a foreign aid bill 30 percent above the previous foreign aid bill this congress says we will pay we will pay there was money when the previous administration asked congress let us bail out chrysler and the people in washington said we will pay and then there was money when poland said we cannot pay our debts to the american banks and to the financial institutions of some 70 million interest the president says we will pay we will pay when it comes to the family farmer and the question of whether that farmer is going to keep that yard light on and keep doing chores when that farmer needs some time and some help to stay alive economically those voices are distant and are refusing to say we will pay we will pay paying does not mean charity it does not mean welfare it does not mean a giveaway it simply means that this country will commit ourselves to the kind of farm program that many countries have provided their farmers why is it that a tremendous import fee is imposed on a bushel of wheat when it hits the japanese shores it is because the japanese want to protect their farmers and have a farm program that gives their farmers more support then we give our farmers and that tariff acts as a shock absorber when a bushel of american wheat hits that shore they have a tariff that is attached to it and it is because japan cares about its farmers why is it they have a tariff in west germany it is for the same reason the fact is this country does not deal with its family farmers the most efficient food producers in the world in the same way that many other countries deal with theirs we ought to give our farmers a chance to make it just a chance to make it that is all they want"], [0.9588226415216923, 0.041177358478307724, 1, "i thank my colleague for his kind and generous remarks folks out our way in the upper midwest and the pacific northwest are concerned and that concern leads them to ask us to move toward a balanced federal budget most of us ini the congress including myself support that move toward a balanced budget however i do want to say this about that effort this nation has had several financial crashes and between the civil war and world war ii we had two long difficult depressions during those early years of american history up to world war ii there was violent dissension between labor and management we had a caste class system in america that was something like a european economic caste system but through it all the president of the united states in concert with the congress insisted and deman~ded that this nation have a balanced budget that was up until world war ii then since and after world war ii this nation has learned how to handle an unbalanced budget during those years when the budget has been unbalanced we have learned how to be flexible with the federal deficit and we have now gone 40 years without financial panic and without a depression unemployment during those years has never reached 10 percent as it consistently did during most of the years in which we did have a balanced budget so while i join my colleagues in wanting to move toward a balanced budget i think it would be wrongheaded with this congress this president or the people of this nation to worship continually at that altar nevertheless our people in the pacific northwest do want a balanced budget because they correctly want the federal government to begin to move out of the borrowing market that is necessary if we are going to bring interest rates down president reagan ostensibly wants to do that however under 9eintember 2 1981 president reagan the total defense budget will be 1 6 trilliontrilliondollars by the end of 1986 under president reagan we are cutting other spending by 560 billion but we are also cutting taxes by 718 billion economists quickly grasp that tax cuts will exceed spending cuts by as much as 103 billion a year so we continue to make policy from the white house and from a majority of those here in the congress which creates a tight money policy such policy in turn and there should be no mistake about this works as it restricts spending and investments from borrowed funds it creates idle plant capacity and unemployment and acts thus to restrain prices and wages in other words a tight money policy works best when it induces a recession and high interest rates are the antidote to supply side economics today our wrongheaded policies are being accepted on neither mian street nor wall street the administration says give us time trust us and they point to the technically correct fact that the presidents program has not yet taken effect and i accept that however the linchpin of the presidents economic policy is the establishment of good expectations across the land an end to the inflationary psychology which has permeated america yes the

several industries out there and those are industries important to us and important as well to the nationagriculture mining wood products and tourism those businesses all of them and most particularly the first three are in deep trouble let us look first at wood products timber our western lumber industry is operating between 25 and 40 percent below capacity how is that for increased productivity

rights the possible increase in discrimination is inherent in various provisions of the bill i have always been and i remain opposed to employer sanctions which after all are the real heart of this bill putting the onus of law enforcement on employers is simply not appropriate to this problem and the unitedstates chamber of commerce is justifiably opposed to this provision in addition i believe the employer sanction provision is discriminatory on its face with the prospect of fines and criminal penalties looming over each employer what employer would be willing to talk about employment to someone who looks or sounds foreign or bears a foreign surname i also remain adamantly opposed to the possibility of a national id card for all citizens in addition to the prospect of an orwellian nightmare this would simply be unworkable as quickly as a card would be devised a forgery would follow behind it the civil rights implications of the employer sanctions and possible id card requirement are profound indeed on the h2 workers provision after working for years to abolish the old bracero program under which the country suffered i am deeply concerned that we do not start up another such program i am afraid the h2 provisions will do just that and i am opposed to them i wholeheartedly support legalization however the bill does not go far enough i am deeply disturbed about the people the bill leaves in limbo due to the arbitrarily selected date for legalization and i am very concerned about the twoclass system set up in this legalization provision with its associated denial of federal benefits i am also concerned about the possible costs of legalization to the states and local governments and lets be very clear undocumented workers pay taxes even under this bill to be eligible for resident status they must show that they have not been nor are they likely to be public charges however in this period of recession all workers are precariously employed it is not clear if legalization will mean additional costs to state and local governments if it does the federal government should bear the burden of the cost the bill currently contains such language and it is crucial that this language be kept in this bill in addition to the problems in the bill that ive discussed this bill does not even address the management problems under which the immigration and

interior and insular affairs would authorize the secretary of the interior to engage in a feasibility study for the prairie bend unit of the picksloan missouri river basin program the proposed prairie bend unit would be located in central nebraska local entities have already contributed more than 400 000 to water quality studies and the bill requires the state of nebraska or some other nonfederal entity to participate and share in the cost of the feasibility study it is expected that the secretary of the interior will require that this share be a reasonable share and not merely a token contribution according to the bureau of reclamation the study will take 4 years to complete and will cost 1 600 000 enactment of the bill is supported by the administration the area where the prairie bend unit would be located is predominately agricultural with several rural towns private development of well irrigation has resulted in declining ground water levels deteriorating ground water quality and degradation of waterfowl habitat furthermore some of the creeks and drains in the area experience frequent flooding this study will examine the feasibility of a multipurpose project which would maintain a reliable irrigation ecomony through conjunctive use of ground and surface water provide flood protection assist in maintaining desired habitat for migratory birds provide for waterbased recreation improve ground water quality and regulate streamflows the inte> ir committee amended h r 5536 to require the secretary of the interior to include in the feasibility study a detailed report on any effects the proposed project might have on wildlife habitat including habitat of the shndhill crane and the endangered whooping crane the inclusion of this requirement demonstrates the committees particular concern over allegations that habitat for the sandhill crane and the endangered whooping crane might be adversely affected by the construction of this proposed project the committee makes it perfectly clear that the feasiblility study report should contain the type of detailed information relating to the effects the proposed project might have on wildlife habitat that will enable the congress to make an informed judgement should authorizing legislation for the project be proposed and considered i urge my colleagues to support this bill and i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.01689964532852173, 0.5168996453285217, 1, "let me first finish my statement and then i will be happy to yield that is the second difference the size of the tax bill and the continuity of it we agree that we ought to have tax cuts in 1983 and again in 1984 the only difference is that we think we ought to rut spending first to get the deficits down before cutting taxes that is a significant difference now the third difference is this where did the cuts occur wherec are the differences one major difference is the strategic petroleum reserve thle latta substitute says that somehow in some new yet undevised financing mechanism through the private sector we will save 3 billion on filling the strategic petroleum reserve beginning in october of this year there is not a single person to my knowledge who has testified to our committee or who has any hope that we are going to save 3 billion on the strategic petroleum reserve next year if we fill it at the rate we say we need to for our own national security and if we fill it and cannot pay for it in any other way we are going to have to come back and say we have to raise the budget we have got to pay for it so you may be casting a vote again to raise the budget to pay for the strategic petroleum reserve now let us take a look at some of the real cuts the gentleman from texas talked about and again we have to assume the administration will do what it says it wants to do in the elementary and secondary education area most specifically education for the handicappedthe administration assumes a 25percent cut beginning in october 1981 we think that is too large we think it is going to do damage to local school districts we think it is going to force local property taxes to increase we cut it 20 percent but we think 25 percent is too big thirty days from now if we pass the latta substitute we are going to have to vote cuts in education of 25 percent that is in the reconciliation recommendations in the school lunch program the administration assumes an immediate cutoff in october 1981 of the socalled middle class subsidy and a 43percent cut in the school lunch program immediately on october 1 that is in the reconciliation recommendations we will have to implement that 30 days from now both budget alternatives cut vocational education and job training somewhat the latta substitute which adopts the administrations proposals recommends at a time when we are cutting 350 000 young people from jobs that we also cut vocational education training below this years level by 150 million we fund this program to get it to this years level the latta substitute recommends cutting job training for these young people we say let us put in at least some money for the private sector job training for these people who we want to get into private employment there is a major difference there and we are going to be toting on that 30 days from now if we look at the agriculture budget 2 5 billion will have to be cut within the next 30 days under the latta substitute members may think if they come from a dairy state that they can vote for 75 percent of parity that is not true they have got to look at what the assumptions are that 2 5 billion means according to the secretary of agricultures own testimony 70 percent of parity we have got to understand that because how we vote today is the way we ought to vote tomorrow and next month another difference is the realism we tried in the committee to realistically look at the expectations at what rate next year are we going to have to borrow money what is unemployment likely to be what is the cpi likely to be those are costs to the government over which you and i and the president have no control they are automatic costs if we play alice in wonderland with those figures it does not mean they will go away we may wish that interest rates would go below 9 percent but that does not make it so if they are 12 percent we pay approximately 10 billion more automatically that means you are going to come back again with a red face and say oh im sorry folks i made a mistake i really was hoping those interest rates would be lower but we have got to pay it that is another difference that i will point out since it has been mentioned that we are playing with real bullets as the gentleman from texas"], [0.01692599058151245, 0.5169259905815125, 1, "i thank the gentleman very much not only his comments but also for his persistent and consistent support you know this is one of the issues that i get the feeling from time to time where the people in america have a better understanding of their government than some of the people in washington i think they really do understand what this is all about they may not articulate it with the same precise legal formulas that we are talking about here but they know that when they confront a situation whether it is a member of a local school board or the administrator of a hospital or someone who is making out their income tax that most of the things they are having to deal with are issues or rules or regulations that have been issued by persons who have never been elected and who are not accountable for those decisions it seems to me that we in this house need to be much more responsive to what the people in this country already understand that government by bureaucracy is not government by the people that the first article of the constitution did not accidentally vest the legislative powers in the congress of the united states it is i must confess frustrating it is not discouraging but it is frustrating to find such an ordeal in simply restoring to this institution the powers which the founding fathers envisioned that it would have you are the speaker of this house you are the leading member of this body of this institution it should be your role to act on behalf of this house in the exercise of its constitutional powers i understand there are controversial issues surrounding regulatory reform but i think it would be worse than a shame and a disgrace if the members of this house did not have the opportunity in a timely fashion to vote upon this i think it would be a reflection on the institution itself that could frustrate the desires of the members of this house in an overwhelming majority fashion to express the will of the american people we ought not to do that what concerns me is that the longer it is taking us to deal witll an issue of this sort the more the american people must wonder why h 4438 col therefore i urge you i plead with you do what you can to see that in a timely fashion this bill is brought to the floor of the house not in a manner that we see it here kicking and screaming reluctantly dragged out of the rules committee under some procedure but because that is what this house ought to be doing that is what the members want and that is what the american people want i will be glad to yield to the gentleman from pennsylvania"],

of the veterans disability compensation housing and memorial benefits amendments of 1981 public law 9766 makes clear that the obligation of the office of management and budget director to provide
