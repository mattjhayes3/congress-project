present congress with a stillborn budget proposal and then launch a media blitz complaining that congress was damaging chances for economic recovery by constantly delaying the budget process this administration keeps faulting congress for not immediately making hard choices necessary to prepare a budget that is tantamount to a doctor strangling his patient and then complaining because the clergy cant bring him back to life this administration has failed to make any hard choices in its travesty of a budget and now complains because congress struggles in building a consensus on budget priorities i have only been here 6 years but in those years and well before never has a president sent up a budget knowing it was doomed and then gone riding off into the sunsetleavins congress to struggle without a scintilla of presidential leadership this is a disgrace and the american people know where the blame lies it lies with the president of the united states and his colleagues yesterday and today we have tried to write a budget for the united states on the floor of the house of representativesand we will continue to try though as everett dirksen used to say there will be blood in the well up to our boottops before we are through i i have looked at all the substitutes and find their deficits with one exception because it has no deficit absolutely unacceptableand i believe the banking community wall street the american taxpayer the bluecollar and whiteshirted workers the labor leadership the small businessman and the corporate boardroom the family struggling to send their children to college or graduate school persons concerned with the environment the black community and minorities generally will also find them unacceptable the one exception to this view of course is the substitute offered by the geitleman from california but he balances his budget for 1983 on the backs of the elderly the poor the sick students farmers the housing automoble and steel indus tries and their workersand leaves essentially intact the unfair tax cuts and tax loopholes for corporations and wealthy individuals his sensitivity to human needs i need not dwell onhis substitute speaks for itself i just do not believe the american voter will return to office any member of the house of representatives or senator of whatever party who with a straight face presents a budget deficit for 1983 ranging from 96 8 billion to 109 4 billionand claims this was the best he or she could do and is in his constituents best interest if the white house likes scenarios this scenario is one of political suicide we all know that with a deficit of about 100 billion there will be no easing of interest rates you can have faith you can have trustand you can believe in this administrations economic policies if you care to but i respectfully suggest to you that this administration will still be forecasting the roaring back of the econom7 ad infinitum administration budget and economic experts must have known in their hearts that their deficit for 1983 was at the time they presented it in excess of 150 billion they also knew that their proposed defense increases and insistence on maintaining tax subsidies for the rich was feeding those deficits deficits which keep interest rates up workers unemploy d rnd families unable to buy homes cars clothes college educations for their children and the like administration economists of all people should have learned the lesson from franklin delano roosevelt when he said we have known that heedless selfinterest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics it is bad economics to fatten the rich even more than they are already bloated it is also bad short and longterm politics this administration is riding into the sunset of political oblivion with its economic brand exposed in full view to the american people k that brand spells greed and uncontrollable greed is exactly what we are seeing as the hallmark of this administration and its misguided and selfdestructive economic policies may i first talk about corporate tax subsidies the combination of accelerated depreciation leasing of tax credits plus investment credits means that all of corporate america will soon reach the zero rate of taxation already achieved by such profitable corporations as occidental petroleum ltv and burlington northern rather than helping directly those companies which should receive tax relief these budgets are helping out very profitable corporations at an extraordinary cost to the treasury the taxpayers and to the future economic recovery of this nation those special interests who gathered in washington for the lear jet weekend may find that in aiming to raid the treasurythey really ended up shooting themselves in the corporate foot the feeding frenzy generated around the federal tax trough degenerated into an exercise in timelapse cannibalism their tax benefits are costing the nation revenues it does not haveare hiking interest rates and the deficit to ungodly levelsand helping kill the recovery needed to generate their own profits and sustain healthy economic growth and the creation of jobs for the millions upon millions of anericans out of work besides reducing the revenue hemorrhageinduced by the tax benefit given to corporations and the wealthy last yearanother way in which we could cut the deficit is by repealing reducing or delaying the third year tax cut however neither the tiny net tax saving of the middle income nor the several thousands realized by those with income in six figures are justification for the economic p nalties we will all pay through persistent high interest rates if the third year tax cut is left untouched repeal or reductions in the third year tax cut are essential if money managers and investors are to be convinced of our determination to reduce deficits it is far better to adjust the third year tax cut ant thus lower interest rates and create jobs than to maintain a tax cut which guarantees that the unemployed do not even have incomes on which to pay taxes defense spending is the third area where significant federal revenues can be saved the president wants to increase defense spending by from 13 to 18 percent above inflation the house budget committee would increase defense spending by 5 percent above leflation while the committee proposaland otherscut actual spending for 1983 between 10 and 15 billion they are really merely nibbling at this mammoth fiscal cheese i maintain that before we have a truly credible defenseand one which we can sustain without seriously eroding the economywe must repair the economic damage this administrations policies have caused to our great productive economic machine better to reduce defense spending by 50 to 60 billion than risk continued and deepening recession of the economy while experiencing runaway inflation and horrendous cost overruns in the defense sector defense spending can and must be reduced significantly beyond what any of these budgets before us propose a delay of several years will not have the russians launching their strategic missiles at us assuredly cuba will not strike out at us our present military strength is such that no nation on earth would dare risk assured mutual destruction defense spending ranging from 191 to 214 billion as proposed by the various substitutes is just too high during this period of economic crisis i feel sure our allies in nato and around the world would feel far more secure s9eing a unitedstates economy in good healthwith rational interest rates with greater production and productivity and with a dollar valued to facilitate rather than dampen world trade as the saying goes when the american economy has a cold the world economy catches pneumonia these three revenue sources must be tapped the american worker running out of unemployment benefits has lost patience with this president and this administration the congress must bite the bullet and present the american people with a budget which will foster economic growth and the creation of jobs for the mllions and millions out of work we must repeal or adjust the tax benefits passed out last year during a moment of fiscal drunkenness on the part of this administration and the congresstax benefits which i happened to have voted for unfortunate ly we must repeal or adjust the third year tax cutwhich again i voted for unfortunately we must reduce defense spending to a level consistent with economic realities we cannot accept continuing deficits in the 100 billion plus renge in spite or what our republican savior the gentleman from new york has said interest rates will not come down if deficits remain at current or higher levels we must secure the revenues necessary to achieve that and the areas i have indicated are those which i believe will produce increased revenues without cutting off economic recovery good government costs moneyby good government i mean that which helps peoplenot hurts them we should be investing in a government that truly cares for those who cannot care for themselves to have carelessly defaulted in his leadership responsibilities on the budget indicates that this president is greatly at odds with the view the vast majority of americans hold of the american government and its responsibilities i believe this president and those around him truly misread the american people they listen too much to the rhetorical grumblings and not enough to what the people really feel the american people instinctively understand what teddy roosevelt and his cousin franklin talked about when they used the word national the american people want a government that works and not one that is to be dismantled to oblige the greed and ideological liturgy of destruction espoused by this presidents wealthy cronies i have voted against all substitutes put before the house i shall continue to

han corporation stocks of agricultural in commodities into liquid fuels and agriuel cultural commodity byproducts lco the legislation further provides the secretary with discretion to establish the the terms and conditions under which my the corporations stocks are to be of made available for processing by liquid ite fuel producers the liquid fuels prope duced may be made available by the vel corporation to federal agencies either al to help them meet their immediate ces needs for transportation and industriaod al fuels or for storage for later emerbe gency fuel uses in addition the secreion tary is given authority to sell the liquid fuels in commercial markets provided any sale does not disrupt commercial markets for the liquid fuels the measure also instructs the secretary in determining the feasibility of offering corporation stocks of agricultural commodities for processing into liquid fuels and agricultural commodity byproducts to consider the likely cost to the federal government of retaining ownership of the stocks in their original form the impact of excessive supplies of governmentowned stocks in depressing agricultural commodity prices and the value and usefulness of the stbcks as liquid fuels and agricultural commodity byproducts h r 6142 was approved by the committee on agriculture on a unanimous voice vote and enjoys the support of 30 members of the house including the chairman of the subcommittee on fossil and synthetic fuels mr sharp prospects for record grain production and carryover levels increasing acquisitions of grain under the price support activities of the commodity credit corporation a reversal in the long series of yeartoyear increases in u 9 farm exports and the failure of the united states to attain adequate jelfsufficiency in the production of liquid fuels confirm the need for directing a significant portion of unitedstates agricultural production toward fostering the continued growth of the young domestic alcohol fuels industry recent projections by the unitedstates department of agriculture forecast record unitedstates production of major farm commodities including corn 8 32 billion bushels wheat 2 82 billion bushels and soybeans 2 31 billion bushels the 198283 season carryover estimated for corn alone is a record of 2 8 billion bushels which far surpasses historical levels this anticipated production has pressured farm prices to severely depressed levels and sharply increased expected outlays for farm price support programs current price quotations in local markets for 1982 crops of wheat corn and soybeans are well below 3 50 2 and 5 per bushel respectively recently the estimate for projected commodity credit corporation outlays for its price support activities was doubled to nearly 11 billion the expected record crops threaten to tax the grain handling and storage system as never before new storage facilities are being constructed at a rapid pace and the federal government is approving for commercial storage facilities that were once considered substandard and inadequate to miintain grain in proper condition not only are private stocks of grain held on the farm and in commercial elevators accumulating to record levels govbrnment stocks of farm commodities are also building rapidly as producers forfeit to the commodity credit corporation grain used to secure government price support loans by the end of the 198283 marketing year usda projects that cccowned stocks of corn will increase by at least 150 million bushels to nearly 400 million bushels the estimated firstyear cost to ccc of assuming ownership of a bushel of corn is estimated to be at least 0 80 per bushel when commercial storage rates transportation and handling charges forfeited interest on the loan and forgone firstyear interest revenue on the grain in ccc possession are considered in addition given current severe restrictions on cccs authority to return grain under its ownership to commercial markets as well as prospects for continued depressed farm prices in the near term ccc is likely to own this grain at substantial additional cost for some time one of the primary reasons that agriculture finds itself in a depressed state is the deterioration in the farm export outlook the burden of record agricultural surpluses has been compounded by this reduction in the value of unitedstates farm exportsthe first such reduction since 1969 in addition certain commodities are experiencing a reduction in export volume as well as value corn export shipments for example are at a 5year low the dismal prospects for resumed strong growth in unitedstates export markets point to the need for developing additional domestic outlets for our grain production the development of an established alcohol fuels industry offers the potential for creating substantial new domestic demand for grain a goal which if realized could lead to strong and stable prices for american producers a mature alcohol fuels industry could also serve as a model for current efforts to promote the value added production and export for unitedstates goods for example those alcohol producers using the wet milling process can obtain from one 56pound bushel of corn 2 5 gallons of anhydrous ethanol 1 7 pounds of corn oil 3 pounds of corn gluten meal a 60percent protein product 14 5 pounds of corn gluten feed a 21percent protein additive and 15 pounds of highgrade carbon dioxide in addition wetmilling facilities have the flexibility to reduce their ethanol production in favor or producing high fructose corn syrup in a dry milling facility 2 5 gallons of ethanol and nearly 17 pounds of a 26 to 32percent protein material call dried distillers grain ddg remain after the process according to a 1981 study by the unitedstates department of energys office of alcohol fuels based on mid1981 corn prices unitedstates onp would increase by 1 89 for each bushel of corn diverted from the export market to produce ethanol similar studies have projected the increased employment national income and balance of payments benefits that would likely accrue to the united states if a strong alcohol fuels industry were established contrary to the current widely held perception sales of gasoline alcohol blend fuels have not declined in the face of the curent oil glut and period of moderate gasoline prices as the information in the tables below relates alcohol blend fuelscommonly marketed today as super unleaded with ethanol or unleaded plus r ither than gasohol are attaining a steadily

occurred when the president of the united states journeyed from the white house to the capitol to visit with the leadership of the other body and the leadership of the house it was the culmination of a long and serious effort to develop a compromise accept able to the leaders of both parties and the leaders of both branches of the legislature and to the executive branch after 3 hours of discussion it was obvious that there was no ground for compromise i think the underlying explanation of most value to the american c itizen looking at a period of high interest rates high unemployment asking what is happening in washington the most accurate explanation was given by the majority leader of the other body howard baker of tennessee and the speaker of this house tip oneill who both said in separate interviews what it boiled down to was a question of different philosophies speaker oneill was statesmanlike and candid in his assessment of president reagan he said i think he is a sincere man who genuinely believes that his tax cut program will work similarly those of us who disagree with speaker oneill should give him his due he also is asincere man since 1l52 as a member of this house for 30 years he has worked to build a liberal welfare state for 30 years as a member of this house he has worked to build that liberi welfare state for 28 years he has been in the majority he has belonged to the people who have run the house of representatives and for those 28 years that majority with speaker oneill as part of it has worked to build the liberal wel^are state he has presided over deficits under four presidents as majority leader under richard nixon as speaker under gerald ford under jimmy carter and under ronald reagan he is accustomed to the politics of the liberal warfare state by 1980 his efforts had produced 21percent interest rates 13 percent inflation rates a decaying automobile industry a collapsing housing industry and a country faced with a crisis in small business and in jobs his party had become the party of weak defense big spending high taxes high interest rates and job destruction faced with repudiating a lifetimes work by compromising with the president or walking away from the chance for a compromise and sticking to the liberal welfare state principles that had guided his career i think the speaker did something which was honorable and consistent with his own record but there are many members of this congress who happen to be democrats but have not had the same career do not have the same commitment and we are now seeking to build a bipartisan coalition of democrats and republicans who have given up on the centralized liberal welfare state who realize that the politics of big government big spending high taxes high interest rates will destroy jobs and will put americans out of work we hope the democrats of the younger generation we hope the democrats who are not committed to the liberal welfare state we hope the democrats who understand the economic sickness of 1980 will join with us if we cannot have a compromise of leaders then let us have a compromise of members let us work together to find a budget which will put people back to work will bring down interest rates and will bring together the members of both parties in an effort to find a real solution we ask no one to switch parties although we are delighted with those who do so we ask no one to give up their traditional ties all we ask is the democrats willing to place country above partisanship look at the current economic crisis and agree to join us the type of medicine that would make america healthy is simple first keep the tax cut which on july 1 will increase the number of real dollars in americans paychecks which will give americans a better chance to go out in their neighborhood to buy a car to buy a house to make the investments and the savings that will get this country moving again second cut federal spending including some cuts in defense spending in order to bring down the deficit so that the federal government will not borrow so mqch money so that the interest rates will fall so that small business can survive so that we can go back to creating jobs in the automobile and housing industries third pass a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget that will by itself bring down interest rates as the money markets come to realize that we have in fact reached a historic watershed and that we are moving on to an era in which the government will be disciplined and in which we

will bring down borrowing will lower interest rates and will create jobs asking for cooperation a sign of putting america above partisanship is the first step second they can ask their congressman to

the serious threat to federal student assistance caused by the reagan administrations refusal to process pell grant applications for the coming academic year we are all aware of the importance of the pell grant program in providing basic grant assistance to college students from low and middleincome families the processing of pell grant applications by the department of education is not only essential if these basic grant awards are to continue but colleges and universities across the country will be unable to calculate their own financial aid awards until pell grant determinations are complete i should stress that the issue at hand now is not the level of funding for the pell grant program regardless of what level of funding the congress approves for student aid grants the law provides a method for reducing grant awards in the event of less than full funding of the pell grantprogram yet without any clear statutory authority the administration has halted processing of student aid applications and is pursuing alternative regulations for the program i can only view the administrations actions in failing to consider pell grant applications in a timely fashion as irresponsible and grossly insensitive to the needs of students and their families the administration has ignored the law in carrying out its administrative responsibilities and is now approaching a point at which it may in effect freeze student aid funds which have been lawfully appropriated by the congress our memories must not be so short that we forget the lessons of a decade ago which led to

time and incurring substantial legal costs moreover in a few cases plaintifflawyers have succeeded in arguing propositions that defy all notions of commonsense and fairness for example the highest court of new jersey determines that a manufacturer may be liable because it failed to warn product users of a potential harm notwithstanding the scientific impossibility of knowing that the product could cause that harm similarly courts in several states have held that a manufacturer may be liable for injuries caused by a product despite the lack of proof that it actually made the product the

legislation that the majority leader the other day held in his hand and shook into our faces with justification and reminded us all how that piece of legislation running over 800 pages was adopted by this house without having been seen or read by practically anybody including the sponsors that was able to be done because of the socalled reconciliation provision of the budget act it is not only members of this body who understand what an awful thing we did last year and how we totally perverted the legislative process for what we proudly talk about as the peoples house kept the people totally in the dark as to what it was that we were doing in the dead of night time magazine on april 26 of lhis year described our action a year ago in this way unfortunately the result was a bill that whatever its economic merit or lack of same ranks as one of the sloppiest pieces of legislation ever approved by congress it was a shambles of bits and pieces containing unnumbered pages and handwritten notes yet congress was awed by a president who claimed a mandate for change and had a gift for persuading the public it tamely adopted a budget that made a mockery of recent reforms and insulted the legislative process now what the budget committee did last year as it did the year before under the carter administrationand that is why i say this is really bipartisanis to come to this house with a recommendation that as part of the first budget resolution we provide for the adoption of a socalled reconciliation bill which would mandate the adoption of legislation forcing the cuts which were incorporated in the first budget resolution now what is wrong with that what is wrong with it is that as the budget act was first adopted in 1974 under the management of our distinguished rules committee chairman the gentleman who is now presiding as chairman of the committee of the whole house it was intended that the first budget resolution would be simply a target would set goals for us there was to be nothing final or fixed about it that was supposed to come later when we knew what the economic conditions were of the year to see whether the assumptions of the spring still held in the fall last year for example by the time we got around to the second budget resolution we were 40 billion more in deficit than we had anticipated we would be in the springtime and yet we were stuck we had already adopted the reconciliation bill the distortion that has taken place with a 40 billion mandated cut last year and i believe about 8 billion the year before has led some to suggest that if that process continues we will not have the constitutional separation of powers that was intended by the founders of this nation nor would we have this congress composed of equal members doing their jobs as equal members indeed look at the situation that we face today we came here this week after a select group of people having spent some 3 months on all kinds of numbers and assumptions and projections they had meetings among themselves and they held meetings with the executive branch and then they held meetings with the senate and they came to an impasse but they came to

seen a concerted effort on the part of the administration to impose controls on the free flow of information from the government to the public as well as between scientists in the united states and those overseas this is a most ominous development with farreaching implications that i do not believe the administration has fully grasped several actions on the part of the executive add up to a most worrisome picture it has been well publicized that new policies are being implemented which will restrict contacts between government officials and the press in addition a new executive order is being drafted which will give government officials greater authority to invoke national security to keep information from the public through the classification procedure the administration is also moving to rewrite the provisions of the freedom of information act which has served the nation so well since its enactment in 1966 in such a way as to restrict both the material that can be made public and those who may demand the information finally and equally troublesome are the efforts at restricting the flow of scientific information by use of the classification procedure by censorship prior to publication and by means of regulations based on the authority of the arms export and control actadministered by the department of commerceand the international traffic in arms regulationsadministered by the state department admiral inman deputy director of the central intelligence agency produced at the recent annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science a list of subjects for classification or restriction that includes crop forecasting computer software and computer hardware it is not difficult to see the sweeping range of those i roposals in response to criticisms th the national security agency had not made its case for classifying certain cryptographic material admiral inman responded this reasoning is circular and unreasonable the specific details of why information must be protected are often even more damaging than the information itself this justification in itself is a brilliant exercise in circular reasoning it requires that the public place absolute faith and power to control information in the hands of these gentlemen admiral inman then proceeded to characterize scientists arguments for free flow of information as being motivated by selfinterest entirely disregarding the societys stake in this freedom every new administration inevitably goes through a phase of believing it is more important to stem leaks of sensitive or embarrassing material rather than dealing with the substance of the issue while this is understandable we must remain on guard because this administration more than any other stands a good chance of codifying this institutional paranoia into the laws of the land once again we witness the banner of national security being raised to justify all manner of restrictions on the free and necessary flow of information the nation has grown weary of this demagoguery especially when the sweepingly road concept of national interest is freely used in place of national security this nation was founded by individuals who had a healthy distrust for government based not on ideology but on personal experience of its excesses in consequence every effort was made to define rights responsibilities and individual restrictions by means of statutes enacted by congress so as not to fall victim to the capricious interpretations by faceless bureaucrats or officials with narrow perspectiver of the democratic process i believe this is not in contradiction with the present administrations philosophy national security is too important to be left to security specialists alone congress and the executive should be especially careful with language in this area spelling out clearly what is meant by national security they must recognize explicitly that information which is merely embarrassing to government officials does not qualify for being suppressed under the rubric of national security or even national interest quite the contrary such information is properly a part of the public domain for without it the constitutionally mandated system of checks and balances becomes inoperative the oversight function of congress was instituted precisely to deal with competing interests conflicts of policy inefficiency waste and mismanagement restrictions on the public dissemination of governmental information inevitably translates into congiessional ignorance on key matters lor it is well known that congress functions by reacting to public concerns not by initiating public debate for congress to acquiesce to the executives efforts in restricting information is to abdicate its constitutional role beyond the petty issues of embarassing revelations lies the larger question of striking an appropriate balance between the publics rightand needto know and genuine concern for national security matters this is a valid and difficult question precisely because of this it is imperative that the public through it5 elected representatives participate in the process of deciding what it chooses not to know for the sake of the good of the nation as a whole unfortunately this administration has failed to recognize the fact that the publics need to know is fundamental to the workings of a democratic nation and that the press is the sehicle by which this right is exercised the executive appears to view the press as yet another selfserving special interest group and the publics need to know as merely a manifestation of an inappropriate curiosity through its actions regarding revisions of the freedom of information act the new executive order on classification of sensitive material its restrictions on contacts with the press and regulations that restrict communication within the scientific community the administration is effectively shifting the burden of proof of need to know to the end user on a casebycase basis while at the same time eliminating some of the vehicles by which the user might establish such need this in itself is prima fade evidence that the administration does not accept the publics need to know as a right this contradictory situation is further aggravated by the fact that if the public is not aware of the existence of certain important information it will not know to ask for it through the remaining channels fortunately the administrations moves toward information control have met with unprecedented resistance the washington post of january 22 1982 reports vocal protests to the national security adviser by reporters who cover the state department indicating that the change in policy is having chilling effects with officials now reluctant to discuss or even explain basic points of policy universities find themselves in open confrontation with the government refusing to abide by its restrictive regulations regarding meetings with foreign scientistslos angeles times january 20 1982 the otherwise staid national academy of sciences has refused to act as an intermediary between the universities and the state department because it would reflect acceptance of its restrictive policieswashington post january 21 1982 the governing council of the american association for the advancement of science the nations most prestigious scientific society passed a resolution on january 7 1982 disapproving of the governments policies whereas freedom and national security are best preserved by adherence to the principles of openness that are a fundamental tenet of both the american society and of the scientific process be it resolved that the american association for the advancement of science opposes governmental restrictions on the dissemination exchange or availability of unclassified knowledge professional and academic journals are filled with editorials strongly opposing attempts to restrict the flow of scientific information i wish to call to the attention of my colleagues three such statements one by prof edward gerjouy from the university of pittsburgh who chairs the panel on public affairs of the american physical society another by prof stephen unger from columbia university and an excellent editorial by daniel s greenberg the editor and publisher of the washington based science government report editorials appended there is another aspect of this question that must not be forgotten the united states leadership in the field of communications and data processing the united states has held long standing bipartisan policies aimed at facilitating and preventing restrictions on transnational data flows which are very important to international trade and to the functioning of many unitedstates firms that operate overseas we have argued strenuously for the benefits of unrestricted data flow and against the imposition of restrictions on communications such as through the new world information order the administrations actions regarding the flow of information leaving the united states are in direct contradiction to these long standing policies and invite retaliation from other nations which could severely cripple unitedstates leadership trade position as well as intelligence gathering ability for these reasons it is imperative that congress not deal with each of the administrations actions in a piecemeal fashion but be aware of the overall picture they represent if we were on a war footing perhaps the measures proposed by the administration might be justifiable for a short interval but we arenot and the damage and costs that will have to be borne if we accede to the kinds of restrictions envisioned will be farreaching it is ironic that in the single minded pursuit of the antisoviet posture that characterizes this administrations policies we should end up using precisely the same methods of information control for which we so fault them"],

he prefers but moreover you are denying the american people a vote they want to move more swiftly and assuredly to a balanced budget in this is no procedural vote as the gentleman from mississippi

the requisite number of words and i rise in opposition to the amendment i think it will be useful for just a moment to review what we are talking about today the binary system itself is safe environmentally while the existing stockpile is not safe environmentally it is pretty basic is it not but this is because two separate inert agents are involved in the binary system and only become lethal when joined logether from a storage and handling stand point therefore the binary munition is absolutely safe existing chemical munitions for which this would be a substitute are extremely dangerous plans call for only one of the agents of the binary munitions to be located for example at pine bluff ark in this particular case ql which is the phosphorus ester and could be commercially produced would be located at pine bluff the other agent is powdered sulfur and would be shipped to a separate facility for storage the agents would onlyonly ever be brought together at the battle station if they were to be used in an action now for the second moment i would like to examine the point of this amendment because what is its point nerve gas mustard gas poison gas what is the point of the amendment we have already on hand old deteriorating lethal stockpiles which exist the issue is not whether we will be in the chemical gas business we are already there the issue is not to have or have not we already have where are the present chemical storage sites one may ask and i will provide the answer we have a chemical storage site at tooele army depot in utah anniston army depot in alabama another located in lexington blue grass depot activity in kentucky we have another of the unitary systems at pine bluff arsenal in arkansas another at umatilla depot activity in oregon at pueblo depot activity in colorado newport army ammunition plant in indiana at the edgewood arsenal md johnston island and in west germany the unitary system exists it is largely unusable and it is extremely dangerous so the issue today really is what kind of agent shall we have if we are not to have the unitary systcm shall we disarm unilaterally or shall simply replace the system in my judgment a proposition which will be offered deserves our support which will involve a tradeoff as we build the binary system into the military structure and at the same time phase out the unitary system which is so extremely dangerous to our civilian population the important difference between this country and that of the soviet union is the fact that we do not plan to use ours ours is a deterrent ours is a negotiating tool why in the world do we not decide to update the old dangerous system to make it safer for ourselves far better it is to have this agent in our hands than those of

members of the committee on public works and transportation and the subcommittee on surface transportation and i introduced h r 3210 the federalaid highway act of 1981 this legislation essentially was a 1year bill which contained increased budget authority in certain of our contract authority federalaid highway programs to bring the total authorizations up to the level recommended by the new administration to be certain the administration did propose and send to congress a bill significantly restructuring these programs and did suggest the adoption of multiyear legislation because of the relatively late submission of these proposals because the congress spent so much of its time fashioning our omnibus budget reconciliation act and because of our may 15 deadline for reporting authorizing legislation from the committee as mandated in the 1974 budget act it was felt that there was not sufficient time to carefully consider a comprehensive restructuring of our highway program which would certainly have a long lasting impact on the nations transportation infrastructure since may 15 the surface transportation subcommittee has held 8 days of hearings in washington and in the field on the countrys future transportation needs it is only now in the closing days of the 1st session of the 97th congress that i feel comfortable drafting legislation which will play such a significant role in shaping the future of our countrys transportation policy i am convinced it would have been a grave error to undertake such an effort before we had increased our knowledge and enhanced our awareness of the problems and challenges facing us to the extent that we have today this is not to say that we failed to resp~ond in drafting h r 3210 to the initiatives put forward by the administration as i have previously stated the authorization levels contained therein did conform to those recommended by the white house and perhaps more significantly with the leadership of the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from california we embraced and adopted the concept posited by the administration to redefine the nations interstate system as some of my colleagues may be aware 1981 marks the 25th anniversary of the interstate system fewer perhaps are cognizant of the fact that most of the system is constructed with a design life of 20 to 25 years we have now reached the point then when 95 percent of the total system is open to traffic but when also an increasing proportion of these miles are in need of reconstruction indeed one study has reported that the amount of interstate miles rated in poor condition more than doubled between 1975 and 1978 with another doubling anticipated by 1985 clearly this is a problem which must be addressed as passed in this chamber on september 24 h r 3210 added reconstruction to the interstate 3r programresurfacing restoration and rehabilitationto create a new 4r program funding for this program was increased from 275 million to 800 million additionally a more equitable formula was devised for distributing these funds among the states in passing h r 3210 this body was by no means neglectful of the very important job of completing the interstate system indeed the meeting of this challenge was facilitated by that bill and will be brought closer to fruition by the amendment that is before us today mindful of the increased costs of freeway construction and our present budgetary constraints that bill and this amendment will allow us to focus the nations precious financial resources on the most crucial work that remains to be done certain nonessential projects on the interstate system are being dropped from the interstate cost estimate any project previously eligible under the ice but now dropped will be eligible under the expanded 4r program there were certain differences between items maintained under the ice in the house and senate bills this chamber for example maintained in the construction program all high occupancy vehicle lanes contained in the 1981 ice the senate bill failed to include this important provision but it is included in the amendment that is brought to the floor today by redefining eligibility for the interstate construction program we are able to reduce the interstate cost estimate from about 53 billion to about 38 8 billion this constitutes a sayings not even accounting for future inflation of about 14 billion let me repeat that by voting for this amendment we can save the american taxpayer 14 billion in the cost of completing the interstate system and by trimming these costs we will be expediting system completion by funneling available funds to those projects which are most crucial this amendment is vitally needed for the longrange implications it will have on the interstate program its enactment is also of very great shortterm significance the department of transportations authority to apportion interstate construction funds among the states expired at the end of fiscal year 1981 when our colleagues passed hi r 3210 earlier this year we extended that authority and revised the apportionment factors to reflect the redefinition of the system when it became apparent that hi r 3210 would not be enacted by october 1 house concurrent resolution 179 was brought to the floor and passed allowing the secretary to apportion interstate construction funds using our old factors that legislation was never adopted by our colleagues in the other body so these funds have been frozen in washington for over 10 weeks passage of this amendment will relieve that situation and relieve it in a most favorable manner by not only allowing these funds to be apportioned but by allowing them to be apportioned utilizing our redefined factors h r 3210 as passed by the house was significantly amended in the other body on november 16 and sent back to us the other body would have us hastily consider many of the same program revisions we chose to more thoroughly and thoughtfully examine next year since november 16 led by my good friend the gentleman from new jersey we have been working with senate leaders to fashion a compromise approach i feel that the substitute being considered today is that compromise it preserves the integrity of the legislation previously passed in general approach and in substantial detail i would urge that it be passed here today and sent back to the other chamber so that it may be expeditiously approved there according to assurances that have been given to us and sent to the white house for enactment"]]}
