judge merrick garland to replace the late justice antonin scalia on the supreme court of the united states judge garland is an extraordinarily qualified candidate highly esteemed within the legal community and highly accomplished as a prosecutor and appellate judge he was confirmed to the d c circuit court of appeals in 1995 by a vote of 7623 with a majority of republicans voting in favor of his confirmation indeed an even larger number of republicans said he was well qualified and i will speak to that under normal circumstances judge garland would now be sitting down this week for oneonone meetings with senators on both sides of the aisle in preparation for his confirmation hearings but senate republicans unfortunately have made it clear that they will not be operating under normal procedure instead they are refusing even to meet with judge garland let me suggest they are refusing to do their duty their approach is inconsistent with the expectations of our founding fathers and a disservice to the american people to the court to american justice and to the american people and their justification has no basis in fact justice anthony kennedy who sits now on the court was confirmed during the final years of president reagans second term in fact he is one of the 14 justices in our history who have been confirmed during a presidential election year including louis brandeis and benjamin cardozo so there is hardly precedent that a lame duck president must allow a supreme court vacancy to sit unfilled for months we do not allow that for the house of representatives and for the most part we dont allow it for the united states senate there is a timeframe indeed in every state to fill seats in the house of representatives so that the american people will be represented to politicize this process is irresponsible and jeopardizes the proper functioning of our supreme court in 1988 during the kennedy confirmation process president reagan said the federal judiciary is too important to be made a political football i agree and i hope senate republicans would too because we all know that their decision has nothing to do with judge garlands qualifications senator hatch a republican from utah in 1997 called judge garland highly qualified and said his intelligence and his scholarship cannot be questioned when put forward for the d c circuit court judge garland was cited by senator hatch as a fine nominee he ultimately voted to confirm judge garland to the d c circuit court while chairman chuck grassley who chairs the judiciary committee on the senatealso a republicanopposed judge garlands nomination to the circuit court it ought to be noted that it was only because he thought there were already too many judges on that bench not because judge garland lacked qualifications in fact senator grassley made this clear by saying i have nothing against the nominee mr garland seems to be well qualified and would probably make a good judge on some other court senator jeff sessions a conservative republican from alabama agreed with senator grassley about too many judges on the circuit court and said of judge garland i would feel comfortable supporting him for another judgeship although he didnt say it but another judgeship would be a justice on the supreme court of the united states now senator grassley and senator sessions have an opportunity to put judge garland on another courtone that has a vacancy needing to be filled our founding fathers set up a court of nine justices cognizant of the problem that would occur if there were a 44 tie that is the situation that exists today and it can be remedied by the united states senate now lets not play political games if republicans dont want judge garland on the court schedule a vote and cast their votes accordingly senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said just yesterday on abcs this week under the constitution we have a shared responsibility this is not something he referring to the president does alone he nominates we confirm that of course is absolutely accurate i would say to senator mcconnell that the president has met his responsibilities now it is time for the senate to do so as well some senate republicans agree senator mark kirk of illinois said on friday cast a vote the tough thing about these senatorial jobs is you get yes or no votes your whole job senator kirk observed is to either say yes or no and explain why that is democracy that is responsibility furthermore in february senator susan collins republican of maine said i think the obligation of the senate is to carefully consider any nominee whom the president submits the best way to do that in my judgment is public hearings senator collins was absolutely right under pressure from within their own ranks senate republican leaders can only stall for so long before they must face up to their responsibility to give judge garland the fair hearing he deserves and that the american people expect i believe judge garland will make a fine supreme court justice and i thank president obama for selecting someone so highly qualified intelligent and whose scholarship cannot be questioned a fine nominee all of those of course are senator hatchs words i hope that judge garland will be swiftly confirmed leaving the supreme court with the possibility of gridlock as we have seen the congress at gridlock is not good for our country not good for the american people and does not serve our democracy well senator mcconnell hold hearings reflect upon judge garlands competency intellect and suitability to serve on the supreme court do your duty"], [0.007737994194030762, 0.9922620058059692, 1, "even more offensive in a display of colossal incompetence last week the republican leadership was forced to pull their entire interior appropriations bill to protect their conference from having to defend the display of the confederate battle flag on federal lands imagery long recognized as a symbol of hatred and intolerance as a result funding for critically important agencies such as the environmental protection agency whose programs protect wildlife the environment and public health continues to hang in the balance this rule first provides for consideration of h r 2898 the western water and american food security act of 2015 which republicans claim will alleviate the drought crisis currently unfolding in california and other western states but this bill is just another example of the countless partisan attempts made by the majority to roll back important environmental protections while also preempting state laws let me put a footnote right there preempting state laws these are the people that argue state rights and now would preempt them in western portions of our great country particularly california reducing water management flexibility this bill undercuts the endangered species act by changing the welldefined standard used to determine when an action negatively affects an endangered species and introduces an untested undefined standard as evidenced by this piece of legislation the republicans solution to the drought crisis is to provide handouts to big agricultural interests at the expense of the environment and everyone else i want to make it very clear that i represent agricultural interests as do my colleagues who are republicans we represent all of the specialty crops and sugarcane grown and we understand these dynamics very well not only will this bill scale back desperately needed environmental protections it will affect thousands of fishing jobs in california and oregon that local residents depend on given the changing standard of the endangered species act this bill will dramatically weaken protections for salmon and other fish and wildlife in californias baydelta estuary this bill claims to help california but even california doesnt want it californias own secretary of natural resources has said that this billand let me quote himwill reignite water wars move water policy back into the courts and try to pit one part of the state against another this bill will elevate the water rights for certain agricultural contractors over the existing water rights that benefit refuges and wildlife areas in short this bill circumvents californias groundbreaking equitable water conservation programs and puts the desires of big agriculture over everyone else this combined rule also provides for the consideration of h r 3038 termed the highway and transportation funding act of 2015 part ii because it is yet another shortterm temporary patch to ensure that the highway trust fund does not become insolvent it is a patch it is the ninth time we are patching if you had a tire and were riding down a highway and if every time you looked up you had to have another patch pretty soon you would recognize that you would need new tires what we need in this country is a 6year highway bill back in may congress passed and the president signed a bill we can now appropriately call the highway and transportation funding act of 2015 part i at that time we were assured by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that a multiyear bill that would provide the longterm funding certainty and stability needed to keep transportation and construction projects operating was on the horizon that was in may we were promised that if we voted to provide funding through july 31 the comprehensive multiyear highway bill america so desperately needs would become a reality in time to avoid any insolvency unfortunately today we find ourselves in the same situation as we did in may i just heard my good friend from washington make the argument that in the next 6 months we will be able to work together to do the things necessary for a 6year highway bill i am paraphrasing what he said as we had in may today we have a rapidly approaching selfimposed deadline and are frantically seeking an interim fix like its predecessor this highway bill does nothing to address the longterm solvency of the highway trust fund there is one thing i have learned here about kicking the can down the road if kicking the can down the road were an olympic sport here in the united states congress we would win gold we would win bronze we would win silver and we would win aluminum for kicking the can down the road instead we are again being asked to vote for legislation that would keep the highway trust fund solvent through note the date of december 18 just before christmas so that we can play the game if you dont vote for this next patchif we dont do 6 yearsthen we will keep you here until christmas without the necessary assurances that a longterm bill will become a reality this is no way to govern our insistence on kicking the can down the road does nothing to protect american jobs or to invest in critical infrastructure that every man and woman in this house of representatives recognizes is desperately needed in this nation of falling bridges and pockmarked roads finally investing in our nations infrastructure and indeed in our nations future will require us to make tough choices instead of considering raising the federal gas taxi said the ugly words federal gas tax which is the primary source of funding for the highway trust fundand it has not been increased since 1993 peoplethis bill seeks to cut taxes on liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas at a cost of 90 million over the next decade any comprehensive highway bill must consider in part addressing the federal gas tax why dont we just face up to that go to our constituents and explain it to them so they will understand that this is a desperate need for this entire nation our failure to come together to pass a multiyear transportation bill year after year has resulted in 65 percent of our nations roads being rated deficient all you have to do is drive around washington to recognize that it has left 25 percent of our nations bridges in disrepair and it has left 45 percent of americans without access to transit this failure has farreaching and devastating implications and must be addressed with

alabama avenue in selma alabama as the amelia boynton robinson post office building mrs amelia boynton robinson was known as the matriarch of the voting rights movement her life and legacy epitomized strength resiliency perseverance and courage the same characteristics that embody the city of selma alabama my hometown where she made such a significant impact amelia boynton robinson was named the only female lieutenant to dr martin luther king jr during the civil rights movement in this role she would travel alongside dr king and often appear in his stead for numerous events and gatherings amelia boynton robinson was also well known for braving the frontline of the selma march on the edmund pettus bridge where she was brutally attacked and left for dead on bloody sunday on march 7 1965 it was the picture of a bloody and beaten amelia boynton that appeared on the front page of the new york times and showed the world the brutality of racism in the fight for voter equality during the violent attacks this heroine never gave up hope hope in an ideal that is all america it is democracy she believed so fervently that all americans should have the right to vote and she was willing to die for it it was the direct involvement of amelia boynton robinson and the foot soldiers who dared to march from selma to montgomery that led to the passage of the voting rights act of 1965 she was such a valued part of this process that some of the contents of the voting rights bill were drafted at her kitchen table in selma a courageous trailblazer even before bloody sunday amelia boynton robinson on may 5 1964 broke all barriers as the first black woman in the state of alabama to run for congress she ran to represent the seventh congressional district of alabama the seat i am so honored to hold today she garnered 10 7 percent of the vote during a time when very few blacks were registered to vote i know that the journey that i now take as alabamas first black congresswoman was only made possible because of the courage tenacity and faith of amelia boynton robinson last year before mrs boynton passed i was honored to have her as my special guest at the state of the union it was incredibly moving to see members of congress from both sides of the aisle and members of the presidents cabinet line up to greet her and to take pictures with her everyone thanked her for her service to this country even president obama came to talk and thank mrs boynton before he gave his address at the state of the union this picture documents that very time when she got to meet the president of the united states for the first time the memory of that moment will stand as one of the highlights of my time here in congress the symbolism of this picture is not lost on any of us it was truly because of her bravery and the bravery of other foot soldiers who dared to march like our very own colleague john lewis that paved the way for the election of this countrys first black president just a few months later on march 6 2015 she joined hands with our own president barack obama again to retrace the path that she took across the edmund pettus bridge on the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday when she and our colleague john lewis were beaten over 50 years ago amelia boynton robinson passed away just a few months later on august 26 2015 at the age of 104 she was featured prominently in the movie selma for her tenacity and her bravery she truly embodied what they were fighting for as foot soldiers i was so glad that before her death she was able to cross that bridge one more time and this time with two presidents president barack obama and president george bush so many of my colleagues joined us that day and we continue to honor her legacy by supporting this

against these bills power plants account for 40 percent of our annual carbon pollution emissions they are the single biggest source of carbon pollution in the country yet the republican majority wants

gift for big special interests at some point we must face the facts so i want to say something to my colleagues on the republican side i know it may make you feel uncomfortable but it is the truth climate change is real the overwhelming science says it is real yet a huge chunk of the republican conference is in denial they dont believe there is such a thing as climate change they dont believe

change is a serious issue it is a real issue it is an issue not just for us it is an issue for future generations so their denial quite frankly is frightening we shouldnt be propping up coal and oil industries with taxpayer subsidies we shouldnt be using taxpayer money to destroy our environment when the scientific community reaches a clear consensus on an issue like climate change congress shouldnt undermine them with dangerous legislation like this when we receive credible peerreviewed study after study after study after study that tells us we are in the middle of a climate crisis and that something must be done about it we need to listen but the republican majority refuses to listen climate change is often referred to as the most pressing issue of our time we know that climate change is for real we know that we see it we live it the scientific community has verified it climate change is not a theory it is not a hoax and it is certainly not some silly fantasy when arctic ice is crashing into the oceans at record rates that is not a hoax when species are going extinct at accelerated rates around the globe that is not a fantasy when extreme weather events are becoming commonplace that is not a theory when the global temperature of the planet continues to increase every year for decades we should pay attention these are the exact same scare tactics that have been used for over 45 years in opposition to climate change it is the same old stuff opponents of clean air have been claiming for half a century that clean air regulations would kill jobs and hurt economic growth but they are wrong the truth is that the clean air act alone has created 57 trillion in benefits since it was enacted in 1970 the clean power plan will lead to a stronger economy a

open to be able to ship to 96 percent of the worlds consumers which happen to be outside of the united states it is interesting to me when we talk about this because there are a lot of big businesses out there that have the ability and the resources to put a plant over in places like malaysia or germany or those other places it is the small businesses that oftentimes dont have that ability you heard me having a conversation with mr collins earlier about someone who came into my office who was talking about the fact that he manufactures tractors the tractors arent big tractors they are fairly small tractors but the tractors cost about 1 million apiece if they arent able to manufacture those tractors here in the united states in getting that exportimport bank financing they will go somewhere else they have a facility in france that they will be able to use those are jobs that are going to leave the united states i do believe that when we talk about the economic growth in manufacturing my district and i know many of the other districts of my colleagues here are heavy in manufacturing we are the fourth largest manufacturing district in the 10th district of illinois we have literally hundreds of jobs54 000in the district that rely upon exports i recognize that there are a lot of people who want to talk about boeing but boeing actually has three dozen suppliers in the 10th district of illinois these are three dozen businesses and hundreds of employees who support making things that go into a boeing plane you have heard the adage that when a boeing plane lands 21 000 small businesses land with it this is important this is talking about good highpaying jobs things that the exportimport bank absolutely helps support the thing that is interesting to me is that if we choose to not reauthorize the exportimport bank who loses our competitors overseas have export financing our small businesses will be the ones that lose we are going to in essence tie one hand behind our back and make us less competitive i cant think of a crazier thing that of making us less competitive we want to be more competitive we want to give our small businesses every advantage possible to be able to go out and compete and win this is what we have an obligation to do this is what we have an opportunity to do i am delighted to be able to stand up here with my friends to talk in a bipartisan way actually about why it is important that we reauthorize the exportimport bank it is because there are jobs and there are businesses in vernon hills in wheeling in lincolnshire in northbrook in waukegan in glenview in des plaines in gurnee in elmhurst in lake villa in bannockburn and in mount prospect these are all towns in the 10th district that have companies that utilize the exportimport bank this is not some random deal this is something that small businesses utilize in order to make sure that they can sell their goods to places all over the globe to places like france germany india and china it is super important that we give them the opportunity to not only make it here in america but to be able to send it all over the globe if we are looking for an opportunity to end a government program listen i am all for government accountability and for trying to make sure that the government is smaller and more responsive lets not focus on a government program that brings billions of dollars into the federal treasury and creates jobs we have heard about the crony capitalism frankly i think that we need to be focusing on how we help small businesses because again if we shut down the exportimport bank who loses it is our small businesses not the small businesses that they compete against that may be overseas because they will have an export financing arm as my friend mr collins was talking about before if the private sector and the private sector banks would do it i understand but there are a lot of those private sector banks and a lot of those local community banks even those midsized banks that see the collateral go overseas that they cant touch and that they cant get back when they walk in for 1 million of financing to send that tractor overseas the answer is no guess what they cant hire that next individual to create and make that tractor we need export financing we need to make sure that the exportimport bank has some restructuring this bill does some of that in terms of the bill that we are looking for to try to have some changes that go into the exportimport bank to make sure that we are having that appropriate oversight to make sure that we are holding them accountable but it is absolutely vital for good highpaying careers that the exportimport bank is reauthorized and reauthorized with an overwhelming support if it comes to the floor i am confident that this passes i want to thank my good friend from washington for bringing this up i want to thank my colleagues for standing up and supporting what we all know is going to be absolutely good for small business"], [0.9892194867134094, 0.9892194867134094, 0, "a matter of grave concern continues to arise stemming back from a man who was born in eritrea named abdurahman alamoudi and this is from discoverthenetworks org he mr alamoudi immigrated to the united states in 1979 that would be the same year you will recall that radical islam declared war on the united states attacked our embassy in tehran took over 50 americans hostage and held them for over a year that same year that year 1979 is the year mr alamoudi came to the united states and then he became a naturalized unitedstates citizen in 1996 in 1981 he founded the islamic society of boston it is not in this article but i have also seen the documentation of his founding and it is i think worth noting that the islamic society of boston that mr alamoudi founded the two mosques in the boston area one of which produced the tsarnaev brothers where they worshipped and learned more about islam this article says from 1985 to 1990 mr alamoudi served as executive assistant to the president of the saar foundation in northern virginia in 1990 alamoudi founded the american muslim council the following year he established the american muslim armed forces and veterans affairs council whose purpose was to certify muslim chaplains hired by the military during the 1992 presidential election cycle alamoudi courted both the democratic and the republican parties when bill clinton emerged victorious alamoudi increased his donations to democrats he went on to serve the clinton administration as an islamic affairs adviser and a state department goodwill ambassador to muslim nations in 1993 the defense department certified alamoudis american muslim armed forces and veterans affairs council as one of two organizations along with the graduate school of islamic and social sciences authorized to approve and endorse muslim chaplains among the chaplains endorsed by alamoudis group was james yee who eventually would be arrested in 2003 on suspicion of espionage it is very reassuring that this man arrested on suspicion of espionage here in the united states was certified by mr alamoudis group in march 1993 alamoudi disparaged the federal government for the flimsy evidence it had used as a basis for arresting mohammed salameh a suspect in the world trade center bombing of february 26 of 1993 salameh was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison on what apparently mr alamoudi thought was flimsy evidence it goes on in 1995 alamoudi helped president clinton interesting verb that helped alamoudi helped president clinton and the american civil liberties union develop a presidential guideline entitled religious expression in public school which established a legal justification upon which the aclu would file lawsuits restricting christmas celebrations and removing nativity scenes from public schools alamoudi made numerous controversial statements during the 1990s and early 2000s including these in 1994 he said hamas is not a terrorist group i have followed the good work of hamas in march 1996 alamoudi said he was honored to be a member of the committee that is defending islamic association of palestine or iap founder musa abu marzuk who in 1997 would be deported from the united states because of his hamasrelated activities i really consider him to be from among the best people in the islamic movement that is a quote from alamoudi alamoudi added hamas and i work together with him in december of 1996 as alamoudi continued to work with the clinton administration to find good muslims to work in the government alamoudi told a meeting of the iap i think if we were outside this country we can say oh allah destroy america but once we are here our mission in this country is to change it you can be violent anywhere else but in america in october 2000 alamoudi attended an antiisrael protest outside the white house where he proudly declared himself a supporter of hamas and a supporter of hezbollah and apparently there is video of that in 2000 alamoudi literally began making regular trips to libya where he met with government officials to discuss strategies by which they could create headaches for saudi arabia in january 2001 alamoudi attended a conference in beirut with leaders of numerous terrorist organizations including al qaeda hamas hezbollah and islamic jihad in june 2001 alamoudi was a guest speaker at a northern virginia conference where senior islamic militants from throughout the middle east were gathered many of the speakers denounced the zionist entity that aims to destroy the muslim ummah or community that same month alamoudi attended a briefing on president bushs faithbased initiative and the white house invited him to the post9 11 prayer service on september 14th at the national cathedral in washington in september 2003 british customs officials arrested alamoudi at heathrow airport as he was returning from libya with 340 000 in cash given to him by president muammar qadhafi to finance a plot involving two u k based al qaeda operatives intending to assassinate saudi crown prince later king abdullah alamoudi was subsequently extradited to the united states in october 2003 he was arrested at dulles airport on charges of having illegally accepted 10 700 from the libyan mission to the united nations with alamoudi in custody federal authorities released a transcript of a telephone conversation in which he had lamented that no americans had died during al qaedas 1998 bombing of the unitedstates embassy in kenya recommended that more operations be conducted like the 1994 hezbollah bombing of a jewish cultural center in buenos aires in which 85 people died and clearly articulated his objective of turning america into a muslim nation alamoudi was indicted not only for his illegal dealings with libya but also for tax evasion and immigration fraud he ultimately pled guilty to and was convicted of being a senior al qaeda financier who had funneled at least 1 million into the coffers of that terrorist organization he also acknowledged that he had pocketed almost 1 million for himself in the process in october 2004 alamoudi was sentenced to 23 years in federal prison during the holy land foundation for relief and development trial of 2007 which examined evidence of the hlfs fundraising on behalf of hamas the unitedstates government released a list of approximately 300 of hlfs unindicted coconspirators and joint venturers alamoudi was named in that list in addition to the affiliations listed above alamoudi has also been at various times a board member of american muslims for jerusalem the head of the american task force for bosnia a board member of the council for the national interest foundation a director of the council on americanislamic relations cair which by the way has very open access to the highest officials including the president they are the ones that got langley to call off a 2day seminar for law enforcement on radical islam and got the rules changed so people that were american experts on islam could not talk to any unitedstates government group about radical islam unless they got approval from people like those that cair approved of cairwe are talking also about a named coconspirator in the holy land foundation trial in which convictions were obtained for principals in the holy land foundation for supporting terrorism i would humbly submit that had eric holder not become attorney general and barack obama not become president of the united states many if not all of those coconspirators would have been then indicted and tried as supporters of terrorism instead a new president and a new attorney general came in and instead of being indicted and tried for supporting terrorism as they were named in the federal district court in dallas and the fifth circuit court of appeals said in opinionsthere was plenty of evidence to support that they were coconspiratorswell the new administration dropped the matter and these people became helpful to the administration in advising on islam it also notes that mr alamoudi was a founding trustee of the fiqh council of north america a board member of the interfaith impact for justice and peace a regional representative for the islamic society of north americawhich was also a named coconspirator for supporting terrorisma board member of mercy international president of the muslim student association of the unitedstates and canada a board member of the somali relief fund secretary of the muslim brotherhood affiliated success foundation and director of the talibah international aid association in fact in an article back in 2004 andrew c mccarthy noted that abdurahman alamoudi was sentenced today to 23 years imprisonment for terrorism financing false statements on his naturalization petition and tax violations the sentence was imposed by judge claude hilton of the unitedstates district court in alexandria virginia alamoudi was influential in the american muslim circles and thus in washington he participated in several political and charitable organizations founding the american muslim councilan enthusiastic supporter of hamas and hezbollah the federal government permitted him a key role in selecting the islamic clerics who minister in the military and in the prison system over the years moreover he occasionally traveled the globe as an emissary of the state department as we now know he also traveled to libya engaged in financial transactions with qadhafis government and collected hefty sums including the 340 000 seized from him when he was arrested last year which were designed to be routed back to his causes in the unitedstates without the knowledge of american authorities all of those activities violate the international emergency economic powers act imposes terrorismrelated sanctions prohibiting unlicensed travel to and commerce with libya i will parenthetically insert here that it had to be very convenient for mr alamoudi this convicted supporter of terrorism to be working for the state department as he went to different countries and apparently continued to conspire to support terrorism as the state department funded his travel on its behalf but also found was this article the author was brian blomquist and the date is june 27 2003 it is an article about the esteemed unitedstates senator charles or chuck schumer entitled schumer wants fanatical imams rooted out of jails armed forces the article says militant muslim imams are preaching a distorted hateful form of islam to unitedstates soldiers and federal prisoners creating a dangerous situation senator charles schumer charged yesterday schumer said the problem is that the pentagon and the federal bureau of prisons select muslim imams on the advice of islamic groups in the grip of the fanatical wahhabism strain of the religion while the potential wahhabi influence in the unitedstates armed forces is not well documented these organizations have succeeded in ensuring that militant wahhabism is the only form of islam that is preached to the 12 000 muslims in federal prison schumer said at a senate hearing on extremist wahhabi islam which has been linked to terrorism in february the new york prison system barred its top muslim chaplain from its prison facilities after the imam warith dean umar said the 9 11 hijackers should be treated as martyrs the imams flood the prisons with antiamerican probin laden videos literature and sermon tapes the point of prison should be to rehabilitate violent prisoners mr schumer is so right the article goes on the bureau of prisons uses the graduate school of islamic and social sciences which is under investigation for possible funneling of money to terrorists and the islamic society of north america which has board members with terror links schumer charged american muslim foundation president abdurahman alamoudi said his organization had no role advising the pentagon alamoudi said he formerly gave the pentagon advice on selecting imams but they pushed me out well we know that that was not until right before the british government arrested alamoudi and then provided apparently the unitedstates government plenty of evidence to show that alamoudi was supporting terrorism that is why i was so shocked since the fbi got information from britain gathered their own information that they had been gathering at least since 1991 on radical islamic beginnings here in the united states that during the bush administration the fbi would have a partnership outreach program with the council of americanislamic relations of which mr alamoudi was a board member cair was a named coconspirator for supporting terrorists which the courts have said there is plenty of evidence to support that they are while the fbi had gathered such evidence they were outreach partners with this organization cair named as a coconspirator with the holy land foundation this article from wnd pentagon admits chaplains from muslim brotherhood group published on march 6 2014 by aaron klein said the unitedstates army and air force has selected two muslim chaplains from a program run by an islamic group closely tied to the muslim brotherhood that was named by the justice department as an unindicted coconspirator in a scheme to raise money for hamas wnd broke the story in 2011 that the controversial islamic society of north america or isna is the official endorsing agency for the unitedstates armed forces muslim chaplain program wnd further reported that year that the muslim chaplain program was founded by a terrorsupporting convict while the armys first islamic chaplain who is still serving has been associated with a charity widely accused of serving as an alqaida front now isna has announced that two of its former applicants for chaplaincy were selected to serve on active duty in the united states army and air force the significance of this news is that the department of defense has not selected an isnaendorsed chaplain for active duty in over 15 years said the isna press release isna chaplain services director and islamic endorsing agent abdulrasheed muhammad said in a statement that the two chaplains selected for active duty are ready to serve allah and the countrymaking the statement in that order after speaking by phone with both soldiers it was more than clear both were eager and ready to serve allah and country may allah bless our new chaplain candidates and their families as they prepare for new challenges and opportunities in the army and air force chaplain corps said muhammad while the new chaplains ties to isna has received some attention in the conservative blogosphere in recent days missing from the conversation is the larger partnership between the unitedstates military and not just the isna but also other terrortied groups in fact muhammad himself the isnas endorsing agent has been tied to a group accused of serving as an alqaida front by the way parenthetically 1993 was the year in which we had another terrorist attack that being the first attempted bombing or the first bombing of the word trade center in an attempt to bring it down and kill tens of thousands of americans since the muslim chaplain programs inception in 1993 isna has been the official endorsing agency of the new chaplains in 2005 isna initiated a yearly muslim chaplain conference that includes leadership talks for chaplains in both the military and the unitedstates prison system discover the networks notes that isnathrough its saudigovernmentbacked affiliate the north american islamic trustreportedly holds the mortgages on 50 percent to 80 percent of all mosques in the unitedstates and canada thus the organization can freely exercise ultimate authority over these houses of worship and their teachings states discover the networks isna was founded in 1981 by the saudifunded muslim students association which was founded partially by the muslim brotherhood the two groups are still partners wnd previously attended an msa event at which violence against the unitedstates was urged by speakers we are not americans shouted one speaker muhammad faheed at queensborough community college in 2003 we are muslims the unitedstates is going to deport and attack us it is us versus them truth against falsehood the colonizers and masters against the oppressed and we will burn down the masters house well with those kind of comments coming at their meetings it is so wonderful that principles from these organizations have such close ties with the current leadership in the country in the white house in the state department and in the justice department this article goes on isna was named in a may 1991 muslim brotherhood document an explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the group in north america as one of the brotherhoods likeminded organizations of our friends who shared the common goal of destroying america and turning it into a muslim nation according to discover the networks islam scholar stephen schwartz describes isna as one of the chief conduits through which the radical saudi form of islam passes into the united states according to terrorism expert steven emerson isna is a radical group hiding under a false veneer of moderation that publishes a bimonthly magazine islamic horizons that often champions militant islamist doctrine the group also convenes annual conferences where islamist militants have been given a platform to incite violence and promote hatred states emerson emerson cites an isna conference in which alqaida supporter and plo official yusuf al qaradhawi was invited to speak emerson further reports that in september of 2002 a full year after 9 11 speakers at isnas annual conference still refused to acknowledge osama bin ladens role in the terrorist attacks also isna has held fundraisers for terrorists notes discover the networks after hamas leader mousa marzook was arrested and eventually deported in 1997 isna raised money for his defense the group also has condemned the unitedstates governments post9 11 seizure of the financial assets of hamas and palestinian islamic jihad isna meanwhile has an extensive relationship with the obama administration which recently announced it is open to diplomacy with the muslim brotherhood this is where i have to say having visited with leaders in the middle east muslim leaders who are actually friends of the united states not in official open meetings but when we get in private they ask the question why does your unitedstates administration continue to support the muslim brotherhood do you not understand the muslim brotherhood has been at war with the united states since 1979 and you have got friendly muslims that want to help youi would submit that the current president of egypt is one of thoseand yet you are insistent on helping the muslim brotherhood that is at war with the united states oh not with violence yet but they claim they are getting so much accomplished in taking over the united states without violence that they dont want to use that yet that will come later if necessary but right now they are doing such a good job as advisers and in important positions in the administration that they should not be using violence well back to the article the relationship began even before obama took office one week before last years presidential inauguration again keeping in mind this article is from 2014 one week before last years presidential inauguration sayyid syeed national director of isnas office for interfaith and community alliances was part of a delegation that met with the directors of obamas transition team the delegation discussed a request for an executive order ending torture isna president mattson represented american muslims at obamas inauguration where she offered a prayer during the televised event mattson also represented isna at obamas ramadan dinner at the white house in june 2009 obama senior aide valerie jarrett invited mattson to work on the white house council on women and girls which jarrett leads yeah that is what you want you want someone who supports the muslim brotherhoods idea that women dont have rights they have no business showing their face in public or driving or having property yeah that is what you want advising the white house on womens issues for heavens sake the article goes on one month later the justice department sponsored an information booth at an isna bazaar in washington d c also that month jarrett addressed isnas 46th annual convention according to the white house jarrett attended as part of obamas outreach to muslims in february obamas top adviser on counterterrorism john brennan came under fire for controversial remarks he made in a speech to muslim law students at an event sponsored by isna at new york university in his speech brennan who later became cia director stated that having a percentage of terrorists released by the unitedstates return to terrorist attacks isnt that bad since the recidivism rate for inmates in the unitedstates prison system is higher he also criticized parts of the bush administrations response to 9 11 as a reaction some people might say was over the top in some areas that in an overabundance of caution we implemented a number of security measures and activities that upon reflection now we look back after the heat of the battle has died down a bit we say they were excessive ok wnd reported brennan stated at the isnaorganized event that the obama administration is working to calibrate policies in the fight against terrorism that ensure americans are never profiled speaking at the questionandanswer session brennan declared himself a citizen of the world we need to be looking at ourselves as individuals not the way we look or the creed we have or our ethnic background i consider myself a citizen of the world he said brennan told the audience the obama administration is trying to make sure that we as americans can interact in a safe way balance policies in a way that optimizes national security but also optimizes the opportunity in this country never to be profiled never to be discriminated against yes that is right sure if you hate america and you want americas western lifestyle and freedoms destroyed you want women subjugated we shouldnt profile people just because they want america destroyed as part of their religious beliefs that kind of thinking gets a nation in trouble and thus we are in trouble this article was published this week january 5 2016 from jennifer hickey ripe for radicalization federal prisons breeding ground for terrorists say experts here we are in 2016 substantiating the statements that senator chuck schumer made back in 2003 that our prisons have been for years now a breeding ground for radical islamism under both republican and democratic administrations we have allowed people who have been namedand for which the federal courts have said there is plenty of evidence to support that they are coconspirators in financing terrorism and supporting terrorismwe have allowed them to pick imams approve imams put imams in our military and in our prisons is it any surprise that 13 years after chuck schumer raised that issue that since nothing has been done about it that the federal prisons are a breeding ground for radical islamists this quote from representative stephen fincher my friend from tennessee says over the years our federal prisons have become a breeding ground for radicalization that is supportive of what chuck schumer said years ago in fact this article by carol brown december 5 2014 american thinker com prisons are breeding grounds for jihadist muslims comprise 15 of the prison population this number far exceeds the percentage of muslims in the general population it is eighteen times greater to be exact so there are 18 times more muslims in federal prison than the percentage of muslims in the general population that raises issues questions and problems put another way there are about 2 4 million muslims in the united states and 350 000 of them are in jail that means more than 12 of muslims in america are incarcerated reports on the number of prisoners who convert to islam vary and are framed in different ways some sources estimate 40 000 prisoners per year convert others put the numbers closer to 135 000 per year some posit that 80 of inmates who find faith while in prison convert to islam one thing is for sure the majority of those who convert to islam in prison are black with as many as one in three black prisoners converting the number of hispanic prisoners converting to islam is also on the rise these numbers are staggering and the implications are serious as will be addressed further on in this article there are numerous reasons why conversions to islam are skyrocketing in our jails many prisoners feel angry disenfranchised and yes even victimized and wronged by society many harbor a deep disdain for america they are therefore prime targets for recruitment to a religious ideology that shares many of these attitudes in addition islamic teachings are often framed as a noble code of ethics to live by case in point the nation of islam is the largest prison ministry i am sure they are meaning the largest prison ministry in the united states this is going on as i speak it has been going on for the 13 years since chuck schumer brought it up in the senate and we dont appear to have learned any lessons from this my friend dana rohrabacher is pushing that we invite the president of egypt president elsisi to come speak to a joint session of congress i was talking to chairman royce about it he believes it would be a good idea our majority whip steve scalise just met with president elsisi in egypt i am thrilled he did he is a muslim leader who understands the muslim brotherhood is a threat to freedom in egypt and in america and in europe it is time we did something about it to protect ourselves you dont have to profile muslims but you should be profiling those who are studying radical islam like qutb like in his booklet milestones which osama bin laden said radicalized himor helped yet this administration will not allow our justice department our intelligence departments and agencies and our state department to be educated on radical islam so of course you are going to be admitting a woman who takes a mans name that denotes a terrorist islamic jihadist from hundreds of years ago tashfeen malik our homeland security has run off people who are real patriots like phil haney and who are brilliant on the issue of radical islam we have run them out the message is clear that you had better not study radical islam and you had better not know anything about radical islam in homeland security because if you do we will run you off if we dont do something worse thank god phil haney had such a clean record they were looking for anything our country is in trouble and there are people who want to destroy it it is ridiculous that anybody still has to say we know all muslims are not terrorists of course they are not but it is ridiculous to continue to allow and to even encourage radical islamist imams in our prisons to transform prisoners into additional radical jihadists who are going to go off like bombs figuratively and literally at some point down the road we also have to look at our immigration policy when it comes to continuing to allow people like alamoudiwho hates america who considers himself to be a person who could help bring about the global caliphate a person who is financing terrorismhave his wife come and have a child in america before he started trying to radicalize that country and take power unto himself as if he were a dictator morsis wifemorsi the former president of egypthad a child here do you think that child was being brought up to love america do you think alamoudis child was being raised to love america while his parents were scheming to terrorize it anwar alawlaki is one about whom my friends on both sides of the aisle have discussed the proprieties or improprieties of having a president just issue an order to kill an american citizen anwar alawlaki a man who led staffers in muslim prayers right here on capitol hill capitol hill staffers were led in prayer by a man who ultimately the obama administrationthe president himselfconsidered to be so dangerous he had to take him out with a drone strike in yemen he was so dangerous to the united states that we couldnt even risk arresting him later he had to take him out with a bomb strike how was he an american citizen his parents who raised him to hate america came to america on student visas they studied here and had anwar alawlaki they took him back to yemen and taught him to hate america he became so dangerous that even president obama felt he had to order a strike on an american citizen without his having had a trial without due process he felt he had to take him out with a drone because that american citizenan american citizen only because his parents came here on visaswas too dangerous for them to do anything else it is time we started protecting our homeland and we need an administration that will do it in closing let me just add that the reports have been that the obama administration used the nsa to spy on members of congress to help it keep the iran treaty in play we have got to get to the bottom of that if it turns out that our president was unconstitutionally spying on members of congress i do not care if they were all democrats or republicans i do not care they may have been democrats it doesnt matter if he were spying on members of congressusing the nsa or any other government agency to spy on members of congresswe need to find out if it happened if he were he needs to be removed from office period otherwise we cant save the nation i hope and pray those allegations are not true i hope and pray that the president of the united states did not have the nsa spying on members of congress to help him with the iran deal to help him as he was supporting the biggest supporters of terrorism in the world i hope and pray that is not true i hope and pray it is not but we need to find out i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9885563850402832, 0.9885563850402832, 0, "house resolution 19 provides for the consideration of two important pieces of legislation to help the american economy both of which passed in the 113th congress with bipartisan support h r 30 the save american workers act is designed to address a critical flaw in the affordable care act which is causing workers to lose hours at their jobs and thus lose wagesthose wages that help put food on their tables those wages that help feed their families pay their utility bills heat their homes during the winter and cool their homes during the summer h r 30 fixes this flaw by changing the newly created labor rule in the affordable care act which defines fulltime work at 30 hours a week and places that definition back where the american public has believed it to be for the last 100 years that is at 40 hours the second bill contained in todays rule is h r 3 the keystone xl pipeline act and that would put an end to what has been a 6year process for approving a pipeline that should have simply been common sense for americas economy a long time ago the rule before us today provides for 1 hour of debate for each of the bills this allows the house to fully debate these crucial issues these bills are targeted pieces of legislation dealing with one single provision in the affordable care act and one single pipeline respectively no one is trying to repeal the affordable care act today for that stay tuned but i have no doubt that members of the minority will claim that this bill is an attempt to repeal the affordable care act but in fact it simply makes changes to a definition and interpretation by the department of labor in the bill as always the minority is also afforded the customary motion to recommit on each of the bills as a result of the affordable care acts requirement that businesses with 50 or more employees provide health insurance coverage to those employees working 30 hours per week employers across the nationfrom schools to universities to municipalities to restaurantsare being forced to cut workers hours or face unsustainable employment costs to their businesses and to their organizations as a result we are seeingand this is what republicans predicted prior to the controversial and contentious passage of the affordable care actbut what we are seeing is the bill has fundamentally changed labor law in this country creating a new standard 30hour workweek as a result workers hours are being cut and productivity in this countrya country that has always prided itself on the work ethic of its citizenswill decrease over time this is what onerous government regulations dosuppress innovation and hamper businesses many members of the democratic party have been outspoken in clamoring for an extension to longterm unemployment benefits which would extend government assistance to all unemployed americans well beyond a years worth of benefits yet there is something that can be done now there is something that can be done today which will have an actual practical effect of putting more money in more peoples pockets we have heard story after story from every state in the union that employers are dropping workers hours from less than 39 hours a week to perhaps less than 29 hours or fewerpotentially 10 work hours a week that workers wont see in their paychecks which could mean hundreds of dollars that men and women wont have to feed their families and pay their bills increasing workers hours increases money that people have to spend the affordable care act fundamentally changed labor law in this country and the repercussions of this may not be felt for years to come this is a dangerous slippery slope what other labor laws will be reinterpreted now to define fulltime employment as 30 hours per week do people intend to impose overtime rules on employers who employ people for over 30 hours per week this is yet another regulation which would only result in businesses cutting more hours what will the national labor relations board reinterpret knowing that the very fabric of labor law is now based on a 30hour workweek instead of the 100year standard of the 40hour workweek prior to the affordable care act employers were already overwhelmingly providing health insurance to their employees working 40 hours per week making the change contained in mr youngs legislation will cause the least amount of disruption to the labor market and that is an important thing the congressional budget office estimates that the affordable care act will reduce the total number of hours worked on net by about 1 5 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024 almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor because of this the congressional budget office projects a decline in the number of workers of about 2 million in 2017 rising to 2 5 million in 2024 as a result of the affordable care act the latest congressional budget office figures show that the affordable care act will increase spending by almost 2 trillion double the estimate from 5 years ago and the joint committee on taxation says that taxpayers will be on the hook for over another 1 trillion over the next decade americans earning as little as 25 000 annually will pay

it is a way to transport oil than other means namely with trucks trains and ships this is common sense the issue has been debated here in the house i dont know how many times over the past several years enough is enough it is time to approve this application and put men and women to work who will be building this pipeline let us be clear about what is happening today we are not repealing the affordable care act we are not undermining the affordable care act the bill does not take health insurance from a single person in this country it is a fix to a fatal flaw in the legislation a fix similar to the seven other fixes that have passed both houses of congress and in fact been signed by the president it is similar to the 37 unilateral fixes that the president and his secretary of health and human services have made on their own this is a fix to stop this legislation from resulting in people losing work if democrats cant agree to fix a provision in the affordable care act that is preventing people from working then it is simply empty rhetoric to claim that they are interested in any fixes at all i will encourage my colleagues to vote yes on the rule and yes on the

yet earlier this week the administration was quick to boast about announcing the deficit being down that low when we asked in the past what is the plan mr president for balancing the budget ever not

have got a few that are bad apples we have got to give the tools necessary to the leadership within the administration to do what is right and if necessary allow them latitude to let those people go we voted on a similar bill years ago before i got into congress we gave this right and authority we gave it to the irs guess what the irs has the best tax compliance in all federal governmentwho would have thought i was pleased to see that congressman steny hoyer voted for that piece of legislation that congressman elijah cummings voted for that legislation we want to take that same power that same right that we gave the irs years ago because it workedit workedand we want to give that to the other departments and agencies now there are a lot of exceptions there are a lot of ways to get out of this but the basic principle is true one federal workers do a better job of paying their taxes than the general public and we should pat them on the back and we should recognize them for that but two when you do have a few bad apples you have got to allow leadership the ability to let those people go if they continue to thumb their nose at the system and the taxpayers we just heard testimony from the dea i cant fire anybody even though they were engaged in some very nefarious activity we heard the administrator of the epa say i cant let anybody go even though the person is watching 4 hours of porn a day four hours a day they couldnt fire them lets give them some latitude because we have a test case it has worked we want tax compliance the presidents fiscal year 2016 budget asks american taxpayers to spend 275 billion to pay federal workers an average salary of more than 78 000 yet the irs reports that more than 100 000 federal civilian employees owed more than 1 billion in unpaid federal income taxes in 2014more than 1 billion now there are lots of reasons people cant do that there are people who need to have their wages garnished and they are there are people who are disputing what the irs said again this bill doesnt affect those people the adjudication process continues on and this bill doesnt affect those people as a last resort we need a tool that the irs has for its employees we need that tool for the other departments and agencies because like it or not the law requires that we pay taxes five years ago president obama directed his administration to crack down on tax cheats it was specifically targeting and discussing contractors but i would argue that the same principle for contractors should be in place for federal employees how can you look the contractors and the employees in the eyes and say well we have got two totally different standards of principles the principle is the samepay your taxes and there is not a problem if you are in trouble and if you are trying to get out of it not a problem we will work with you yet for those of you who are just screwing over the american taxpayer byebye you cant even apply the president said all across this country there are people who meet their obligations each and every day you do your jobs you support your families you pay the taxes you owebecause its a fundamental responsibility of citizenship i totally and wholeheartedly agree the federal employee tax accountability act makes individuals with seriously delinquent tax debt ineligible for federal employment it is defined as an outstanding federal tax debt that has been assessed and may be collected by levy or court proceeding the legislation does not affect employees who are working to settle their tax disputes or resolving outstanding liabilities i want to also remind everybody that the committee and i as the prime sponsor accepted every democrat amendment that was offered100 percent several other safeguards are carved out in the bill including provisions offered by the minority in the previous congresses individuals are provided full due process rights and have an additional 180 days to demonstrate their debts meet one of the exemptions of the bill that was i believe offered by congressman lynch we accepted it we thought we would get broader support because of it and we would hope we would today the bill also provides a financial hardship exemption if the individuals service is in the best interest of the united states the person who is leading that department or agency still has discretion if he says it is in the best interest in my judgment for the united states to continue to have this person serve he is allowed to continue to serve the bill demonstrates a simple principle individuals collecting federal salaries funded by taxpayers have to follow the rules and pay their taxes those charged with the stewardship of our federal resources and programs should not be delinquent in their taxes as all americans file their taxes today so should federal employees and most of them doin fact at better rates than civilians do last month in testimony before the committee the gao warned congress of tens of thousands of federal employees who were eligible for security clearances but who still had unpaid tax debts i would argue that that is a potential security risk it shows a vulnerability during the hearing members discussed the irs employees high rate of tax compliance from 2009 to 2013 irs employees had a 0 8 percent delinquency rate compared to 3 3 percent for civilian workers throughout
