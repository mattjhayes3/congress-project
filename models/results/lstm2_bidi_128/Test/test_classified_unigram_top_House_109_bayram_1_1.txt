am a bit breathless because i hustled over here to arrive at the appointed time and i thank my colleagues hopefully they filibustered a few minutes on my behalf as good friends likely would i would like to speak to you about a few issues about border control especially on the southern border and primarily on the southern border i have long spoken about the policy that i think we need to have with regard to the immigration policy across the nation about domestic enforcement and shutting off the jobs magnet and also about the need to stop the bleeding at our southern border and so i had gone down to the border about a year ago and spent a long weekend down there at least 3 days on the ground and in the air as a guest of the border patrol hnd some of the other agencies that operate the security along the border and i was given a very good tour and a few rides in helicopters at night and also in the daytime shining the night sun down along our bbrder to identify where there might be illegals that have come across or future illegals preparing to come across and i stopped and visited some of the stations and their equipment and talked to the men i was impressed with the quality of the team people that they had assembled the equipment they had assembled and the tactics they had yet in that full long weekend i did not actually see activity which would indicate to a reasonable person that there was not activity to be seen in spite all of those hours in the air and the hours on the ground and the night vision equipment i did not again see any illegal activities although i got many reports of the success of the interdictionof our border patrol and our other agencies well as i listen to the debate here in the house of representatives and the testimony that comes before the immigration subcommittee which i sit upon and i sit in those hearings two three even four times a week and we will have four sometimes eight witnesses giving us credible data and good wellinformed information on this issue from both sides of the issue and always the years the cumulative information has built in me after those years of sitting on the immigration subcommittee i began to think that i have a pretty decent broad background on the subject and yet there was a gap there was a gap in that subject because i had not gone down and spent time on the border more or less unguided moreor less outside the scope of the border patrol but gone ahead and gone down to the border and looked under all the stones and met with the people that were actually more likely to be more frank with me so that was my mission this past weekend where i spent perhaps as much as 4 days on the ground in arizona and the goal was to meet with the people that are enforcing our laws down there the ones that are out in the night and those people who have seen this bleeding this hemorrhaging at our border firsthand that can describe to me the scope of the bleeding in our southern border i am here to say tonight that it is astonishing it is far worse than i had imagined and my imagination was fairly strong my predictions and the numbers that i put out were fairly aggressive at least viewed by some of my critics but there is nothing i saw down on the border over the weekend that would cause me to believe that i have overstated the numbers of people who are illegally crossing our border or the amount of drugs illegal drugs that are coming across our border or the amount of violence that is visited because of the drug problem both south of the border north of the border and the violence that goes throughout the drug culture in america and the collateral damage to the victims that may not be associate with that at all but happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are victims of murder victims of negligent homicide generally in the form of a car accident where the driver who was at fault was under the influence of alcohol or drugs so what i did was go down to visit in a region starting out on friday in a region south of tucson south and a little bit east of tucson i first met with a special agent who briefed me on a lot of information that had been coming by this individual on a consistent basis and then i went to bisbee arizona where i went on down then to the border there to naco arizona right on the border with mexico that is a location that has seen a fair amount of violence and a lot of concentration of illegal traffic going along the border they finaljy decided to establish and build a fence i was guided to that location by a retired border patrol officer and a rancher from that region both with a passion of patriotism for america both that have a memory of growing up in an america and that part of arizona that was a different kind of country than it is today it was then a place that they could feel safe in their streets and safe in their homes and walk the streets and not lock their homes and today that region has been flooded with just thousands and tens of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of illegals many of them carrying illegal drugs through that region and cars drive across the border where sometimes there had been an existing fence that was built originally to contain livestock that fence has essentially been systematically broken down and vehicles with drugs and illegals in them would drive right through the gaps in the fence sometimes drive through the fence and take off across the desert or cut across over to a highway and get up on the highway and once they were on the highway for a little ways they were gone they were free they were in america not ever to be captured again not ever to be accountable again unless they were just simply victims of bad luck they realized the magnitude of this problem at naco arizona and went in and built a fence through there it is built out of interlocking steel that sometimes ean be 10 feet high or higher and then above that in some cases they have welded a kind of wire mesh that goes up another 4 to 6 feet and when they originally built the fence people said it would not work it cannot work people will go over it they will go through they will go under it or they will go around it in fact they do go around it at one point they picked up a cutting torch and cut a hole through it and made their own gate in that solid steel fence and that was a pathway by which people and drugs traveled into the united states and some went back through that gate and the patrol went there and welded the gate shut and as they kept some maintenance up on the fence the other side essentially gave up on trying to breech the fence 2230 now the illegal traffic goes around the end as one reason rather than trying to find a way through a barrier that is a good solid barrier that has been very very effective the border patrol officer whom i was there with and the rancher whom i was there with said look at this and they described the problem they used to have about the thousands of people pouring across there they said we do not have that problem anymore this community is safer than it was it is more secure than it was there is far less illegal traffic going through here there is far less crime of all kinds far less violence and far fewer illegal drugs in this community brecause we built a barrier that kept the elements out that were eroding our quality of life in naco arizona that was an interesting trip and they took me out along the border where that fence essentially stops and diminishes in some locations there is nothing there not even a way to define where the border is between the united states and mexico but simply open places where illegals can walk across the border and one location just in a dry river bed or they would not be seen by night vision they were protected by the shrubbery and vegetation they could simply walk down from mexico into the united states unimpeded unobstructed unobserved and become shadow people here in the united states doing whatever they do they were strong advocates of the border barrier and one that is solidly built and one that can be efficient and is becoming a tool that could very much support our law enforcement and let them focus their energy on plans that could be more effective than riding herd on a broad length of an unprotected border it is ridiculous to think that we could ever hire enough people to sit along the border especially at night and watch people come across and then catch them rather than put in a fence that would not allow them to come across in the first place that was naco arizona and again i learned a lot about the culture and the level of corruption on the south side of the border it was an interesting conversation from there i went down then to the reservation and was a guest of a number of the shadow wolves who are part of the customs and border patrol actually today they are a part of the border patrol they have been shifted to that but it is on the tohono oodham reservation and on the reservation the native americans control that land they have support of the border patrol but they have had an organization there called the shadow wolves they are federal employees and their responsibility is to guard the border and interdict illegal drugs and illegal aliens they are focusing on illegal drugs their peak recruitment the top numbers there were 22 and when they were 22 strong in fact that does not sound like a very large group given the size of the reservation and given the miles of border that they have to protect and i believe that number is 76 miles of border protected and controlled by 22 shadow wolves members of the tohono oodham tribe on the reservation but those 22 in the period of a year i have got to dig up the statistics so i will be able to release those and publish those but the information i received that they had intefdicted more illegal drugs in a 12month period of time with 22 of their shadow wolves than all 2 000 border patrol agents did in that entire sector for the same period of time that is an extraordinary example of effectiveness and efficiency and it is the kind of thing that we here in this congress need to endorse and support and encourage and fund and authorize and protect and encourage and enhance do all of things that we can do to identify the best among us to encourage them to grow that gulture off beyond the bounds of the reservation take that same culture of efficiency and enforcement on to the other reservations whether native american tribes that control land on our national boundaries with our neighbors and the level of success that has been there has not been rewarded it has not been encouraged it has not been enhanced by the border patrol who seems to want to be seeking to undermine their efforts and absorb them into the broader border patrol in which case if they did that the shadow wolves would lose their identity these people have an extraordinary amount of character and courage and conviction and pride in what they do but like anyone if they do not see a reward for that if they do not see some kindof encouragement if they do not understand that here in congress we are supporting them eventually they will be assimilated into the border patrol and their level of efficiency will be assimilated into the broader overall level of efficiency in the border patrol now i do not mean to imply that the border patrol is not efficient or that they may not have the kind of personnel that i would like to see in fact they have some very extraordinarily brave noble hardworking officers and many of them the structure has become big and it has become difficult to be efficient so i am not here to discourage them i am here to encourage them and i often shake their hands and thank them for what they do because they are the last line of defense along our border to protect us from the incursions of millions that take place in this country every single night but what i saw from the shadow wolves was not ohly some of the history in their legacy and their efficiency and effectiveness but i went out in the field with them and watched the way that they follow the border when they see that there has been a border crossing there they will pick up that sound that track if you will and they will follow that track down and hunt down the illegals sometimes they are carrying backpacks of illegal drugs sometimes they are just people entering the united states illegally but they will find that track and get on a trot and follow that track and trace them to where they are pick them up and detain them and then process them in a fashion in accordance with law again their effort has been extraordinary in some of the things that they showed and taught me too much to go in depth here on the floor of the house of representatives but quite a lot of extraordinary skill that appears to me would be very constructive if it could be passed along to other agencies out there particularly the broader border patrol but the culture is there as well as more important the skills to protect the culture of the shadow wolves it is extraordinary i was impressed with what they do and i intend to support and encourage and enhance them i will be looking for a way legislatively to demonstrate my commitment to their commitment to protect our border and defend us against the illegal incursions into the united states and the thousands and thousands of pounds of illegal drugs that come across ourborder every single day many of them still pouring through the tohono oodham reservation and in spite of the best efforts of the nowshrunken shadow wolves down from 22 to 16 to cover those 76 miles of border fence so again i have been extraordinarily impressed but they have done their job from there i traveled outside the reservation and went over then jo the cabeza prieta national wildlife refuge and met with some people there some national parks people and department of the interior forest rangers seventyfive percent of their work which they signed up to do would be to protect our natural resources preserve our parks enhance our parks let mother nature be enhanced there so that the visiting public could come into these locations like the cabeza prieta national refuge and be able to appreciate mother nature in its purest form that is why our forest rangers and our park officers got into the business because they appreciate wildlife they appreciate our plant life they appreciate how the species of nature have balanced in these regions and how they have grown and they try to enhance that they find that 75 percent of their time their border patrol officers even 75 percent of their time is spent protecting the border 75 percent of the time keeping illegals and illegal drugs out of the park not a successful effort i might add and perhaps a futile effort but an effort that needs to be attempted nonetheless with dozens and dozens of abandoned vehicles sitting out across the national wildlife refuge vehicles that have blazed a trail through there and hundreds of miles of roads have been carved through that national wildlife refuge because that was the most expeditious route for smugglers to drive their suburbans and their 4wheel drive pickups and you name your vehicle there and there will be somebody else behind you and the next night another and another and another that formerly pristine desert turns into sometimes a 200foot wide path after it has been pounded in the desert with traffic enough times it turns into what they call moon dust just loose dust that lays there in ruts in a way that you can get stuck in that dust 200 feet wide perhaps before this was a few less than 10 years ago in fact starting about 1998 was when these border incursions began and when they began to create these roads and these trails and tear up our natural resources the people that are dying in an attempt to get across the desert have gone from a couple of years ago or 3 years ago 150 175 a year now across our southern border as many as 450 a year do not make it across the desert when they seek to walk into the united states they die of hypothermia they die of exposure they die of dehydration more dehydration than anything else the desert is not very forgiving and some of them are not very well prepared they are not very wellguided and that human tragedy is exacerbated by the damage to our natural resources which i had a i will say less than enhanced appreciation for i really learned to respect and appreciate the work that is done by our department of the interior as well as the value of the resources that they are seeking to protect a case in point i think illustrates this better than anything else would be a rare species of a bat a long nose bat and this is an endangered species it only lives and reproduces in four caves and those caves are all down in that region one of those caves was a cave that was frequented consistently by the illegals who would go up into the region and then their guide and their track would take them to this cave where the baby bats were born they began taking a stop off and temporary residence in the cave to the point where they scared the bats off and they would not come back in the long nose bat the lesser long nose bat left the cave would not come back to reproduce and so our national park service looked at that situation said we have to protect this resource and if this happens in the other three caves there will be no place for these bats to reproduce who knows if they will become extinct so they put up a wrought iron fence around the opening to this cave cost 75 000 and there is other labor that was not tallied in put the wrought iron fence around the cave and it was built in way to keep the illegals out of the cave fortunately tile lesser long nose bats returned to the cave and they are in there now living there and reproducing but think about it for a moment if you would the effect of building a fence just around the entrance of the cave that provided a deterrent that allowed the bats to come back and live there again and reproduce and fly out and they are really essential they are essential then to the pollination of certain cactus ou there in the desert without which the cactus would not survive it has a whole set of chain reactions i am submitting that we build a fence on the border because it is a lot cheaper to do than it is to build a fence around everything that is threatened from the illegals and the drug trade that comes from our southern border that was the lesson there at the cabeza prieta national wildlife refuge that being a second stop or actually a third stop along the way and then from there i went on over to organ pipe national cactus monument organ pipe is another national monument location and that is the location where the national park service officer his name was chris eggle was killed in a shootout with drug lords near the mexican border in the park property i went there with his father bob i visited the location where the shooting took place where he stood where the shooter laid where he fell where there is a monument there today that was built and placed by his father bob and his mother bonnie well they brought stones from their farm in michigan down to place around the monument and there is a cross and a picture and a place to remember where this happened where it happened that chris was killed by a drug lord or at least an employee of a drug lord who had driven across the mexican border where there was no barrier when he was being under hot pursuit by the mexican police and his vehicle broke down and collapsed and stopped across the border into the united states and chris eggle and his partner were called in on that scene as they split up and converged on the location where the drug smuggler was chris was ambushed with an ak47 that had been brought into the united states illegal of course on a vehicle that was illegal with drugs that were illegal across a border that was undefined let alone defined with a barrier e 2245 had there been a vehicle barrier there had there been a fence there chris eggle would be alive today he is not there is a memorial there at the organ pipe cactus national monument that memorializes him as well i talked to many of his coworkers that were there his spirit is alive and his spirit is strong today the happy chris eggle is the one that is remembered although he is not with us his spirit is with us and his sacrifice is something we need to remember he is not the only one he is not the first one i pray he will be the last one but i saw nothing down there that would indicate to me that he will be the last one that tragedy taught them something at organ pipe after the tragedy of chris death at the hands of the drug runner whom the mexicans were chasing into the united states and by the way that drug runner was subsequently shot and killed by the mexican police department he was in the united states and shot from their side of the border that is not an issue with me but as a matter of full disclosure i point that out the lesson learned from that was to close the border at least shut off the vehicle traffic so they have built a vehicle barrier along organ pipe and it is most of the way along the organ pipe national monument it is perhaps 32 miles altogether as i look at that and travel along the side of that border it is built so that steel posts full of concrete set in the ground and then it has got horizontal barriers about two of those one about eye height and one about halfway up designed so that vehicles cant drive through it but the desert pronghorn can run through it and jackrabbits can run through it and any kind of wildlife can go back and forth through there they had trouble with cattle moving in from mexico so they stretched a couple of barbed wires in there to keep the cattle on the mexican side of course those barbed wires were cut because the people who were jumping the border thought it was an obstruction to have to climb over one barbed wire so they cut the fence we drove through and picked a place where the illegal traffic was going across and they were demonstrating how that tracking takes place as they did with the shadow wolves on their reservation what i saw in a number of places it got to where you could pick it out easily every night traffic coming into the national monument and paths that are beaten so smooth one of the officers said well one day well shut off this illegal traffic and it will be a nice path for citizens to come down here and visit our park because it is already smoothed out it is kind of graded out by all the foot traffic in fact in one of those locations the traffic goes across the fence and right by a sign and the sign says do not enterinto the united states this is a dangerous place the sun is hot you can die in the desert there h2327 isnt water for you there are snakes there are scorpions its dangerous turn back cynically the path goes right by the sign the sign is in spanish if they can read they can read that but in a way i think it is cynically they go by that sign just to send us a message fiftyeight percent of mexicans believe they have a right to come to the united states they are utterly wrong but we need to convey that message to them so that they can understand that the united states needs to be committed to enforcing our borders the incidents that happened down there illustrate what i saw first the argument as i asked the officers retired border patrol or current officers who were at the point of retiring or quitting and giving up those were the kind of people that would talk to me they were the people that would open up to me one of them was an officer at a station no one would talk to me because the orders were you dont speak to a member of congress you dont talk to anybody from government your job is to do your job but not to tell anyone what that job is what the statistics are in your area so they sent me to an individual there who is near retirement and that individual was willing to speak in fact numbers of those individuals were willing to speak with me some ready to quit some ready to retire some retired they would talk to me straight up and open they didnt care about the consequences for that they care about this country they care about our border security and our border control and they understand that you cantbe a nation if you dont have a border you cant call it a border if you dont defend your border i hear the testimony here in congress as the border patrol testifies before the immigration subcommittee and consistently it is we stop 25 to 331 3 percent of the illegals that are traveling across our border i have used that number consistently in my remarks across this country and i ask that question of the people that are down there in the line on the line defending our national security and i would say what percentage do you stop where do you stand they would hesitate in their answer and i would say 25 to 33 percent do you stop a fourth do you stop a third how many do you stop they would laugh and give me a number one of them burst out in hysterical laughter when i submitted that they could be successful in stopping 25 percent of the illegal traffic he responded back to me no its more like 3 percent of the illegal traffic of the illegals coming into the united states do we stop and perhaps 5 percent of the illegal drugs its not 25 percent its not 33 percent in fact its not 10 percent but of the informed answers that i got down there and i asked it at every stop the informed answers that i got i never got an informed answer above 10 percent of anybody that was involved in actual protection of the border and processing people that were coming through that border ten percent now think about it for a moment 10 percent last year we apprehended about 1 188 000 illegal entrants into the united states on our southern border on that 2 000mile run 1 188 000 if that number is correct on 10 percent if you move that decimal point one over that is 11 880 000 attempts to cross the border you can take perhaps a couple of million off that if you wanted to be generous and take it down to 10 million succeeded i dont think actually 10 million succeeded coming into the united states but i do think the number is far higher than the numbers that we are working with in the media today we have used the number here 11 million illegals in america we used the number for 3 years while 4 million people a year at least were coming across the border maybe a lot more than that and over 3 years the number didnt accumulate but about 500 000 a year even less so after 3 years we finally raised the number to 12 million but no one now pays attention to that we are still back stuck in that 11 million mode of illegals in america that number is far higher than 11 million maybe we are successful in stopping 10 percent maybe the individual who advised me that 3 percent of illegals and 5 percent of the illegal drugs maybe he was off by a factor of oh lets say two maybe it is 6 percent of the illegals and 10 percent of the illegal drugs however you measure this it is astonishing in its magnitude in the cost to this country in fact we are headed down a path it wont be very much longer that everyone who wants to come to the united states will be here the message was sent january 6 2004 when our esteemed commander in chief gave a speech it is called in america the amnesty speech it was the one that said here is the pplicy that we want to have it is one of a guest worker temporary worker as the only solution if you have too many illegals in america i suppose the quickest and cheapest and the most guaranteed solution one could have is simply legalize them all give them all amnesty give them a path to citizenship voila no problem we have fixed the problem because we have legalized them all by a version of amnesty the american people reject amnesty in this country they understand that we have to have a rule of law that citizenship must be precious that you must respect the rule of law there is more to being an american than having somebody stamp automatic citizenship on your green card or on your matricular consular card there is more to being an american than that being an american is rooted in and based upon a common culture an understanding and a common sense of experience and history of reverence and respect for our borders for the sovereignty of the united states of america for the destiny of this country for the assimilation that has made us so great that have been able to take immigrants in from all over the world bring them into this great giant melting pot of america give them this opportunity and let them reach out and earn and succeed in this opportunity for success the legal immigrants in america have performed extraordinarily well in fact the vigor that they bring to our society and our economy surpasses much of the vigor that we find in the nativeborn americans that are here all of us in this congress support a rational immigration policy that is designed to enhance the economic social and cultural wellbeing of america but if we have an open borders policy and the people that advocate for an open borders policy are really advocating for an unlimited amount of immigration everyone who might want to come here to the united states could come here and if all 6 billion people on the planet want to arrive here in the same year that is fine with them they dont take a stand that there is such a thing as too much immigration even too much illegal immigration they will not stand in the way of one of them they will not stand up and say the best thing you can do for your country is to stay in your country grow its economy be part of the solution bring reform to the governments of places like mexico and points south places that are so utterly corrupt that the economy is strangled places that are so corrupt that there has to be pro tection paid at every stop along the way that you cant get a birth certification when you are born in a country unless you happen to be born into a family that has the connections and maybe is willing to pay the kind of funds to pay off the madrina network that is there so that you can get your birth certificate and somebody identify who you are and be able to move around in this society or that society the level of corruption is astonishing it runs deep i would add to this that in spite of all the statistics that i could tell you in fact i will go to some of those statistics in a moment but first i would like to recount a few incidents that really bring home the circumstances and reality as i was there on the tohono oodham reservation with the shadow wolves there was a drug smuggler who was pulled over and stopped we were out in the desert tracking some illegals and getting a feel for how that worked and excellently being guided while this was on there was a call to an emergency and a number of the shadow wolves mobilized and they called in a black hawk helicopter that was there to aerially observe a vehicle that may 9 2006 co was escaping from the ground people they followed the vehicle and got it trapped up into a deadend road and the driver took off and ran and they followed him and finally apprehended him they brought him and the pickup the small truck as i would say to some of my other friends in america into the compound there where the shadow wolves headquarters is and looked the vehicle over it looked like it had been reworked that they had taken it through a body shop and created a false floor underneath the bed of that pickup the bed itself had a plastic liner in it so you couldnt see the bodywork that had been done we looked that over and they pointed out to me how that work was done it was done in a chopshop in mexico once they got the clearance to go ahead and search the truck they went in with the jaws of life and peeled the bed of that vehicle up and apart in there we carried out 18 large bales of marijuana about 10 pounds or more per bale at least 180 pounds of marijuana lying underneath that 6 to 8inch false floor of that vehicle the alleged perpetrator and i did lay eyes on him and evaluated him i guess for my own perspective he had a 13 tattooed on his arm many other tattoos all over his chest and arms it was clear to the people there that he was ms13 mara salxatrucha 13 the most dangerous gang that we have ever seen in this continent that dangerous gang of course is smuggling drugs up into the united states they had collared one of their members one of their perpetrators who was then in that holding cell i was there to help unload the drugs from the pickup there to observe this entire process there recorded and there to burn it into my memory that we think of a large quantity of drugs where i come from it night be oh perhaps a few pounds occasionally we get larger loads coming up through iowa of course but when somebody says a lot of illegal drugs we are thinking of a quantity substantially smaller than 180 pounds they think of 180 pounds or 200 pounds of illegal marijuana as a decoy a decoy that might be designed to draw the law enforcement down another path so that when the path clears when all the law enforcement pounces on the decoy then the larger loads can come through the 1 000 pounds the 2 600pound loads the full semi loads can start up the road it is a fact that on those drug routes those highways that flow from the southern part of arizona up into the rest of the united states on those small mountains that are there there are lookouts on every strategic point those lookouts are manned by two people and they are supplied regularly and they stay on that mountain for 2week stretches at a time they are well armed they have good equipment they have night vision goggles infrared equipment for daylight they have topnotch optical equipment and they have automatic weapons of all kinds and they have good food and good support and they sit up there and they have good communications so that they can radio from mountaintop to mountaintop and be able to tell each other where our drug enforcement people where our border patrol are where the ice people are where the special agents are where the park service people are so that when the coast is clear they canrun their large load of drugs up through the corridors now this is an astonishing thing to be able to see that military positions in the united states are occupied by the drug lords and their troops and that they are well equipped and well armed and well maintained and well supplied and they are manned 24 7 by two people and we are sitting down here on the floor of this congress thinking we can get a handle on this some other way but the numbers coming across the border are astonishing and the positions that are taken on those mountaintops where the lookouts are are shocking that we would tolerate that in this country know they are there but not go up and take them out the volume of drugs again is something beyond my imagination before going down there i had never seen such a pile of illegal drugs our federal agencies report that 90 percent of the illegal drugs in the united states come across the mexican border and the value of those drugs is in the area of 60 billion a year and we sit here in the united states of america we tolerate such a thing such a thing that we would let foreign interests foreign economic interests illegal interests violate our laws and enrich themselves with the wealth of a nation and the drug addiction that is here in america of course feeds it and that is another subject for another time that is something that we need to address that is one incident the interdiction of about 180 pounds of marijuana by the shadow wolves during a later afternoon down on the tohono oodham reservation but the following evening as i was looking around i went down to a place called sasabe and that again is on the border with mexico i visited a port of entry there that is manned by the border patrol they didnt expect that i was coming i didnt call in advance i just drove down there and got out of the vehicle and began to talk to them good people they are doing their job there and they are doing it well as far as i can see as i began to have a conversation with them there was an emergency call there had been a drug deal that had gone bad on the other side of the border in the mexican community just on the south side of that port of entry usually it is a shooting but this was a knifing and the subject who was knifed had a large wound in his abdomen about 32 inches wide entered in below the ribs on the right side and up through and it did end up lacerating his liver it didnt get his lung as far as i know but the word came that the ambulance was going to cross from mexico into the united states and they prepared for that they called in a medivac from the hospital in tucson and the medivac by the time it arrived there had been two unitedstates ambulances that had arrived the mexican ambulance didnt have any oxygen didnt have bandages had only surgical gloves on it was a paramedic that was with me lent himself right to the task and began to stabilize the patient when the oxygen came they put oxygen on the patient and held him stable until they could load him onto the helicopter and airlift him out to the tucson hospital all at the cost of the american taxpayer and the cost ofthis i will get compiled over time the ambulance that came across from mexico simply parked on the united states side two ambulances came in one from near tucson one from 24 miles away one brought oxygen the other was there for support and all lent a hand to get him loaded on the helicopter and flew him up to university hospital in tucson where they do a great job and they have the only trauma center in all of southern arizona it was a real eye opener for me to see this individual who had been knifed in this fight covered with tattoos and substantially pierced and inebriated with alcohol and cocaine at his own admission as part of the contributor i think to the violence on the other side and i am advised that that kind of incident wasnt just a fluke and i kidded the border patrol officer you staged this for me of course he didnt he didnt know i was going to be there but it happens about four times a quarter in that location alone roughly 16 times a year more shootings than stabbings when we evacuate people out from mexico into united states hospitals and so i followed up yesterday and visited the hospital and visited the patient and he had been stabilized and his life had been saved without that extraordinary effort it is likely he would not have survived the next few hours but his life appears now that it has been saved and i am grateful for that but i also met wifh the hospital administrators and they are eating millions of dollars of costs in funding the people who are generally illegals in the united states they dont separate that cost from those that are evacuated from an injury or a wound that takes place on the mexican side of the border but the american taxpayers fund this the american ratepayers fund this and the hospital swallows a fair amount of it and there have been occasions where residents and american citizens of tucson arent able to be treated because all the beds are full full of people who are illegally in the united states and so that health care for the tucson residents the americans occasionally will go to phoenix and then the family members that live in the city have to drive to phoenix to visit their family and just the travel time puts their lives at risk as well thats two incidents and i did follow up on those and i will follow up on the information that comes from it i would add the third incident was i went down to the border last night down to the san miguel gate on the reservation sat in the dark for 3 hours and listened and it wasnt difficult to hear the vehicles bring the illegals down near the border drop them off and hear them talking hear them hush up and then single file go through the desert brush cross the border into the united states and be off to points unknown 4 i used to believe that it was the illegal traffic into the united states that was the biggest problem and that illegal drugs was a problem that was part of that and i am informed that when we put the barriers in there the vehicle barriers that since they cant drive across the border with illegal drugs any longer in some of the locations there are many places where they can they simply put 50 pounds of marijuana in a backpack on one young male mexican or central american generally mexicans and each one takes a backpack of 50 pounds each maybe 10 of them at a time maybe 25 at a time they have caught as many ks a hundred at a time walking each with 50 pounds and they can walk through 10 or 15 or more miles of desert on the mexico side 25 or more miles of desert on the unitedstates side and arrive up at a transportation predetermined location and then drop off their illegal drugs there and many of them turn around and walk back to mexico where they pick up another load so the illegal crossings many of those illegal crossings are people coming into the united states with illegal drugs turning back around and walking back into mexico to get another load of illegal drugs sometimes i wonder if we wouldnt be better off in this country if they would simply stay here and get a job illegal or not and i dont advocate that certainly so as i listeiied nd was there while illegals were creeping across our borer in the dead of the night not even 24 hours ago and it is another dimension entirely to see the drugs the interdiction of the drugs the violence on the border the knifing the blood the lack of health care that is there the incursions on our border the volume that is backpacked up into the united states the volume that is trucked into the united states and to understand that if we can seal this border and seal it with confidence we could shut off 90 percent of the illegal drugs that get by in the united states at least until they find another route to go around but we can build an effective barrier and as i submitted that to the people down there working on the border consistently they realize that if we build a good solid barrier one that couldnt be cut through one that couldnt be driven through one that was solid and one that would make it easy for them to drive the trail and enforce it that it could be the most effective tool that we could have it costs us 6 billion a year to incarcerate the illegals here in the united states twentyeight percent of our prison population are criminal aliens that is our city our county our state and our federal penitentiaries 28 percent criminal aliens 6 billion a year we can build one tremendous barrier with 6 billion and a onetime expenditure of course we wouldnt get it all built in 1 year so we could spread it out over 3 or 4 years and we could concentrate on the areas that needed it the most we must do that stop the bleeding stop the bleeding first shut off the leaky pipe and then we can begin to have a legitimate debate in this country on what to do about the mess it has left but i submit that we shut off the jobs magnet and we end birthright citizenship another interesting little anecdote down in that same hospital was a mexican national who was pregnant with multiple births they took care of her prenatal care out of the hospital in tucson and they also set up the provider in mexico so that they could have the equipment to arrange for and give her good care for multiple births instead she waited until she went into labor waited close to the border came into the united states went into the hospital in tucson and delivered five children there to the tune of six figures times x those children all have birthright citizenship they all have now the right and the ability to bring in by chain migration their extended family members who knows what that costs mr speaker our compassion knows no bounds i understand neither do the borders of the united states of the america apparently the united states senate needs to pass the legislation 4437 that we passed in this house send it to the president for his signature establish enforcement and then we can have a legitimate discussion on whether or not we might want to have guest workers in this country

available to death row inmates the act will open up an avenue of legal relief currently not clearly available to disabled and incapacitated individuals who are unable to speak for themselves these individuals can become the subject of a court order affecting their death such as the case of terri schiavo terri is a florida woman who at age 27 suffered a heart attack and experienced brain damage due to lack of oxygen while in the hospital tubes were inserted in her digestive system to provide nutrition and hydration and continue to keep her alive ten years after terris unfortunate condition occurred her husband moved to have the feeding tubes removed intending to end her life this occurred after terri received nearly 1 5 million in jury awards and legal settlements fortunately for terri her parents intervened against the desire of terris husband and have stayed her death through legal maneuvering until last week on friday february 25 judge george greer issued an order to remove the

and husband have been afforded counsel yet terri has never been afforded independent counsel in a matter that will result in her life or death terri has had no voice of her own in these legal proceedings something so fundamental to every adult american even convicted murderers the case of terri schiavo deserves a second look by an objective court for example despite the courts pronouncement that she is in a persistent vegetative state evidence exists to the contrary terri is not in a coma as i would define it and i am a physician she is not on a respirator or other 24houraday medical equipment terri is responsive to stimuli such as voices touch and the presence of people she can move her head and establish eye contact terri can smile demonstrate facial expressions and cry she can arch her back and move away or towards voices and people terri makes sounds and attempts to vocalize as a way of communichtion as a physician who has cared for people in comas and who were considered in a persistent vegetative state i have some experience in determining the degree of incapacitation of disabled individuhls and it is a travesty to countenance the notion of putting her to death somehow because she is not able to speak terri and similar incapacitated people should be afforded the same constitutional protection of due process as death row inmates whose lives hang in the balance in judicial proceedings because in cases like these mistakes are not subject to correction terri and people similarly situated must have access to de novo review of their case and representation just like any death row inmate gets the incapacitated persons legal protection act which i am going to introduce soon explicitly recognizes in federal law the due process protection of habeas corpus appeal for incapacitated individuals who are the subject of a court order to effect their death by removal of nutrition hydration or medical treatment it does not apply to circumstances where advanced medical directives are in effect the act simply provides a final avenue for review of the case to ensure that a incapacitated persons constitutional rights of due process are maintained and that justice is done now we know that lawyers are going to file habeas corpus claims about this case and that is not a surprise and nothing prohibits them from doing so the incapacitated persons legal protection act is needed because the state of the law on this topic needs to be clarified these cases are typically reserved for criminal cases in civil cases like terris the decision to even consider a habeas appeal is at the courts discretion the constitution in the 14t1 amendment however gives congress the express authority to protect the life of any person by directing the judiciary with respect to the guarantee of due process and equal protection under the law that is what the incapacitated persons legal protection act does it tells the courts that the

appointed conferees on march 3 and the house on march 8 and yet 1 month later it appears almost no progress has been made in fact i actually would say that the conference seems to have gone backwards senator enzi the conference chair promised that there would be an open and bipartisan conference mr leader boehner promised the same instead both meetings have been held in secret by a small group of republican conferees there are a lot of important issues pending in the pension conference every day employers are dumping their pension plans and millions of workers are deeply worried about their retirement security and whether or not they will have sufficient funds for their retirement to support their families one of the key issues pending in the conference is whether or not older workers willbe protected when employers convert their traditional defined benefit plans to a socalledcash balance plan it is a critical issue for millions of american workers and it is not a new issue to this house during the 1990s hundreds of large employers switched to these cash balance plans including ibm whose conversion was ruled illegal as many as 8 million workers have been affected by these cohversions many of them perhaps half of them experienced deep cuts in their pension benefits as a result of these conversions lets be clear companies promised these benefits to these workers these workers earned these benefits then with some paperwork and a little fancy accounting footwork companies slashed the benefits of these workers how did the companies do it first the benefits of the traditional pension plan are based upon the workers pay at the end of their careers and when they are earning the most cash balance plans on the other hand are based on workers average pay over the course of their career with just a simple change on how benefits are calculated companies can devastate the retirement nest eggs of hardworking employees workers who gave up wages who gave up vacation days who gave up all kinds of benefits as they balanced out their pension plans yet we now see companies unilaterally essentially destroying the pension benefits that those workers are entitled to older workers under these conversions can lose up to half half of their expected retirement benefits dont take my word for it that is according to the government accountability office they tell us that that is what happens to older workers this chart shows exactly what happens this is what would happen to the workers who went into the workforce at age 25 and worked for a company they would see their traditional retirement benefits continue to go up with a cash balance plan the retirement benefits go down for the older workers this is what they stand to lose for anyone over about the age of 46 47 years old they have a substantial change in the pension benefit that they were counting on obviously for these workers out here at age 55 it is very difficult if not impossible to see how they would recover a sufficient amount of savings to provide for the retirement that they were planning on at that time and it gets worse if you are 60 years old so anybody after 45 years of age is greatly disadvantaged under these plans and that is what is going on in the pension conference committee is whether or not we will have the opportunity to provide for thoge older workers what we now see is that ibm did this and the court stopped those conversions in 1999 the house voted overwhelmingly on several occasions in support of amendments urging the protection of older workers the bush administration first tried to lift the moratorium and legalize these conversions but after 218 members of the house or the congress urged the president to reconsider he withdrew that proposal the bush administration changed its position and has submitted proposals that do more to help the older workers as part of the pension funding reform legislative debate senators baucus kennedy frist grassley hatch and lott brokered a compromise the compromise largely follows the bush administration proposal and was passed by the senate 972 this motion to instruct that i am offering today urges the conferees to support the senate compromise on protecting older workers in the cash balance conversion the housepassed bill contains no protection for older workers and would actually legalize some of

american free trade agreement i must say he has put many hours into helping to organize us around this issue and to present the real facts about what cafta is and what it is not cafta is yet another unfair trade deal that will hurt working families in both central america and the united states cafta is not only the latest unfair trade deal in a decade of failed trade policies over the last 12 years the unitedstates trade deficit has exploded from 39 billion in 1992 to over 617 billion in 2004 as a matter bf fact i think the most interesting thing about what is happening in the congress of the united states is this tremendous trade deficit under what is supposed to be a conservative president and aside from the trade deficit the united states deficit that we have here in america under this administration i think people should take note of that in my home state of california over 353 000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since 1998 nationwide almost 2 8 million manufacturing jobs have been lost since president bush took office in 2001 cafta is modeled on nafta the north american free trade agreement and let me say i did not support nafta as i do not support cafta the north american free trade agreement had a devastating impact on many american workers when nafta was passed in 1994 the united states had a 2 billion trade surplus with mexico in 2004 we had a 45 billion trade deficit with mexico nafta caused almost 1 million american manufacturing jobs to be exported to mexico cafta will cause even more manufacturing jobs to be lost to american workers i do not care whether it is a democrat president or a republican president i do not support these unfair trade agreements that cause us to have such huge trade deficits and who displace american workers i want to thank the gentleman from ohio for the press conference he organized where he had several business people who came to washington to explain how small and mediumsized businesses will be unable to compete with cheap labor in central america li 2100 what i loved about that press conference was the fact that we had these representatives from small and mediumsized businesses coming to washington d c to tell the truth about how they have not been represented here in washington many people think when the chamber of commerce speaks they are speaking for all businesses they made sure that everybody knew that this was not true they also made sure that everybody understands that the national manufacturers association was not speaking for everybody these are small and mediumsized businesses that represent the heart and soul of america mr alan tonelson with the unitedstates business and industry council mr jiin schollaert with the american manufacturing trade action coalition mr fred tedesco with the pated spring company of connecticut mr jock nash with milliken company of south carolina and the national textile association mr mike retzer with the w w strohwig tool die of isconsin and mr dave frengel with pen united technologies of pennsylvania and manufacturers for fair trade these business persons are the kind of business people that we talk about all the time members of congress on both sides of the aisle talk about how we support small and middlesized businesses how they are the heart and soul of america and how they really are responsible for creating more jobs than even the big conglomerates and the international corporate businesses we talk about how we want to give support to them well this is how we can support them enough of the rhetoric let us get down to business if we want to support our small and mediumsized businesses in this country we will not support cafta we will not support what they have come to washington to tell us undermines their ability to stay in business i think we could not have had a more clear representation of what is wrong with cafta than to watch these american business persons talk about what is wrong with cafta when american workers lose good jobs in manufacturing they often have no choice but to take jobs with low wages and no benefits the countries of central america that are included in this agreement are some of the worlds poorest countries the average nicaraguan worker earns only 2 300 per year or 191 per month forty percent of central american workers earn less than 2 per day central american governments do not enforce fair labor standards and thousands of central american workers work in sweatshops with dreadful working conditions cafta will do nothing to improve wages and working conditions in these impoverished countries opposition to cafta is wide spread not only in the united states but in central america as well cafta will increase agricultural imports into central america by large corporate agribusinesses these imports will put an estimated 1 2 million farmers out of work displacing families and causing an increase in world poverty when poor central amelican farmers lose their jobs they will be forced to move into overcrowded cities and seek work in sweatshops producing manufactured goods that are currently made in america cafta will cause american workers to lose good manufacturing jobs and again seek jobs with lower wages and no benefits at the same time cafta will cause central american workers to lose their farms and seek jobs in sweatshop with meager wages and no benefits cafta is not a free trade agreement at all it is an outsourcing agreement i say it again this is not free trade this is about outsourcing american jobs to third world countries for cheap labor that is what it is let us call it what it is it allows profithungry corporations to ship american jobs to impoverished countries where workers can be forced to work long hours for little pay and no benefits

have concern about american businesses mr president who should not be the piesident presiding over a bigtrae deficit a huge deficit in the united states i would urge him to withdraw this cafta
