percent of their in making this a nation of homeowners than income for housing under the voucher promaking the fha programs permanent gram almost half of the families assisted pay more than 30 percentof their income for rent a substantial percentage pay an unbearable 40 to 50 percent of their income and because of the lack of a rent reasonableness test in the voucher program the amount of subsidy actually paid by the federal government under the voucher program ishigher than the amount under the section 8 certificate program for the same amount of money over the same period of time we could house more families paying 30 percent of their income for rent under the section 8 certificate program than under the voucher program over 1 years ago the housing and community development subcommittee began the first congressional investigation of the potential loss of over 1 million units presently available and affordable to low and moderate income tenants as sections 236 and 221 d 3 federally insured and subsidized rental housing projects reach their 20 year anniversary and owners consider repaying the mortgages and terminating rent and occupancy requirements faced with the spectre of this loss which is even more devastating because of the failure over the past 7 years to maintain a healthy assisted housing production program this conference report contains an interim solution the owners of housing insured under the national housing act can neither prepay their mortages or in any way change the status or the terms of the regulatory agreement without the secretary of hud approving a plan of action which must be designed to preserve as much low and moderate income housing as possible this conference report is also a tribute to the survival of the rural housing programs of the farmers home administration congress has rejected the administrations attempt to eliminate this key source of homeowner loans for lower income families in rural areas and has created a modest loan guarantee program for families whose income does not exceed 115 percent of rural median incomes whose access to financing is extremely limited particularly in the case of firsttime home buyers the conference report also addresses the critical problem of the loss of affordable section 515 rental housing units for low income families through a program of incentives and refinancing owners of these projects are encouraged to keep these projects in the rural low income inventory for another 20 years or to turn them over to local nonprofit or public agencies without penalty the conference report extends the cbdg program for 2 more years and sharpens the focus of that program the amount of funds thatmust principally benefit low and moderate income families is increased from 50 to60 percent while this change affects the total expenditure in a state or entitlement community up to a 3year period it has not changed the low and moderateincome threshold that individual projects must meet the conference report also strengthens citizen participation requirements and assures that low and moder ateincome families that are displaced from their homes as a result of cdbg or udag funded activities will be compensated fairly finally the conference report establishes a program of nehemiah homeownership grants designed to assist nonprofit organizations to help families whose incomes generally are no higher than the area median to purchase homes that are concentrated in lower income neighborhoods this neighborhood revitalization effort is modeled after a very successful program initiated in brooklyn ny and was the subject of hearings held by the housing subcommittee in 1984 given the reasonableness of the authorization levels the inclusion of a number of reforms urged by our republican colleagues to the public housing program the rural homeownership loan guarantee program the section 202 handicapped program the enterprise zone program and the permanent authority provided for the fha insuring programs i urge my colleagues support for the passage of this conference report the text of the statement of managers contains an error on page 201 which i intend to clarify as the conference report provides under section 241 the 120day period for which an offer to sell to a nonprofit organization and public agency is required can only occur if funding is available for purposes of carrying out a transfer under section 502 c 5 a as amended i want to clarify that a provision contained in section 503 b of title v subtitle a community and neighborhood development and preservation pertaining to the classification of urban counties page 116 of house report 100426 is incorrect the correct language should be i has a combined population in excess of 175 000 has more than 50 percent of the housing units of the area unsewered and has an aquifer that was designated before march 1 1987 a sole source aquifer by the environmental protection

statement is entitled a committee responds this year this title is appropriate and fitting the subcommittee on labor health and human services and education held hearings for 4 months this year we heard from a broad spectrum of witnesses including those from the administration and numerous interest groups unlike other years many interest groups joined forces and pushed for their priorities this strategy was not only effective but sensible it has become clear to the members of the subcommittee and i presume to congress and the american people that there are programs that are in desperate need of a substantial increase in federal funding a few years ago there was a lot of publicity concerning the findings included in a nation at risk the administration publicly stated that it shared the concerns of our nations educators over the state of education however in its 1988 budget the administration didnt address those concerns the congress both the house and senate did put its money in the right place the conference agreement on the budget for fiscal year 1988 recognizes the domestic needs of this country without ignoring our national defense the budget conference agreement provided the appropriations committee with the necessary flexibility to address several problems and provide additional federal funding to key programs several of which i will address in my remarks this year the debate over education funding has centered around providing assistance to atrisk children these are the children who lag behind their classmates on standardized tests and who have not realized the benefits of our educational system many of these children are minorities some are handicapped some come from broken homes and they come from both urban and rural communities these children are however part of our future for our society to be all that it can be they must become productive and successful members of it we will have nice offices with no one to staff them well have a huge military with no one to operate the weapons and well have empty college dormitories because only a small fraction of our population will be ready or able to take part in higher education the labor health and human services subcommittee understands the problem facing at risk children in this nation and what needs to be done to insure these children the opportunity to get on the right track h r 3058 provides funds for highly successful and cost effective federal programs for our nations childrenprograms such as head start chapter 1 compensatory education maternal and child health block grant job corps and many others in this bill we have provided a 650 million increase for the chapter 1 program an effective program which can do a lot to address the problems of at risk children in relative terms this is a small step in recouping the damage that has been wrought since 1980 the proposed 1988 funding level for chapter 1 as adjusted for inflation is still approximately 13 5 percent less than it was in fiscal year 1980 presently only 40 to 45 percent of the 8 9 million eligible students are served by this program the increase provided for in this bill will allow the chapter 1 to increase its participation by 15 percent or 715 000 students i am also proud to note that the committee provided a 125 4 million increase for the head start program programs such as head start which are referred to as early intervention programs have been proven time and time again that they are costeffective programs early childhood education is a critical investment head start works hand in hand with the chapter 1 program insufficient funds have limited head start participation to only 16 percent of the eligible children every eligible child should have the benefit of a head start experience we have made a big step in the right direction another subject that id like to mention is the subject of aids this is another area where the committee and the congress heard the facts and responded the committee heard testimony from all sources that the federal aids research and education effort should be expanded greatly several institute directrors discussed the need to expand clinical trials on aids increased funds will also go to expand the effort to develop a vaccine for aids and expansion of efforts to develop drugs for treatment of aids and to test those drugs it became clear from testimony we received that we had to try for a new balance between our search for cures or vaccines with efforts to prevent and control the spread of aids and until such time as we find a cure funds must be provided to expand education and prevention efforts particularly those affecting the minority and iv drug using communities this bill provides 945 million for aids research and education 315 6 million of this increase can be associated with various information and education activities throughout the public health service including 95 8 million for testing and counseling the overall increase if 466 2 million over 1987 the presidents revised budget request requested 766 million just 5 years ago we provided 5 5 million for research the committee report points out in clear and specific terms the danger we face with this disease the committee has also directed that administrative steps be taken to increase the amount of scientific expertise available to the national institutes of health the alcohol drug abuse and mental health administration and the centers for disease control id like to remind the members of the house that this subcommittee conducted hearings for 4 months and had a markup which lasted 111 2 hours over 2 days we worked hard to fashion a bill that meets the domestic needs of this country like all of the members of the subcommittee i rise to congratulate the

like to entitle todays presentation as impeachment of ronald reaganno 3 i introduced house resolution 111 which contains several articles of impeachment and in which specific violations of our laws as well as constitutional provisions clearly indicate that the congress has an overriding responsibility and had best confront this problem sooner rather than later there is no question about the fact that the president is headed in an undeviating way into direct military intervention with our troops in central america what we have had thus far has been fragmentary participation in the month of may in less than a month and a week he will introduce over 50 000 soldiers just from our department of the army into honduras for supposedly training exercises which training exercises were inaugurated at the same time and coincidentally with his naming of a socalled bipartisan commission on central america while he announced the formation of the commission he simultaneously announced the greatest concentration of military strength in the history of this region of the world with a constant presence of the sea on both sides of the isthmus there on the pacific on the caribbean and over the air and on the land involving at no time less than 30 000 of our military a total of better than 17 have died in this endeavor there was very little notice it was really never reported but nevertheless they did what is inexorable is the presidents undeviating intentiontime is running out on himto intervene if i would hazard any kind of guess i would say by the month of june we will see the headlines and then of course the rest is history but at this point the very fact that the congress has abdicated its traditional role as set forth in the constitution in article i and it is a good reason why those who wrote the constitution and who exactly 200 years ago were engaged in that process at this time in the month of march that they devised that article i would be the policymaking body of the country the congress of the united states and hesitated long before they could reach an agreement as to the creation and establishment of such an office as we call the presidency in fact the words usually used were chief magistrate it was about this time of the year that john adams then minister to london from our fledgling nation concerned very much by the fact that this great historical and auspicious occasion on the attempt on the part of delegates from the various states and colonies to forge an instrument as a result of the first 10 years of rather failed nationhood government with the first and second continental congresses who fought the revolutionary war and then the articles of confederation i think we should note that during the first 10 years of our nationhood there was not any such thing as the office of a president or an executive chief because there was good reason for that they feared what the lessons of history clearly and demonstrably have shown all along john adams so fearful as he was a very very careful scholar deep researcher into the history of the experiences of mankind with government and particularly that very precious thing that we call selfgovernment which was a radical revolutionary concept the world was governed by kings or potentates who said that their sovereignty that is their source of power was from god well you could not go any higher than that or you had czars or you had oligarchies the select chosen few the idea that the people would be the source of power all source of power all sovereignty emanating from the people was just something that was not considered at all short of being highly revolutionary and radical thus the birth of our american revolutionary effort john adams then wrote to the various delegates particularly those who were here like james madison and wilson and mason pointing out that the only thing history showed was that where you had a separation of powers you had success in the foundations and in the formulations of peoples governments or democracies that where you had any kind of concentration of sovereignty in any one of these three basic organs in mankinds struggle to erect governments that you would not have freedom that you would eventually have tyranny and oppression so he gave us examples the experience of rome at the time that the republic was fading and men such as cicero were arguing hard and explaining why they had to have this separation of powers and fighting against what eventually became concentrated in the caesars of rome so today we live at a time when that dilemma confronts us as never before in our history during the period known as the nixon administration period and the very very cataclysmic things that followed for the first time in the history of our republic an unelected president two unelected vice presidents i am sure that those who wrote the constitution must have turned over over at least 50 times in their graves because this is exactly what it was they feared the most that was the result of the 25th amendment which i voted against and spoke against on this house floor i was one of just about 28 who voted no but the only one who gave his reasons in the record never in my worst fears or nightmares in saying what i said at the time that it was reminiscent the legislation was reminiscent of the old senate intrigue and conspiracy in ancient rome and in more modern times that third republic in france that winston churchill so well described as a maze and a puzzle encased in an enigma and all with intrigue and counterintrigue and power struggles within the ruling classes and of course the downfall of that republic to the german invasion and the overwhelming of the french countryside and french citizens and the occupation and the loss of its freedom to that invasion the facts are that we live in a similar period of time in that eternal vigilance as the price of liberty has no greater immediate and clear significance to us than today it is imperceptible as history shows when free people lose their freedom it is also true that the worst of slaves are corrupted free men we may without even a whimper much less of any threat of external invasion have indeed not only sown the seeds of the destruction of our tremendous government which some of us still retain the faith that demonstrates the ability of the people to govern themselves that in the long run the people know what is best for them that no matter what shortrun apparent victories of the oligarchan few that in the long haul it is the people who know best what is best for them of course democracy is disorderly democracy is not neat democracy is not very careful about the reverential spirit to the mighty and that bothers some particularly those who hunger for power will yield all to satisfy that power but again the history of mankind is as in the case of those great amassers of wealth it is never satiated for some good reason even in our scriptures they say he who loveth silver shall never be satisfied and that is true this is the reason why governments have been created as a means of defending the greatest interest of the greatest number the weak and the vulnerable from the mighty and the ambitious and the bold in the words of james madison how so are we losing that for the very same reason that the current administration and president seem to be mired in an unending tale and one yet to be told of scandalous conduct and illegal conduct we have been condemned before the world tribunal of justice several years ago for gross violations of international law for state terrorismwhich is what it amounts toin the very case of nicaragua which is at the bottom of all of the troubles that a very mixedup president is in today though probably assured very confidently that with the proper circumstances and with the proper conjunction of events by junebecause time is on him he does not have much after this yearhe must have an acceptable and at least for the moment an acceptance on the part of the american people for what will be a very costly venture to the treasure and to the blood of our men in this illbegotten course toward direct military intervention in a meaningful way with 50 000 of our military within shooting distance of what the president considers an enemy and who stands accused and convicted before world law of using illegal and unjust means to do what to overthrow a government that he sends an ambassador with credentials to recognize as the legal and duly elected government of that people and that nation so we cannot have it both ways we the american people through our representatives must either speak out or forever abdicate at a critical junction when it is absolutely necessary that these coordinate coequal independent separate branches of the government rise to the occasion for the greatest interest of the greatest number and that of our children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren as we compel them if this president has his way to forever live in a hostile world one that will invoke all the misery the divisions the hatreds of ancient origin or europe and the other older world certainly the overwhelmingly preponderant number of the american people are not desirous of that but look how much has happened the president has ended throughout the world in world opinion in disgrace in our own backyard we have allowed and the president has counternanced and in fact has even helped fund and finance with these illgotten gains from such things as the sale of arms

aggressively marketing existing sba and exportimport bank export financing programs and to provide help for small businesses with the processing of loan applications second it gives the small business

in addition any small business development center can apply for an additional grant to be used solely for the development and enhancement of exports by small business concerns i am especially pleased

already works effectively with both universities and small businesses and this bill will help to enhance and promote these ties finally these provisions aid the capital formation of small businesses

of that congress it was my privilege as a new member of this body to come to this floor with the same subcommittee and stand beside the gentleman from california as we passed lyndon johnsons initiative of that year for the elementary and secondary education act which is really the father of all these programs that are being reauthorized in this legislation over the many ensuing years we have learned a lot and we have had some tough budget times we have had to accommodate to those and they have done some damage to the legislation but basically over the years it has brought us to where we are now with a piece of legislation that takes a very realistic view of the budget and a very realistic view of the needs of education for the targeted population i think it strikes a reasonable

the cooperation of the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from vermont from the minority side of the committee in bringing to the floor as wellbalanced and a good piece of legislation that all of us can proudly support i think it is in the fine tradition of the committee on education and labor that has tried always to move ahead to the future this is an omnibus bill incorporating extensions of authorization for 14 federal elementary and secondary education programs slated to expire in fiscal years 1987 1988 and 1989 h r 5 continues the federal commitment to education begun many years ago and we continue it now for another 5 years into the future everything that i see and hear out across the country indicates that the american people would want this to be so i believe this is a good piece of legislation i commend it to all the members for their study and i know they will be proud later to have participated in putting this legislation on the books it was in 1965 that what is still known and referred to as title i of the elementary and secondary education act was originally enacted as a cornerstone of president lyndon b johnsons war on poverty in 1981 the legislation authorizing this program of compensatory education for educationally disad may 2 1987 yantaged children was substantially revised and is now chapter i of the education consolidation and improvement act eecial even so the pro grams stated aim remains the same as it was in 1965 to serve disadvantaged children who attend schools serving relatively lowincome areas chapter 1 has always been a highly targeted program and studies show that those children intended to be served are being served recent studies show that program objectives such as enhancing educational opportunities for children in lowincome families and raising the academic achievement of those children are being met chapter 1 as improved and expanded under h r 5 will continue to provide equal educational opportunities for disadvantaged children h r 5 continues and enhances our longstanding commitment to educational opportunity in this country not only for chapter 1 but for 13 other federal education programs encompassed in the bill h r 5 achieves this by offering programs that are intended to reaffirm as a federal policy the assurances that each schoolage child and in many cases their parents will have access to quality education that children with special needs will have those needs met and that excellence will continue in abundance to be an integral part of our public education system because the overwhelmingly successful chapter 1 program is primarily intended to reach a targeted group of childrenthose attending school in lowincome areas but who also have need of remedial education the committee strongly believed that there was a need to make concentration grants availableso that school attendance areascounties and school districtscould concentrate their chapter 1 grants in schools with high numbers or percentages of disadvantaged childrenand thus reach many more eligible children than such schools have been able to serve in the past this provides for better targeting while protecting the basic chapter 1 grant by providing for 400 million over and above the fiscal year 1987 funding level specifically for concentration grant purposes h r 5 extends and revises chapter 2 the education block grant to the states it has been streamlined to the extent that while it still serves all schoolage children it does so through programs selected at state and local discretion and implemented according to established need chapter 2 has been further revised to impose new requirements as well as provide incentives for state and local educational agencies so that block grants will be used to support effective schools and to require state and local accountability for the expenditure of these scarce federal grant funds in the case of both chapters 1 and 2 h r 5 expresses the sense of the education and labor committee that each program deserves and very much requires full funding so that no child will be deprived of a free and appropriate public education i would be remiss if i did not commend my colleague mr goodling the ranking minority member of the committee for his foresight in offering the even start program as part of h r 5a program designed to assist not only eligible chapter 1 children with remedial education needs but also to provide literacy training programs for semiliterate parents of those children this will involve those parents in the education of their own children while being educated themselves this important program will give answer to the urgent recommendation of the experts that a child that is read to at home by his or her parents is better able to achieve academically than the child whose parents cannot read to them or otherwise be involved in their scholastic experiences the parents of those children will now have that chance i am very pleased that 3 percent of funds appropriated for even start will go to migrant children and their parents h r 5 extends and revises title ii of the education for economic security act better known as the mathscience act it revises the program in a manner that will focus more of those scarce dollars at the local level to enable teachers and students alike to prepare for and respond to an increasingly technologically oriented society the adult education act as extended and revised by the provisions in h r 5 makes a concerted effort to address the adult illiteracy problem that besets our nation by targeting funds so that all adults are able to acquire basic literacy skills it is estimated that between 17 and 21 million young and old adults in this country today are illiterate it is my sincere hope that these new program initiatives will be funded so that we the richest nation in the world can begin to eradicate illiteracy h r 5 continues the historic requirement that private school children residing in eligible school districts received chapter 1 services on an equitable basis with children in public elementary and secondary schools in 1985 the supreme court ruled in aguilar versus felton that publicly paid teachers could not provide compensatory education services on private school premises particularly religious schools as a result of that court ruling there was an estimated 35percent drop in the number of private school children receiving compensatory education services in the year following the decision h r 5 authorizes 30 million in fiscal year 1988 and such sums thereafter as may be necessary for a program to help school districts purchase capital equipmentsuch as mobile unitsto provide chapter 1 compensatory education to eligible private schools in a manner compatible with the courts 1985 ruling because the provision to appropriate federal funds to assist school districts in meeting capital expenses required in order to continue to serve private and religious schoolchildren under chapter 1 is unprecedented i amended h r 5 to require a gao study of the impact of the felton decision on priviate schools and whether the provision of capital expenditures will enable school districts to again serve the numbers of children they were serving prior to the felton decision as is intended by the amendment other programs

received today from secretary of defense carlucci he is very concerned about this program i would like to read the letter at this time it says drai mn dickinson last fall as assist ant to the president for national security affairs i was involved in negotiating the socalled budget summit agreement under this agreement the congress and the adninistration adopted an overall framework for budget reduction according to this plan the department of defense was required to reduce its planned program for fy 1989 by 33 billion to 299 5 billion this was well below the level that the administration felt was necessary for our security but in the interest of reducing the overall budget we agreed to accept greater risk in our national security posture since assuming my responsibilities as secretary of defense in november the task of making the very difficult decisions required to meet this agreement fell on my shoulders i cannot overstate how difficult these decisions were they involved cancelling a number of programs delaying others and making reductions in our overall force structure the budget i submitted represented the soundest overall defense program under these difficult budgetary constraints i am gratified that to date the congress has not reduced overall defense spending below the level agreed to in the budget summit agreement however i am very concerned about congressional reductions to a central element of our defense programthe presidents strategic defense initiative sdi program sdi is the cornerstone of our overall defense program it holds the promise of a more stable and effective deterrent posture based on a balance of offense and defense the hopes we had for a more stable and safe deterrent under the abm treaty regime have not been realized the soviet union has continued to modernize and expand both its strategic offensive and defensive forces in an effort to blunt the credibility and effectiveness of our deterrent it is time we recognized this and took the steps necessary to rectify an increasingly unstable situation the case for the sdi program is further strengthened by the disturbing proliferation of ballistic missile technology the administrations request for department of defense sdi activities in fy 1989 is 4 5 billion this figure represents a reduction of 1 7 billion from what we had previcusly planned to spend in fy 1989 i recommended this reduction to our request with considerable reluctar ce us congressional reductions in sdi funding to date have already resulted in substantial delays in the lwogi w n hoever i felt that i had made a conlitnient to present the minimum overall budget requ et thatwhile accepting greatcr risk wsns consistent with our security requ remvnts the request the president submied for the sdi program reflects a balr~ice between our legitimate sccuri~y requirerrnnts and existing budgetary constraints and it is a sound technical program i regret the redections recrnmended by the armned servires committee because they would cause major restructuring and delays in the program further reductions in funding or other restrictions on the program would have the gravest consequences i urge you in the strongest po sible terms to oppose any such amendments if the congress sends the president a defense bill that contains a funding level for sdi that is in my view inadequate i would have no choice but to recommend a veto of that bill while i would make such a recommendation with regret i would not be living up to my responsibilities to the president or the nation if i failed to do so the point is that we came into this budget cycle with a budget summit agreement providing total defense spending of 299 5 billion after this agreement the armed services committee took the funding allotted to us for defense spending went through a series of hearings and came out with recommended funding levels for research and development for procurement for sdi and for other defense functions the committee itself came up with 3 7 billion for sdi to reduce it further i think is reckless is counterproductive and is a breach of faith with the budget summit agreement the amendment that i will offer will be 3 7 billion which is simply a re statement of the committee position restated i would urge the members of the committee not to cut sdi further we have already cut the presidents request of 4 5 billion down to 3 7 billion that is enough of a cut"], [0.5131288766860962, 0.5131288766860962, 0, "i want to express my support for h r 5 and my appreciation

among teenagers is among the most serious social problems in that age group suicide is the leading cause of death among persons between the ages of 15 and 24 second only to traffic fatalities the number of young people taking their lives has increased greatly in the la t few decades last year the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education conducted hearings on teenage suicide prevention a panel of expert witnesses offered their advice on how to prevent these tragedies the experts confirmed that there is a well established relationship between drug abuse and youth suicide my amendment recognizes this connection between drugs problems and other problems facing our young people no piece of legislation can be perfect and this bill is no expection i have serious reservations about one program included in h r 5that is the bilingual education act i have long been a critic of the bilingual education program for its failure to recognize the need to teach english to nonenglish speaking children as early as possible experience during the life of this program has demonstrated that teaching students in their native language has not proven effective although this compromise allows additional funding for alternative teaching methods such as immersion and english as a second language i would have liked to have seen it go further while alternative methods provide some flexibility bilingual education programs should be geared toward getting school children assimilated into englishspeaking classes rapidly and effectively the inability to speak english can severely hamper a citizens ability to participate fully in the mainstream of america we should not hesitate to support educational methods that ensure such participation another issue of great concern to me was the program improvement provision program improvement requires states to perform evaluations of local education agencies to determine improvement or decline in school progress state and local jurisdiction must be clearly defined while locals deserve the freedom to determine their curricula and programs states have certain oversight authority to ensure that schools remain in compliance with basic program requirements the conference agreement carefully balances this relationship states will receive a percentage of program funds to be used at the local level for program improvement furthermore the compromise allows local agencies workable time frames for improvements and provides states with the needed funds to help implement such changes the dual federal and state commitment is clearly formalized in this compromise i commend my colleague mr goodling for his tireless effort in forging this solution in the spirit of compromise the house accepted the senate proposal on magnet schools but not without a fightl the senate proposal establishes a separate program identical to magnet schools yet without desegregation as the main objective i simply do not see the need for establishing a new costly program for alternative schools the current program is effective and commendable in its purpose yet underfunded magnet schools have established quality schools in areas with a high concentration of minority students these schools have excelled in their academic standards and vocational skills they offer a curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of students of different racial backgrounds but most noteworthy students are accepted on the basis of talent not wealth although magnet schools are one of the most effective programs in h r 5 in the last year only 48 of the 126 districts which applied for funds received them there simply was not enough money to be distributed there can be no questioning the impact and far reaching effects of this bill its scope reaches all ages from early intervention programs for our very young to dropout prevention and school improvement for teenagers and adults to closeup programs for the elderly i want to

life in service to the american people bernie banks the director of legislative reference at hud retired this past january 2 after 40 years of federal service bernie has long been an institution at hud everyone who knew bernie will miss him dearly and will join in wishing him well in his retirement bernie attended kittrell college and received his bachelor of arts degree in 1942 from 1943 through 1946 he served in the army air force after his discharge from the military bernie held positions with the department of the army the veterans administration the census bureau and the unitedstates postal service before coming to hud and the legislative reference office in 1954 bernie served his apprenticeship in legislative reference until 1968 when he became its directora position he held until his retirement the legislative reference office is the headquarters for all legislative and regulatory materialscurrent and several years oldthat pertain to hud although bernies ability to maneuver deftly and swiftly through seas of paper to retrieve requested committee reports from congresses past is legendary in the halls of hud he has three attributes that combined to truly raise his position and performance to an art formvoluminous knowledge of the legislative process huds basic laws and authorities and how to find and work with legislative materials a detectives pride in pursuing even the barest of leads to successful resolution and a superabundance of patience for all with whom he dealt whether it is literally true as some have said that bernie has not forgotten any of the millions of pieces of paper he has ever touched there are few skeptics among the legions over the years who have sought his help in locating legislative or regulatory materials bernie was able almost unfailingly and often instantlyto recall legislative and regulatory items no matter how old convoluted or obscure bernie could produce however far more than the written word he could frequently recall important or interesting aspects of a bills legislative history whether a given amendment was adopted in conference on the floor or in committee and how far an unenacted measure proceeded in the congress and why it did not go fartherinformation that often is of critical importance to the legislative analyst perhaps most importantly bernie was able to use his vast knowledge to identify other bills and legislative materials needed to complete his clients knowledge indeed if bernies clients had the good sense to stay with him until he exhausted his knowledge on their area of inquiryand most didthey were treated to an informed discourse from a true expert and could return to their assignments with many hours saved and a full reservoir of information upon which to draw a former hud official said one doesnt have to ask bernie a good question to get a good answer bernie always approached his work as if he were a master detective clients would frequently have only a vague notion of what they wanted and would give him the thinnest clues with which to work bernies expression was one of total absorption and pure enjoyment as he methodically reasoned and questioned his way through the maze that so often attends legislative research and produced a full response that was precisely what the client ordered bernie also had an uncanny way of sensing what clients really wanted before they knew it themselves needless to say these abilities made bernie a constant source of information for those at hud and even some congressional staffers who needed to get the story right and in full the first time thoughout his entire 33 years in legislative reference bernie remained consummmately patient in his work he was always willing to take the timein an informative never condescending wayto ensure that his message was understood irrespective of the clients rank or position he also worked at a deliberate thoughtful pace that didnt vary in the face of a rush assignment but continually produced results faster than anyone expected remarkably no one can recollect even a single incident in which he lost his temper although surely he must have been sorely tested in his long career of serving the public bernie genuinely understood that the hallmark of his profession was to ensure that each client left his office with the information necessary to do his or her job better this was the principle that guided bernies many years at hud indeed it is one to which all of us would do well to aspire each of us i am sure echoes the words former hud secretary

committed to the concept of comparable worth and five people with or perhaps without that commitment the best possible circumstance that anybody who opposes the imposition of this concept upon the
