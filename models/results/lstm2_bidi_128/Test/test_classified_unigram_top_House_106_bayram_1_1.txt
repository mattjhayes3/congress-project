myself the balance of my time today we continue our commitment to end the death tax that haunts american families farms and businesses today we try to break the logjam created by yet another veto by a president who is determined to stonewall bipartisan actions by the congress of the united states i listened with fascination to the minority leader who just spoke yes there are differences that divide us major differences six years ago he proposed to reduce the exclusion in the death tax to 200 000 where is this newfound change in his position the change came because the republicans got a majority in the congress that year so today the democrats say oh but we have a better alternative the gentleman even referred to what revenue losses will occur in the second 10 years who knows no revenue estimator public or private can give us that number the longest estimate that is out there is 10 years but what we do know is that in our bill that the president has just vetoed the capital gains tax occurs on every sale of an asset from the wealthy estates left by the bill gateses of this world now the democrats do not tell us that that is fairness we say death as an event should not trigger a tax but when those assets are sold handed down by the very wealthy the tax is paid that did not show up until in the second 10 years but we do not get a revenue estimate on that because the estimators will not look out that far so i listen to this rhetoric of these numbers that are thrown around that are unsupportable and then the democrats say we will give immediate relief to the small businesses but it is a shell game another democrat shell game we think that our relief is under the shell yet when we pick it up the bean is not there because it is a fact that under the small business and farm exemption only 3 percent of the people ever qualify for it in the meantime they have spent millions of dollars on estate planners so the democrats say they are giving us something but only 3 percent of the people they say they are going to help will ever qualify now that is a reality just talk to anybody who knows anything about estate planning repealing the death tax is the right thing for america in the land of the free and the home of the brave it is astonishing that we let people be taxed after they die that is certainly not the american dream its an american nightmare my friend from texas says people get taxed on their way to heaven i say the death tax has given purgatory a new meaning death as an event should not trigger a tax that is wrong it should occur as i mentioned when the assets are sold some have said the death tax is ghoulish to think that someone who works for an entire life building up wealth saving for children starting a business running a farm or ranch and paying taxes the entire time gets hit once more from the grave but as my friend the gentleman from texas said it is not the one who dies who pays the tax it is the heirs who are left now the democrats will say oh there are only 2 percent of the people that are affected 98 percent get nothing the 2 percent that die are not the receivers of the legacy it is often spread out amongst hundreds of people and they do not consider the jobs that are created by the 98 percent who work in those family farms and businesses unaffected they say they are unaffected they are affected directly they lose their jobs oprah winfrey had it right when she said i get angry every time i think about when i die the government will take 55 percent of what i have earned and saved and why i am angry is because i have already paid taxes once why should i be taxed again that is unfair the ancient egyptians built elaborate fortresses and tunnels and even posted guards at tombs to stop grave robbers in todays america we call that estate planning millions of dollars paid every year for estate planning this bill really helps those people who are going to be hit by a hidden tax because any middleincome american that

actually hired to do this job they are the ones who are in the room cbo stands for congressional budget office and they have certified that the republican budget does not raid the social security trust fund as have the democrat budgets for the past 40 years here is what it says projected onbudget surplus under the congressional scoring the way it is done 1 billion and this is as of october 27 1999 now it is real odd to me that people who have been voting against every single appropriations bill because they do not spend enough money are now coming in here in the 11th hour and trying to rewrite the rules where was this fiscal austerity back during the september and october debates all we heard from the liberal side of the aisle was you dont spend enough money so we are going to vote no well hello where does the money come from social security we have held the line on it we have passed the appropriation bills 13 of them on republican votes because we could not get our democrat

of the house let us spend 40 percent actually i think it was 38 percent of the social security surplus on a whole line of new entitlement programs but the republicans key goal is to not spend the social security surplus that is a quote that is a direct quote from the white house chief of staff john podesta and that was as of october 20 now that is coming from the folks who do not exactly like republicans down on 1600 pennsylvania avenue we are not going to spend the social security surplus now what have we proposed doing we have proposed reducing the size of the government budget for every 1 we have asked the bureaucracies in washington to cut out a penny and they can do it here is an example of one place they could do it now we have heard there is absolutely no waste but this is the presidents trip to africa he went on a number of trips this year he went to china and spent 18 8 million took 500 people went to chile spent 10 5 million went to africa and spent 42 8 million and took 1300 of his dearest and closest federal government friends now there were other people this does not include secret service or peace corps this only includes federal government employees now under our radical budget the president next year would say 13 of those friends will have to stay home one example would be the mayor of denver the mayor of denver goes to africa with the president why is colorado so important to our african policy if so why not let the good people of denver pass a hat and pay his freight thirteen hundred people went to africa for 42 8 million there is not a member of

zero votes in the house of representatives my friend from wisconsin said that it is pretend time let me tell you how much pretending we are doing here yesterday official figures released show that the

not going to do this now but i might do this later and show how much various congresses spent out of the social security trust fund in recent years it is a tremendous amount as high as 60 billion in

the very time we should be working together we have region pitted against region i just want to point out the gentleman made mention of the fact that the average mailbox price in the upper midwest is

43 so there are differences but here is what we are talking about and this gets very complicated and i am not sure i completely understand it but we have 4 different classifications for milk class i milk is fluid milk that goes into bottles or containers that is milk for drinking class ii is spoonable milk that goes into ice cream and yogurt class iii is cheese and class iv is powdered milk now we talked earlier today about why many of us think the system is unfair because it still is based on how far it comes from eau claire wisconsin i mean we can argue about that but when we look at the chart that is basically the way that the various categories come out worse than that it is also priced on what it goes into now because 85 percent of the milk we produce in the upper midwest ultimately goes into class iii or cheese we get a lower price so we are closer to eau claire wisconsin and it goes into cheese so we are punished twice now we are very efficient and the demand in the competition is higher in the upper midwest so in terms of mailbox we come out a little better than we would under the milk marketing order price system but this is really about saying whether ones milk goes into cheese or whether it goes into yogurt or whether it goes into fluid milk one ought to reblend those prices nationwide so that everybody gets the benefit of being next to a large market

organization is almost 300 million short of the administration request we still have substantial shortages in the african development fund the asian development fund the african development bank which is only about half funded at half the level the administration is requesting there are a number of other shortfalls as well i think we need to understand that despite everything that this bill does so far it still does not lay a glove on the major problem which confronts the international community in terms of public health in 1999 alone 480 000 children under 15 died from aids approximately 430 000 of those deaths occurred in subsaharan africa around the world as was noted on this floor several times last night 1 700 children under 15 years old are in effect newly infected with hiv every

here because he is an obvious leader and he is recognized as such his ability to move this bill which is one of the most difficult bills to pass is proof positive of what i have said i want to compliment all of our colleagues in the house because this believe it or not is the llth appropriations bill this is only july this is the llth appropriations bill that will go through the house not including the supplemental which we have already passed and conferenced earlier so i am proud of this house of representatives the differences are obvious that is why there is 435 of us to express these differences but this house has done a good job in meeting its constitutional responsibility to move appropriations bills with that again i want to compliment the gentleman from alabama chairman callahan for an outstanding job and i guarantee him that he is going to be chairman of something very very important in response to the gentleman from wisconsin we are hoping that he continues to be the ranking minority member for a long time emphasis on minority i ask the members to oppose the motion of the gentleman from wisconsin to recommit this bill and to get to final passage and send the

for the 2 billion package for the costs of the unitedstates peacekeepers in kosovo or the paltry yet sorely needed 854 million for the pentagons embattled healthinsurance system i have serious concerns over the colombia supplemental package the 1 7 billion package of counternarcotics and development assistance for the andean region principally colombia may be spending too much money in the wrong places lets briefly list what this package includes assistance for colombian army counternarcotics battalions this includes 33 huey helicopters and 28 uh60 blackhawk helicopters along with training operations and maintenance and related equipment assistance for colombian national police2 uh60 helicopters a spray aircraft base construction upgrade of existing aircraft and provision of intelligence narcotic interdiction assistance for colombia and neighbors in the region some economic development including crop substitution employment and resettlement a modicum of human rights protection democratic governance judicial reform and the peace process as a member of the house armed services committee i have been privy to many briefings regardingthe grave situation in colombia and while i believe the unitedstates has a responsibility to assist the colombian govemment there needs to be a full and unfettered debate on the extent of american assistance for example we have been told by unitedstates military chiefs and pentagon officials that unitedstates forces which currently number around 250 personnel do not and will not engage in combat operations with the colombian military against the leftist guerrillas we are told that unitedstates personnel are there in colombia solelyto advise and train this sound bite is what has many members and security analysts making comparisons to vietnam looking at this bill we see vast portions of the funding slated for counternarcotics interdiction efforts yet no one can explain to me or any member for that matter operationally where does narcoticsinterdiction end and counterinsurgency begin another potential pitfall that troubles me is the rightwing paramilitary groups that have sprung up in colombia these armed militias which are tacitly accepted by the colombian military are reticent of the centralamerican death squads that killed thousands there in the 1980s i dont believe this bill contains enough protections to condition this military aid on a human rights certification basis finally i am deeply disappointed that congresswoman pelosis amendment to mandate funds for domestic treatment programs aimed at reducing demand representative pelosis proposed amendment would have added 1 3 billion for this purpose if you are going to effectively attack a problem you need to do so on every front with the republicans shutting off this wise proposal i can not take seriously their claims to be doing this for the children of america i am disappointed that there were not significant funds in this bill for a more comprehensive aid package on alternative economic development increased protection of human rights workers humanitarian aid to the intemally displaced and the peace process between the colombian government and the leftist insurgents as i noted at the outset i do support this measure but reluctantly whereas i have briefly outlined my personal reservations i recognize that there are many aspects of this bill that will do a lot of good in any case i hope that this body will have a future opportunity to fully examine the unitedstates militarys involvement in colombia our military experts are setting us up for at least a 5 year commitment my greatest fear is that years from now our troops will have become embroiled in this civil quagmire in colombiaa war that has been on going for 40 years true the civil political military situation in colombia is very different from vietnam but i ask does it not also look very much the same"], [0.9710160475224257, 0.02898395247757435, 1, "we have heard two presentations one by the democrats and one by the republicans on the budget we will have the budget on the floor tomorrow to vote on and nothing is more important than the budget this week but nothing is more important than the budget at any time the most important decisions we make in washington are the decisions related to the budget and the appropriations process the budget is the opening of the process which ends with the appropriations process people should understand that we broadly categorize certain spending goals in the budget and then it is the appropriations process that carries them through with the detailed expenditures i want to talk about the congressional black caucus budget a budget for maximum investment and opportunity which we will have on the floor tomorrow as an alternative to the presidents budget and the budget of the majority republicans our budget is very important and i am going to spend half my time talking about the priorities of that budget the six priorities of that budget but the seventh priority is the one that i want to begin with the mission of our budget is clearly the congressional black caucus budget an advocacy budget it advocates for those that are left out and forgotten the poor in general and more specifically african americans and other neglected minorities we concur with threequarters of the presidents budget and his priorities but we would like to emphasize certain kinds of things that get left out so in each one of these seven areas education housing health care economic development and livable communities foreign aid welfare and lowincome assistance and juvenile justice and law enforcement we have special kinds of priorities that we have within those categories we would like to make certain that those do not get left out this presentation will start with priority number seven which is a very unusual priority for the congressional black caucus to focus on that is juvenile justice and law enforcement law enforcement now i understand that in the democratic alternative budget that is going to be presented tomorrow there will be some recommended increases in the law enforcement budget the justice department budget but that is all about increasing at the investigative end increases for the prosecutions in general there are a number of things that are going to happen in that proposed set of budget increases that we are not particularly concerned with we would like to see the justice department capacity increased to handle some other kinds of pressing emergencies for example we have an explosion of high profile corruption and malfunctioning of the criminal justice system across america in los angeles in illinois louisville kentucky and new york on and on it goes right now we have these high profile cases that should attract the attention of all americans certainly the overwhelming majority of americans are concerned about these malfunctionings and this corruption certainly in the case of amadou diallo and the verdict of a jury there in new york state the capital albany related to a case where amadou diallo was standing on his front step and was approached by four policemen and they shot him to death fortyone bullets were fired he was hit 19 times and some of the bullets show he was hit after he was on the porch nevertheless those policemenwere found not guilty of anything not negligent homicide not reckless endangerment not guilty of anything a survey taken a few days later showed that the overwhelming majority of the people of new york state were outraged they disagreed profoundly with that verdict and felt that a great miscarriage of justice had occurred but on the other coast in los angeles we had a series of revelations over the last few months indicating that the police department has been carrying out corrupt practices for almost two decades that there are people in the police department who routinely routinely have planted evidence on people of drug selling evidence of various kinds planted guns on people beaten people and shot people and the los angeles government now is getting ready to pay out millions of dollars in response to court suits that are being brought on these matters as well as many many cases that will be overturned the lives of numerous individuals thousands of individuals when we consider the families of the people who have been wrongfully convicted or harassed beaten up the lives of thousands of individuals are involved in this gross systemic ongoing set of miscarriages of justice in the state of illinois we have a situation where there were 25 people on death row 25 people about to be executed we were about to play god and take their lives i am against the death penalty but those who are for the death penalty certainly would not like to see innocent people executed there was a special project conducted by some university students and they utilized the most advanced detective techniques including dna to check to see whether these 25 people were really guilty or not they were on death row they had gone through the whole system the district attorneys had brought cases against them they had been prosecuted by public prosecutors a judge had sat on the case a jury heard the case and now it was all over they were on death row to be executed under our constitution we guaranty the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but if a persons life is taken there is nothing else theyare going to be able to do they cannot pursue happiness liberty means nothing a death penalty takes away that life and of the 25 people who were on death row 12 were found to be innocent dna evidence about as conclusive as it gets was used to prove that 12 of the 25 on death row were innocent and i congratulate the governor of illinois for acting after that immediately to say there will be no more executions until we straighten out this tangle where is the criminal justice system going wrong how did it produce an almost 50 percent error rate in a matter as serious as taking the life of an individual for the commission of a crime twelve of the 25 were innocent let me see i have mentioned los angeles and illinois let us now go to louisville kentucky there was a killing of a young man by the louisville kentucky police two policemen were involved the police commissioner without telling the mayor decided to give these two policemen a medal awarded both of them a medal now they have gone through a process i think of being checked out with disciplinary hearings and steps have now been taken but they were given a medal and the mayor was not informed about this they were just given a medal two medals by the commissioner and the mayor rightfully so feit that that was an outrage to do that for something that one was questionable but to do it without his approval without his involvement was a usurpation of his authority and it was making a statement about his position on this kind of action that clearly was in defiance of his policies so the mayor of louisville kentucky fired the police commissioner and right now we have almost a coups taking place in louisville kentucky the police are marching through the streets indicating that they are really in command the police that should be under civil authority are refusing to acknowledge that the mayor is the final authority that the man who is elected who hired the commissioner had the right to fire him the problem is if we allow a police state mentality to develop in a small group that spreads to the larger group and pretty soon we are the victims of police state actions i cannot remember any time that a whole police force has defied their chief executive the mayor of a city and gone out and thrown down the gauntlet they are refusing to protect the citizens they spend their time in demonstrating their strength it is illogical to allow the criminal justice system to become corrupted what we have in america is a small percentage of police the extremists the fanatics and sometimes they are racists who commit crimes and acts of misconduct that by themselves are outrageous but we say after all it is only a small percentage of a total police department the problem that all america should be concerned with is the way the rest of the police department goes to work to cover up to protect and to nurture the fanatics and the extremists and the racists there is the socalled blue wall of silence where no matter what is done they will protect them and anybody that tells the truth will be isolated and browbeaten and harassed to the point where they will have to leave the force the code of conduct in police departments all across the country is that the truth is not to be told if it will get one of their colleagues in trouble so it makes the whole system corrupt as we go up the chain of command the officer at the top including the commissioner becomes involved in a pattern of coverup if the pattern of coverup and protection is there it means that the officers who are at the extreme end begin to have more and more people join them more of their kind come on to the force because they have protection of the system i have talked about los angeles illinois and louisville kentucky in louisville kentucky it is the police marching to take over the city a coups by the police department against the city government in new york where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated their outrage in the amadou diallo shooting we now have another shooting of a young man named patrick dorismond who lives in my district he was killed the mayor and the commissioner are behaving as if they want to stage a coups and take over the city against the majority the majority are outraged but they insist on behaving in ways that protect and encourage and nurture that small percentage of extremists in every police department the mayor has made outrageous statements about the last killing patrick dorismond a constituent of mine his family lives in my district patrick dorismond was in manhattan leaving work as a guard he was a uniformed guard he left work and went to a bar nearby he left the bar and was hailing a taxi to get home when an undercover policeman approached him attempting to entrap him in a drug sale the undercover policeman asked him if he had some drugs to sell he wanted some drugs this same undercover police team had already made eight or nine arrests that night they just wanted to bolster their statistics and make ten collars that night so they approached one more patrick dorismond patrick dorismond was outraged as he was being approached and asked for drugs an argument ensued and the backup policeman came on the scene to support his partner who was in the argument he shot patrick dorismond to death patrick dorismond is dead and the two policemen say it was an accident most unfortunate it was an accident and the mayor of the city of new york mayor guiliani ordered the commissioner told the commissioner to immediately release the criminal record of patrick dorismond patrick dorismond at 13 had had some kind of encounter with the police the laws of the state of new york say that the record of a juvenile should be sealed not only did they disobey the laws of the state of new york and open sealed records but they also broadcast them all over the nation patrick dorismond had had a runin with the police when he was 13 like a lot of 13 year olds may have a runin with the police patrick dorismond had had two arrests as an adult for disorderly conduct so happens that patrick dorismond wanted to be a policeman so the two disorderly conduct arrests that he had had as an adult plus the arrest that he had had as a juvenile wopld not have disqualified him from becoming a policeman they were not that serious but the mayor has chosen to make patrick dorismond look like a criminal by putting these things together and he has fooled no one the whole city is outraged again it is double outrage after the amadou diallo verdict now comes patrick dorismond with the mayor and the commissioner engaging in a blatant way in a coverup i mean they are encouraging and setting the parameters for the coverup in this case the system has gone to work to deal with some extreme activities on the part of individual policemen there were other cases of course besides amadou diallo there was abner louima who was sodomized with a broomstick in a police precinct abner louima almost bled to death in fact the hope was by the policeman who had so injured him that he would die but unfortunately for the policeman he lived fortunately there were complaints made by the family and they got through to a reporter and he got to hospital and he survived and the whole case broke as an exposure of what had gone on in that precinct most of the police in that precinct would not tell the truth the blue wall of silence went into effect immediately and nobody saw anything abner louima had to endure a horrible experience and they tried to pretend that nobody held him down while the guilty police officer committed that crime fortunately the federal government stepped into the situation and from the beginning showed a great interest and prosecuted the policeman for violating the civil rights of abner louima abner louima is not dead fortunately he is probably injured for life he will never function normally again but there was a trial and after almost a year of denying that any crime had been committed the blue wall of silence was at work concocting stories about abner louima having engaged in homosexual activity and that is how his guts were erupted or torn inside him all kinds of concocted ridiculous stories were manufactured until finally in the federal trial in brooklyn the perpetrator confessed that he had done it and was found guilty of course by his confession however even after confessing he wanted the world to believe he did it all by himself and nobody else saw it wanted to protect his colleagues and came back to court to testify in a second trial a conspiracy trial the conspiracy trial related to abner louima was probably more important than the trial which convicted the man who perpetrated the heinous act against abner louima because the conspiracy trial goes to the heart of the problem the heart of the problem is the fact that the colleagues of the perpetrators the colleagues of the extremists of the fanatics of the racists cover up for them they pretend they saw nothing they heard nothing the system in effect to cover up for the crime committed against abner louima his relatives went to the police station the next day and they were threatened and told to get away from there or they would be arrested all kinds of horrible things happened before this case began to rise and surface in such a way that the police department had to admit that a great crime had been committed and they had to go to work to do something about it but when the federal government entered the case early and began to question the police officers the blue wall of silence went into effect so they took a very important step in trying four of those officers for conspiracy to cover up because that is the heart of the problem the system has to be changed the system has to be attacked the federal government at this point has also completed a study of the pattern of activity in new york city with respect to the stopandfrisk and the way they police minority neighborhoods what does this have to do with the budget let me go back for a moment and say that all those people out there who were upset about the amadou diallo verdict and there were many people there was a spontaneous set of demonstrations high school kids without any tutelage or planning left their schools and demonstrated in the streets college kids demonstrated white and black there was no group that did not show their outrage today on the steps of new york police plaza a press conference took place of businessmen businessmen and labor leaders rabbis civil liberties leaders urban league a press conference took place where they all together condemned the latest activities of the mayor with respect to exposing the criminal record of dorismond as a 13yearold child and taking a position in defense of the killing of patrick dorismond before the facts were examined thoroughly our constituents in new york are very upset outraged demanding action from their leaders our constituents are demanding action against these gross misjustices fortunately none of these spontaneous responses have been violent we keep telling people it does not pay to go out in the streets and burn anything down or conduct riots as leaders we have been successful in making people understand that negative and unproductive set of conduct that should not be followed however they turn to us and say what are you going to do what about it well i want to say it does relate to the budget here because in our budget item number 7 is the juvenile justice system we want more money put into the federal criminal justice system juvenile justice adult justice law en forcement in general we want more money put in we also have a bill that will require more funds in the justice department that bill was put in by the gentleman from michigan 2 weeks ago and i would like to let everybody know out there the constituents that we are not standing still we are taking certain kinds of actions this bill the law enforcement trust and integrity act is going beyond what we have done already we have gone to the justice department we have gone to the deputy of janet reno we made our appeals there we have gone through those motions on these particular cases especially amadou diallo and we have now gone to the justice department about patrick dorismond in brooklyn the unitedstates attorney in that district the eastern district now has had a discussion on that so we are taking action at the level that we think we can take the most relevant actions we have accreditation of the bill that the gentleman from michigan has introduced the law enforcement trust and integrity act which will require additional funding by the justice department if they carry out these points i will just quickly summarize what the bill says the bill calls for the accreditation of local law enforcement agencies not to operate so loosely they should have a set of procedures and standards a training regiment which does not allow for inexperienced people to be set loose on the street with guns in their hands but make certain that they have had thorough training not only in the use of force but also an understanding of the community that they are patrolling this bill authorizes the department of justice to work cooperatively with independent accreditation law enforcement and communitybased organizations to further develop and refine these accreditation standards second point law enforcement agency development programs the bill authorizes the attorney general to make grants to local states and governments to develop programs such as civilian review boards early warning and detection programs which have proven effective in many jurisdictions and many kinds of activities which would help develop a greater rapport between police and the community administrative due process procedures the bill requires that the attorney general study the prevalence and impact of any law rule or procedure which interferes with prompt and thorough investigations of abuse in new york city they have the 48hour rule the police department the police benevolent association their union negotiated an agreement where no policeman who is involved in an excessive use of force case can be interrogated before 48 hours fortyeight hours must pass before they have the right to interrogate a policeman who is involved in some incident related to excessive use of force or the firing of a gun even if it resulted in the killing of an individual item four in the law enforcement trust and integrity act sponsored by the gentleman from michigan it enhances the funding of the civil rights division in the civil rights department it authorizes appropriations for expenses for ongoing investigations of pattern and practice of abusive investigation by the justice department item five in the pattern and practice investigations it enhances the authority to bring private cause of actions limited only to declaratory and injunctive relief when there is a pattern and practice of discrimination item six deprivation of rights under color of law the bill amends section 242 of title 18 of the code to expressively define use of force and nonconsentual sexual conduct as deprivations of rights under color of law item 7 the study of deaths in custody referring back to the illinois case the bill amends the code to require assurances that states will follow guidelines established by the attorney general for reporting deaths in custody national task force on law enforcement oversight the bill requires the department of justice to establish a task force to coordinate the investigation prosecution and enforcement efforts of federal state and local governments in cases related to law enforcement misconduct immigration enforcement review commission the bill creates a commission to investigate civil rights complaints against the ins and customs services with authority to make policy and disciplinary recommendations it is very interesting that in new york several of the cases that have taken place have related to immigrants amadou diallo was an immigrant from africa the country of guinea patrick dorismond is a haitian american abner louima is a haitian american i know this is only a coincidence because i have lived in new york for 42 years and there is a long list of victims of excessive force negligent homicide that were not necessarily immigrants eleanor bumpers was a grandmother who was shot down in her living room claude reece was a 13yearold who lived in a housing project in my district clifford glover was 11 years old and was shot in the back randolph evans was shot pointblank by a policeman who used a defense in courtcalled psychomotor epilepsy i have never heard that term before and since that case that trial i have never heard it since well the jury found the policeman not guilty because he hadhad a seizure of psychomotor epilepsy and he could not stop his hand from raising the gun and pointing to young randolph evanss head he walked off scotfree so there have been a long list of deaths of police killings and police brutality which did not deal with immigrants but it just happens that recently the focus has been by accident i think on immigrants so an immigrant enforcement review commission is very much in order item 10 federal data collection on racial profiling the bill requires the justice treasury and interior departments to collect data concerned with personal characteristics of individuals targeted for investigation etcetera the bill establishes civil and criminal penalties for retaliation against law enforcement officers who in gods faith disclose initiate or advocate on behalf of a civilian complainant in actions alleging police misconduct and creates private cause of action for retaliation these are 11 of the points that are emphasized in the law enforcement trust and integrity act many of them will require additional funding my colleague the gentlewoman from texas"], [0.9698123335838318,

"there is much good news in higher education this year andwe should take a few moments in the house of representatives to take note of it this is news for which we can all take some creditthe congress the administration borrowers colleges and universities lenders loan guaranty agencies so itis in that spirit that l offer these observations twentyto 25 years ago few people left college with student loan debt but today student loans are a fact of life for millions of students and graduates they have opened the door of opportunity 1o individuals who otherwise would have no options to improve their eaming potential president clinton recently announced that the student loan cohort default rate is the lowest on record falling from a high of 22 4 to 6 9 percent this represents a savings to taxpayers of approximately 7 billion over the period from fiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 2000 but more importantly it speaks volumes about the department of educations program flexibilityand willingness to work with borrowers secretary of education riley noted that this record has been achieved by a robust economy strong department management tougherenforcement tools authorized by congress and stepped up efforts by colleges lenders guaranty agencies and others what makes this even more noteworthy is that the decline in defaults came at a time when student loan volume was tripling and educational opportunity was expanding to more lowincome students entailing higher risks it is a great achievement the president also recently announced a reduction in interest rates for students in the direct loan program who make their first 12 payments on time students have especially welcomed this reduction in college costs stident organization leaders have noted that all students benefit when the direct loan program can offer the same kinds of repayment incentives as the bankbased federal family education loan program this encourages healthy competition between the programs which makes students the ultimate beneficiaries this reduction is possible because of the change congress made in the 1998 higher education amendments these changes gave the secretary the authority to offer the same kind of repayment incentives to direct loan borrowers as exist in the bankbased program i would also like to rote that there is a third piece of good news in which congress has played an important role in fiscal year 2000 alone 4 billion has been recovered on defaulted loans through vigorous collection efforts by the department of education and the loan guaranty agencies congress authorized the use of offsetting federal income tax refunds wage garnishment and other methods to aid in the collection of these loans what is important however is that defaulters also have the opportunity to get out of default through loan consolidation and the opportunity to repay their loans based on their income we must never burden students with loans they cannot repay and much of our current as well as future savings will be due to the appropriate use of the carrot as well as the stick declining default rates increased collections savings produced by the direct student loan programwhen we combine the fruits of all these labors the end result is that we are saving american taxpayers 18 billion too often we overlook the good news in education and fail to note the successes

by law to participate in the political system and the jews are the only minority in syria whose passports and identity cards must note their religious affiliation in 1992 as was said before as a result of negotiations by the president president assad of syria agreed to let those syrian jews emigrate to the united states so long as they pretended they were not emigrating so instead of being classified as refugees because we agreed the united states government to play along with assad to let him save face they came here as tourists on tourist visas and were then granted political asylum

how we got ourselves into that particular dilemma and i will also talk a bit about the situation in panama that whole region that has been such an active area as far as illegal narcotics trafficking and disruption in general for the entire hemisphere so those are a few subjects and then time permitting i will get into some of the updates that i usually try to do on problems relating to illegal narcotics and how they affect all our communities across the land the first thing that i want to talk about tonight is something that i hear repeatedly over and over that the war on drugs has failed that indeed we have lost the war on drugs i have some very good friends even on the conservative side and i noticed one of the columnists who is very conservative in his opinion this past week came out and said why not legalize narcotics that the war on drugs is a failure i always try to relate my topic of discussion to the facts and deal with the facts and statistics information that we have had presented to us in the subcommittee which i chair which is the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources of the committee on government reform we have had many many hearings since i have taken that subcommittee h10852 cc over the beginning of the year dealing with illegal narcotics and we have looked at the question of whether or not the war on drugs is indeed a failure we have looked at the question of legalization in fact we probably conducted the first hearing the only hearing to date on the question of legalization and decriminalization of drug penalties we have talked in our subcommittee and held hearings on the problems wvith mexico with colombia with some of our treatment programs and most recently the education program that this congress has funded to the tune of a billion dollars over the next 5 years getting an update on that first years progress in that program additionally the southwest border and the billions of dollars we spent in federal resources at that border in trying to contain not only illegal narcotics but illegal immigration and trafficking illegal commerce across our borders so we have covered the gamut of this topic we have heard from gao dea department of justice department of defense department of state many many agencies of federal government and rely on their facts and support and statistics in our reports basically i came to the conclusion and i think my colleagues would too if they spent time in those hearings as we have done we came to the conclusion that in fact the war on drugs did not fail what happened was we had an end of the war on drugs in 1993 with the clinz ton administration which took over not only the executive branch of government which executes the law but also had very substantial majorities in both the house of representatives and also the other body the united states senate they controlled and dominated the agenda the legislative agenda and the executive and administrative operations of this government for over 2 years from 1993 through 1995 i have had these charts out before and i will refer to them once again foremost in our responsibility as a federal government are our programs to stop illegal narcotics at their squrce outside the country now state and local governments law enforcement folks cannot do that but it certainly must be done and whether we legalize what are now illegal narcotics or not we would still have a fundamental responsibility in keeping what would be an illegal commodity coming into the united states in this case it happens to be primarily heroin cocaine and methamphetamines the first thing that the clinton administration did after completely decimating the drug czars office and that was the beginning of the ending of the war on drugs they took the drug czars office down from a staffing level of over 120 to some less than 2 dozen personnel that was the first cut slash burn that ended the war on drugs"], [0.0005013942718505859,

seniors did not have medicare when they did not have a guarantee of health care just as it was impossible for them to imagine looking forward into time what health care could provide now we are at a particularly wonderful moment in our history over just the past 5 years or so we took a nation that was plunging into debt 250 billion a year adding to the nations debt and by 1997 making a lot of difficult decisions including many that affected the medicare program and trying to squeeze out some of the waste and fraud in medicare and we balanced the budget last year in fact just late last year we made another huge decision here in washington we said we are not going to spend any more of the social security trust fund on anything else but social security and that is another milestone that was brought about because of the fiscal discipline that we have demonstrated over the last several years now we are taking down debt we are to the point where by the end of this fiscal year by next

from alabama i have serious concerns about the operation of our nations assistance programs with respect to ukraine and russia the gentleman and his subcommittee have been most helpful but i believe there are some remaining items that need attention particularly in the arena of agriculture where unitedstates policy towards russia and ukraine have lacked primacy have generally supported the old order rather than reform and have been unrealistic in meeting the basic needs of villagers and small holders who are raising the majority of food in both nations first most people know that agriculture depends upon seasons there is a time to plant a time to nourish and a time to harvest no one of us can change this natural cycle however it is my experience that the agency for international development has not been sufficiently sensitive to these natural deadlines when considering applications for program assistance in agriculture approvals are delayed past planting dates termination dates are set earlier than harvest dates it is as if the project is being set up to fail because these natural deadlines are being ignored can the chairman assure me that as we move towards conference on this bill that we can work to be sure that aid focuses more attention on agricultural reform in ukraine and russia that it improves the speed of its application review process

bass conservation act the atlantic striped bass is a valuable coastal resource and one of the most important fisheries for recreational anglers especially within the sixth congressional district of new jersey as a senior member of the subcommittee on fisheries conservation wildlife and oceans i have a long history of involvement in protecting preserving and enhancing the striped bass in fact i have sponsored legislation to designate the striped bass as a federal gamefish this bill would prohibit the com mercial harvesting of striped bass and reserve this resource for recreational catches only therefore ensuring a healthy sustainable rec reational fishery the recovery of the striped bass fishery since the crash of the late 1970s is a example of successful state and federal cooperation and angler support over the last two decades bythe numbers the atlantic striped bass fishery appears to be thriving and healthy but maintaining these harvests will require continued coordination and careful management the 199899 harvest data show a harvest increase for both commercial and recreational fishermen over previous years in fact harvest levels have been increasing steadily since the moratorium on striped bass fishing was lifted in 1990 in its 1999 report to congress the atlantic states marine fishery commission states that the 1999 stock assessment revealed cause for concern that striped bass were fished above the target level in 1998 and of particular concern was the finding that fishing mortality for older age 8 and up fish exceeded the definition of overfishing in 1998 these age 8 and older fish represent the most important age class for recreational fishermen and provide a large percentage of the spawning biomass while these stock assessment figures raise concerns about the harvest of larger fish the fishery does not appear to be in danger of collapse in the near future however i believe we avoid that potential threat of a collapse in the future in 1979 congress first authorized the emergency striped bass study as part of the anadromous fish conservation act to addressthe problem of declining striped bass stocks this legislation was later expanded by the atlantic striped bass conservation act of 1984 which ensured that the states would comply with a coastwide fishery management plan since its inception this bill has been a positive step in managing the atlantic striped bass fishery it is for that reason that i support passage of the atlantic striped bass conservation reauthorization"], [0.002047926187515259, 0.49795207381248474, 1,

talking about this has nothing to do with sampling to be quite honest this has everything to do to make sure we get the best enumeration possible rather than quoting republicans rather than engaging in a partisan vitriolic speech i would like to quote some members of congress i would like to quote the dean of congress the gentleman from michigan and i quote the local government officials have labored tirelessly for 2 years that ensure that each home and every person is included in the final census tally they understand the importance to themselves the communities they serve and the people actually we have been hearing from the commerce department that secretary daley will be encouraging the president to veto this legislation but i would like to ask the secretary of the commerce to talk to his own brother the mayor of chicago a democrat mayor of chicago mayor richard daley who said they the census bureau should come with the inclination to work closely with the mayors we are the ones who are in the trenches we are there we know our cities there should be an effort of cooperation and partnership that is a democratic mayor of chicago i would like to quote from the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on census in 1990 the gentleman from ohio a democrat local review presents thelast chance for local officials to have an effect on the completeness of the census counts in some ways it is the final opportunity to share observations gathered throughout the entire census operation this year lastly i would like to talk about one of our fantastically successful mayors a mayor of detroit michigan dennis archer who said just this year at the unitedstates conference of mayors this is dennis archer mayor of detroit michigan a democrat we as cities need to have the opportunity before the census count is in cement given to the president for the presidents review by the end of the year 2000 so we can evaluate and say here is where you are wrong and here are the changes we would like for you to consider i think that we ought to be given that that is the democratic mayor of detroit in my district i actually did a survey of all of the elected officials town board chairmen mayors county executives i have here all of the petitions all of the surveys from those locallyelected officials in the first congressional dis trict of wisconsin independents democrats republicans here is what they said this is the mayor of racine jim smith we would anticipate it would be very beneficial to both the census bureau and the city of racine to have an opportunity to review maps and addresses after the count has been completed and prior to the census bureau submitting its final account sheila siegler from the town of wheatland in wisconsin i believe the very best attempt should be made to get an accurate account and local review would aid that process our efforts are to get a better number are to improve the census this should not be about republicans or democrats we are going to engage in enumeration we know that the supreme court has said just that so let us work together and get the best count we can possibly get these gentlemen the independents the democrats the republicans from wisconsin at local units of government the democrats in congress in the cities across our nation they know the benefits of local government involvement this is not and should not be about politics we are not advocating a method that will cause a manipulation of the numbers we are advocating a method to improve the count local governments combined with federal governments and state governments can do just that lastly i would like to talk about one issue that has been mentioned by some of the minority today that this is a delaying tactic a tactic to try and frustrate the efforts of statistical adjustment that is simply not the case they had a statistical adjustment in 1990 and they had a post census local review it can be done it was done in 1990 they did a post census local review they did engage in a sampling adjustment they did not use it but they did engage in it this is not a delaying tactic this is simply embodying the principle that governments can work together at all levels of government the federal government local government state government the mayor of detroit the mayor of chicago congressmen and senators from both sides of
