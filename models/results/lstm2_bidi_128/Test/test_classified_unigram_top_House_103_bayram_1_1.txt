should be a partnership between guam and the united states nothing unless you believe that the citizens of guam should have the right to determine how they should be governed guam is currently an unincorporated territory an unincorporated territory means that first laws can be imposed upon the people of guam without consultation second any local law can be abrogated by the unitedstates

a possession h r 1521 proposes restructuring the fundamental political relationship between guam and the federal government to a partnership which recognizes the mutual interests of both parties this new partnership will not affect guams role as a strategic outpost of the military in the western pacific the federal government should and will maintain defense authority in guam if commonwealth

reliance upon the united states for its defense and the act acknowledges that defense and foreign affairs are unique federal responsibilities some of you might ask why are the people of guam seeldng commonwealth status why not remain a territory as a territory guam has all of these tax benefits guam desires stability and some control over its status this reminds me of a man who asks his

over its status some of you might ask why commonweath status why not statehood why not independence why not free association the voters of guam have made that determination in january 1982 two plebiscites were conducted to give the voters of guam the chance to choose the future political direction of guam the options included status quo statehood incorporation commonwealth independence and free association in the first plebiscite 49 percent of those voting chose the commonwealth option 26 percent chose statehood 10 percent chose keeping the status quo only 5 percent of the voters selected incorporated status while 4 percent opted for independence and 4 percent opted for free association independence later that year a runoff plebiscite was held between statehood and commonwealth choices this vote attracted over 81 percent of the voters an overwhelming 73 percent of these voters supported commonwealth status the voters chose commonwealth status it is believed because it was considered to be the most pragmatic and attainable of the options thus the philosophy of the commonwealth act is to structure a better relationship with the united states a relationship tailored to meet the unique circumstances that exist on guam a relationship tailored to meet the growing aspirations of the people of guam for greater seifsufficlency a relationship tailored to

the date that the people of greek heritage and the greek orthodox faith as well as freedomloving individuals everywhere celebrate the symbolic rebirth of democracy greek independence day march 25 1994 is the 173d anniversary of the beginning of greeces struggle for independence from more than 400 years of foreign domination it was on this historic day that the greek people began a series of uprisings against their turkish oppressors uprisings that soon turned into a revolution attracting wide international support the greeks long and arduous struggle against the ottoman empire is a perfect example of the ability of mankind to overcome all obstacles if the will to persevere is strong enough and the goalin this case the dream of freedomis bright enough america the united states of america is surely the truest expression of this dream today it remains an imperfect dream yes but still the shining example that oppressed people throughout the world have looked to for generations have gained strength from in their struggle to overcome their oppressors this dream of democracyborn so long ago in greece and its greatest tangible expression in our great democratic republic forms the common bond between our two nations furthermore it is a bond that has stretched throughout history from ancient times to the present day in ancient mythology fire was brought down from mount olympus and offered to the greeks as a gifta gift that transformed their lives similaxly the gift of democracy was offered to the world by the ancient greeks and it too was a transforming gift in fact it continues to transform the world with stories of heroes and remarkable events the history of the greek wax for independence also is filled with heroes and heroism remarkable events by many peoples in a common cause it is partly the story of the klephts who descended upon the invaders from their mountain strongholds it is also the story of the hydriots seafarers who broke the ottoman naval blockade and it is the story of the philhellenes who took these tales of courage to europe where their significance was not overlooked these stories woven together formed the fabric of a free and independent greece of democracy returned to the cradle where it was born and defended by the defiant cries of the greek patriots eleftheria i thanatos liberty or death however democracywhich places the hands of the common man on the wheel of destinybrings with it dangers as well freedom often brings with it old antagonisms nationalist disputes that must be reconciledand the old truism that warfare is only an extension of diplomacy is no better demonstrated than in the balkans yugoslaviacobbled together out of many competing ethnic factions and for years held together by the force of communismhas fragmented explosively fighting continues throughout the balkan regionand one old dispute in particular threatens the cradle of democracy greece itself the greek government protested when in 1945 yugoslavias commun ist dictator tito usurped the name macedonia for a province carved out of southern yugoslavia to diminish the power of serbia this served only to inflame competing interests in a region stretching well beyond the borders of yugoslavia and unstable since the days of alexander the great while this province now understandably seeks its freedom the concept of macedonia must in no way be restricted within the borders of this tiny land to recognize this province as an independent nation under the name macedonia would i fear unleash antagonisms already bubbling at the boiling point regrettably however the clinton administration has granted full diplomatic recognition to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia this action is cause for great concern because the name macedonia is historically tied to the northern greek province of salonika home to alexander the great as a result an extremely volatile atmosphere has been created along the northern border of greece as recounted in the new york times constitutional language regarding a future union of the wider lands of ancient macedoniawhich reach into bulgaria albania and greecespark resentments and suspicion promises to protect the cultural economic and social rights of macedonians in surrounding countries are equally ominous more blatant still are maps circulating in the region and bearing the seal of the macedonian national liberation army maps that depict the envj ioned nation of macedonia with borders reaching into eastern albania southwestern bulgaria and a full quarter of mainland greece frequent radio broadcasts from yugoslavias macedonian province call for the unification of macedonia and for the freeing of millions of oppressed macedonians in greece i the establishment of diplomatic relations with fyrom would be a serious deterrent to the negotiation process and would impede efforts to promote a solid and cooperative relationship between those two countries this action would also threaten the historic military and cultural relationship between the united states and greece the establishment of diplomatic relations between the united states and fyrom would send precisely the wrong message at precisely the wrong time the prospects for peace in the region will not be enhanced by this action indeed they might very well be compromised this is not a matter of semantics this is a matter of national identity international respect for traditional concepts of national sovereignty and a recognition of the long and turbulent history of the balkan region mere names are often used to support territorial claims and ethnic divisions which transcend the centuries we must stand by our longtime ally and never forget that the ancient greeks forged the very notion of democracy placing the ultimate power to govern in the hands of the people themselves the dream of selfrule was madereality as our founding fathers drew heavily on the political and philosophical experience of ancient greece in forming our government for that contribution alone we owe a great debt to the greeks in the american colonial period during the formative years of what would be our great republic no feature was more prominent than the extent to which greek and roman sources were cited by the framers of the constitution the very basis of our constitution derived from aristotle and was put into practice in ancient rome in 18thcentury england and in the early state constitutions before it was given its national embodiment by the convention of 1787 the overriding appreciation was for aristotles sense of balance since the delegates viewed the tyrant and the mob as equally dangerous indeed both james madison and john adams emphasized what aristotle had written in the politics that the more perfect the admixture of the political elements the more lasting will be the state through the recognition of the idea of a separation of powers a system of checks and balances was instituted in american government thus as another of the ancient greeks polybius foresaw and wrote when one part having grown out of proportion to the others aims at supremacy and tends to become too dominant none of the three 4s absolute our founding fathers were eager to relate the american experiment to the efforts of the ancient greeks to estab lish a balance of powers such a relationship it was hoped by the framers would allow america to escape the disintegration of government that had proven inevitably fatal to other political systems throughout history it is the example of the ancient greeks that we celebrate each march 25th that and the return of democracy to greece on this day of glory for the greek people the spirit of democracy and of this day lives on in the defense of the principles for which so many of the free worlds citizens have given their lives today we celebrate together with greece in order to reaffirm the democratic heritage that our two nations share so

secretary of labor and former pension participants to seek appropriate relief when erisa violations involving the purchase of annuities occur in connectionwith the termination of a pension plan or an individuals statusas a participant in july of 1993 the subcommittee on labormanagement relations held an oversight hearing on this annuity issue among other erisa enforcement issues during the hearing concern was raised that after the decision by the supreme court in mertens versus hewitt current law could be read as narrowing the remedies under erisa upon which participants and beneficiaries have previously relied to fully restore denied pension plan benefits specifically there was concern that the case could undermine the efforts of the department of labor to recover the reduction of annuity payments for former pension plan participants in the case of kayes versus pacific lumber which was cited in the mertens case the unitedstates district court for the northern district of california held that former participants and beneficiaries who were given executive life annuities do not have standing to sue under title i of erisa s 1312 would clarify that erisa does give standing to former participants and beneficiaries if they seek relief in connection with a fiduciary breach involving the purchase of insurance contracts or annuities under s 1312 this standing would be retroactive in

of the united states of america and to fight for freedom when we gave our word to them the gentleman from new york did not forget and has kept the faith with them over the years i am very proud to be withthe gentleman here today to declare that september 16 should be a day in memory of our mia pows this issue has unlike the exemplary job mr gilman has done has been a disgrace on the part of so many american officials and so many elected officials as well i remember when i was a young reporter shortly after the mia pows were supposedly all returned i was a young reporter and interviewed richard nixon in los angeles i will never forget that interview because i asked him whether or not he was certain all of our mia pows had been returned from vietnam and he gave me a statement to that effect however after the interview i thought to myself the president did not give me any reason to believe that all of the mia pows were returned except that he was satisfied it seemed to me if he was satisfied and that was not just a public statement he would have given me reasons to believe that so i walked away from that interview so many years ago 20 years ago now saying you know i dont think he was telling me the truth i think he thinks there may still be some mia pows in vietnam the question we have to ask ourselves at that time why would the vietnamese have ever given up all of their leverage on the united states of america in order to give back all of those people who had been there bombing them and participating in the war agains t them i at that time the war was still going on in cambodia war was still going on in laos in fact a war was still going on it south vietnam there was every reason to question whether or not the vietnamese gave back all of those pow mias at that time we have heard over and over and over again these years that the communist regime in hanoi has been cooperative well itjust aint so the history of our dealings with hanoi in terms of our mia pow record is a record of deceit footdragging and manipulation it is a history of we ourselves bending over backward to give the very best interpretation of all of hanois actions it is a history of a mindset on the part of american officials to debunk the entire mia pow issue especially if there are any livesighting reports about possible powy mias still in the hands of the communists now are there still live pows especially after all of these years i happen to believe it is likely that they kept some americans after claiming they returned them all that does not mean these men would still be alive today i do not know if they are or not and i am not saying they were kept what i do know is that the american people have been lied to on this issue over and over again what i do know is hanoi has not been cooperating as we have been told on this issue less than a year ago i was up on the cambodianvietnamese border with our american pow teams out there in the jungle trying to find desperately working under horrible conditions having to cut landing pads out of the jungle in order to try to find a hospital where some of our mia1 pows were kept near the end of the war the trouble is hanoi could tell us the location of this hospital which was a major facility during the wax simply by having any one of the thousands of north vietnamese who were stationed at that hospital go to the scene and help our people locating it but instead our teams have been put through a grueling practice over and over again trying their hardest working long hours to find even the minuscule bit of information one of our own colleagues pete peterson of florida was held for 6 years as a prisoner of war on the way over to vietnam i asked petr if he has been a prisoner of war designated as a prisoner of war the entire time he was held captive he told me no in fact during the first 3 years of his captivity he was labeled as an mia meaning even his family did not know that he was being held captive by the north vietnamese during that time that he was kept there and i think this is important mr peterson was kept totally separate from all other americans no one knew that he was being held captive in fact had he been kept instead of declared a pow we would not have known he would have been there at all it is possible other americans were held in the same way i am not saying that is absolutely the case but that it is worth putting pressure on the vietnamese instead of bending over backward giving them the benefit of the doubt when i was with them negotiating this issue they told me that record that pet petersonthe prison in which he was held those 6 years were not available to us now those records could have disclosed to us whether or not there were other prisoners in this status listed as mia and being part of the prison population in fact we have not been given the record of any of those prisons that to me indicates the vietnamese have been deceptive we do not need to bend over backward in the powimia issue to normalize relations rush in with a trading relationship with people who are treating us with that type of arrogance i would say during this time period the one hope that any people have of actually coming to the truth to flnding out what happened in there in southeast asia to our mviapow s is to make sure we as american citizens keep the pressure up on our own government and on hanoi that is why this resolution today is so important that is why on september 16 i hope that all americans will fly their mia pow flags at their local libraries and people will come forward and give radio interviews and talk to other americans and others about the issue of nmipo ws we should never forget this war in vietnam we should never forget the lessons we learned there there are a lot lessons to be learned but most importantly never forget the men and women who marched off they placed their lives on the line for us and we should make sure they are never

that were originally included in the house reconciliation bill through the leadership of the caucus the attack launched on these provisions by conservatives in both parties and in both legislative bodies has been repulsed the people won out on balance this legislation represents a progressive step forward a small step but a step nonetheless we are on our way toward fuffiling president clintons promise to put people first in washington again though many of the provisions benefiting lowincome people that were in the original house bill have been watered down and scaled back in this conference report this legislation still provides significant gains for lowincomes families an increase of 1 billion is provided for the title xx social servces block grant program which supports child care and other social services some of these additional resources win be targeted to empowerment zones designated in highpoverty communities it establishes a new 500 million childhood immunization program to provide free immunization to all children who are enrolled in medicaid and to any child whose family does not have health insurance an additional 2 5 billion is provided to expand food stamp benefits for the needy allowable deductions from incomes for shelter and child care expense are significantly increased and the earnings of high school students are completely excluded from the calculation of food stamp benefit amounts the student loan reforms contained in the legislation reduce the origination fees and interest rates now paid by student borrowers the bill also provides additional 879 million for the family preservation act to support child welfare services designed to keep troubled families intact and to avoid unnecessary ioster care and other outofhome plaemen most slgnlflcantly this legislation provides for a major 20 8 billion expansion of the earned income tax credit for lowincome working families under this bill many more families including families without children will be eligible for the credit and they will receive substantially greater assistance generally between 200 and 500 depending on the family situation these provisions are expected to put an additional 68 million in the pockets of more than 39 000 working families in the 11th congressional district who are struggling to make ends meet i am also pleased that the conference agreement does not impose the burden of deficit reduction on the backs of poorand middleclass americans families earning less than 30 000 annually would actually see their tax bill reduced working families earning less than 180 000 annually would see no increase in their income taxes the increased tax burden of the higher gas tax for families earning between 30 000 and 50 000 annually would be less than 10 a month overall fully 82 percent of the tax increases set out in this legislation would be paid by persons earning more than 200 000 a year the corporate tax increases set out in this legislation are also targeted on the largest and wealthiest corporations many small businesses wili actually see their tax bill reduced as a result of this legislation some 90 percent of them will be eligible for an array of new and expanded tax credits and deductions there are a great many provisions of this legislation with which i adamantly disagree the cuts it makes in medicaid and medicare are steep and wil be extraordinarily difficult for the hospitals and other health care providers in brooklyn to absorb increases in the medicare part b premium paid by participants are not as they should be limited to the annual percentage increase in social security bone fits this already excessive premium will continue to race out of control my hope however is that both of these issues can be addressed when the congress takes up health care reform laterthis year the legislation also preserves far too many agricultural subsidies which president clinton had sought to cut or eliminate producers of honey tobacco and mohair would continue to remain on the federal dole i am also extremely concerned about the impact that the legislations mandated spending caps will have on our ability to provide necessary funding increases for federal education programs a massive new federal reinvestment in these programs is essential to our economic competitiveness the budget caps in this bill must not deter us from making that investment if necessary we must shift funds from other lower priority programs to finance it i also oppose the higher income taxes the bill would impose on middle and upperincome social security recipients i am pleased that these tax increases have been scaled back from what was originally set out in the house bill and would not levy taxes on any social security recipients who are not already paying taxes on their benefits i remain opposed to these higher taxes however because i know that they will hit many of my senior citizen constituents very hard social security recipients have earned every penny of their benefits they are not some gift or extra frill that can be taken or taxed away by the government with impunity morever indivlduals with incomes of 34 000 are not welloff by any stretch of the imagination and they should not be asked to shoulder such a large share of the deficit reduction burden in my view higher corporate and individual income taxes and deeper cuts in agricultural subsidies should have been substituted for the social security tax provisions in this bill despite these misgivings i believe that h r 2264 is on balance a fair and progressive piece of legislation it represents just a tiny step forward toward reordering our federal priorities to put the people first but it is a step worth taking i will however continue to work alongside my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to press the congress and the president to go the full distance we will not rest until they do"]]}
