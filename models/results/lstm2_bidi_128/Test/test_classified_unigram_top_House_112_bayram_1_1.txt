yielding me this time i rise in strong opposition to this bill not because i oppose the repealing of the 1099 reporting requirements i do i have a record of supporting 1099 repeal and relieving americas small businesses from onerous paperwork and onerous regulations what im opposed to is paying for this small business tax bill by increasing taxes on working middle class americans and that is exactly what this legislation will do lets not kid ourselves democrats offered a different path last july we put forward legislation to repeal the 1099 reporting requirements and we paid for it by eliminating loopholes in the tax code that reward those exporting unitedstates jobs overseas and the senate has offered an alternative path as well last month they overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan repeal of the 1099 reporting requirement which did not include a tax increase on middle class workers but my republican colleagues in the majority here in the house who have continually preached lower taxes less regulation and fiscal discipline have refused either of these alternative approaches instead my republican colleagues are forcing a vote today on h r 4 a measure that will impose a 25 billion new tax on middle class families yes you heard that right it is only 59 days since my republican colleagues have assumed majority control of the house of representatives and theyre already breaking their campaign pledge of no new taxes a pledge that 234 of 241 sitting republican members of the house signed and no republicans are not taxing the wealthiest 1 percent to pay for this small business relief bill they are raising taxes on middle class workers like firefighters police officers nurses and teachers the very american families who work day in and day out to make their financial ends meet the very american families under attack today in wisconsin in indiana in ohio and across the midwest now the republicans will not admit that embedded in h r 4 is a tax increase on the middle class but the facts are the facts the joint committee on taxation says the republican bill is a tax increase citing how it will raise 25 billion in new revenue that is congressionalspeak for a tax increase even grover norquist the author of the taxpayer protection pledge has said americans for tax reform has always followed committee on joint taxation methodology yet still my republican friends deny and deny and deny but my friends read my lipsrepublicans are raising taxes just look at the contents of the bill under the democratic health reform law an american family of four earning 88 000 a year is obligated to pay no more than 9 5 percent of their income on health care premium costs in this example that is 8 360 that comes out of their pocket on a typical family policy valued at 13 000 so the family would pay out of their pocket 8 360 in annual premiums for their health care coverage and the federal government would provide a tax creditnot a subsidy not a subsidy a tax creditvalued at 4 640 to cover the rest these are not subsidies but tax credits to working people they work exactly like the child tax credit or the tax credit to make college more affordable how many of all of our constituents use those tax credits do they believe it is welfare a form of welfare i dont think so they understand the difference between a subsidy and a tax credit these are not subsidies for the middle class they are tax credits for the middle class these are tax relief measures for the middle class the affordable care act also ensures that the federal funding going towards a familys health premium is paid directly to the insurance carrier to the insurance company not to the family in short the family receiving this tax credit will never ever personally touch that money not a single dime do they feel it never transfers through them however under the republican bill h r 4 if that very same family that earns 88 000 the breadwinner of the family is called into the bosss office and the boss says you know what youre on your track to management youre doing such a great job were going to give you a 250 bonus take the family out to dinner its the holiday season and youre overjoyed you go back to your family and say i am management material i got a 250 bonus im taking everybody out to dinner tonight well heres the rub you would go from the 398 percentile of the federal poverty level to the 401 percentile of the poverty level when that happens you would then owe the federal government for that 250 in april of the next year the federal government would say not so fast you owe us 4 640 to make up for your having accessed those tax credits thats right they would have to pay back every single dime that went directly to that health insurer to that health insurance company when a dime never crossed their fingers not a single dime crossed their fingers say it aint so joethats what families back home in my district are saying but i cant its true republicans are raising taxes the

in the house has not offered a single bill to create a single job in fact the only thing that the congress has been doing is creating an environment where public sector jobs are cut and where private sector jobs though they have been growing are offset by those public sector cuts leaving us with an unemployment rate which were happy to have at 8 6 percent but within the historical context is still a national disgrace and an outrage to have unemployment at 8 6 percent for so very long but were happy to have it because it has been as high as 10 and now were threatening to leave more than 2

prenda this might be one of the most disingenuous bills to ever come to the floor of the house the authors of this bill are talking out of both sides of their mouth today i want to set the record straight in one breath the proponents of this bill say they are protecting female fetuses by preventing abortions based on sex and that we must pass this bill to protect women everywhere and show that girls are as valid as boys yet just last week these same members obstructed the passage of an expanded violence against women act that would have protected all victims of violence the same members who today espouse equality for women voted against the lilly ledbetter fair pay act which will help combat the discrimination against women that keeps them earning 77 cents for every dollar that men earn the same members who today talk about protecting female babies continue to vote to gut the prevention and public health fund which will be used to provide lifesaving breast and cervical cancer screenings to millions of the very women prendas proponents claim to care so much about heres the truth this is not about womens equality prenda is simply another attempt by choice opponents to obstruct womens access to reproductive health care i agree with the bills proponents that abortions based on sex are a problem around the world and i agree that we must take action to stop these abusive practices both at home and around the world but let me be clear that this bill will not prevent sexselective abortions heres why first criminalizing such practices simply will not work banning sexselective abortions has already been tried in various countries around the world and what expert agencies such as the world health organizationwhich operate in these countrieshave found is that these bans dont prevent abortions rather they simply result in a greater demand for clandestine procedures which fall outside regulations protocols and monitoring and basic safety these restrictions serve only to drive these procedures underground making them less safe our own history proves this point second criminalization of sexselective abortions would force physicians to question women about their reasons for seeking abortion it would likely compel physicians to target certain groups of women from cultures where sexselection abortion is more prevalent to avoid liability physicians may even cease providing such care to entire groups of women simply because of their race this bill would promote racial profiling and discrimination additionally targeting such motivations in practice would be nearly impossible according to an analysis by the world health organization and four other u n agencies prosecuting offenders is practically impossible and further proving that a particular abortion was sex selective is equally difficult these expert international organizations do offer a viable solution to address this issue a solution unmentioned in h r 3541 address the root causes which drive individuals to prefer sons over daughters the united nations through its work in nations where sex selection is prevalent has stated that the most effective way to address this son preference is by fighting the root economic social and cultural causes of sex inequality south korea successfully lowered its maletofemale ratio from 116 boys for every 100 girls in the nineties to 107 boys per 100 girls in 2007 they did this by passing laws to improve the legal status of women and by implementing a public education campaign emphasizing the importance of women if were going to consider this bill lets be honest about it its supporters are not promoting womens equality and they are not serious about preventing sexselective abortions if they were they would be promoting programs to empower women and girls to combat son preference instead they are criminalizing physicians profiling cultural groups and driving abortion services underground the truth is that this bill

note that voting for this repeal bill will eliminate the small business health care tax credit this tax credit currently allows small businesses to offset up to 35 percent of their health care insurance cost starting in 2014 the credit will increase to 50 percent of premium cost small businesses have faced outrageous increases in their health care costs over the past decade the affordable care act helps reduce that burden and is already making a real difference in peoples lives nearly 2 million employees at 309 000 small businesses have taken advantage of the tax credit receiving an average credit of 1 400 this repeal bill will put a stop to this important small business tax credit i want to make sure that we all understand that the repeal of the affordable care act will result in a tax increase on small businesses businesses which create almost twothirds of all new jobs in this country lets be clear what the affordable care act does for people and for small businesses the affordable care act prohibits health plans from imposing caps on lifetime and annual coverage it bars cancellation of insurance policies it guarantees free preventative care that lowers the cost of health care it eliminates denial of coverage for preexisting conditions and by eliminating this unfair practice health care reform helps nearly onethird of uninsured selfemployed entrepreneurs but critics of the affordable care act claim that they want to go back to the old system a system where small businesses pay more on average for health insurance than large companies yet receive fewer benefits a system that had small business premiums rising 113 percent over the past decade a system where our country continues to lag behind other advanced nations in delivering timely and effective care and a system where americans spend twice as much as other nations on earth but have worse health outcomes the affordable care act protects the nations 26 million small businesses from unfair premium hikes and ensures that they have predictable and stable cost without the affordable care act outofcontrol costs will only get worse rising to 4 4 trillion by 2018 we cannot go back to business

many medicaid women who get abortions the federal employees health benefits program does not cover abortion i suspectalthough i dont knowthat there are many women covered by the federal employees

obligation by tradition and by the law that the attorney general is duty bound to defend duly constituted laws of the united states so long as he or she can find a constitutional basis for it it is not the purpose nor has it been in the past in democratic and republican administrations for a justice department to arrogate to themselves the responsibility of deciding which laws they like and

had voted against but i could find a constitutional basis for it my real problem with this administration is they strained to find any constitutional basis to not defend that is turning it on its side the point of fact is when the executive branch does not do what they should do it requires us to make a decision as to whether we should now pay for outside counsel that has not been the tradition of the united states this justice department in my judgment based on the experience ive had here in this congress 18 years my years as the chief legal officer of the state of california and 35 or 40 years as a practicing attorney tells me that this administration has fundamentally failed in its obligation to attempt to faithfully carry out the laws of the united states not to wake up every morning and decide i think i can find an unconstitutional basis for a law passed by the congress think of what that would mean it would mean that you have an administration in every instance deciding what laws they want and what laws they dont want that are on the books instead of coming here to the congress and attempting to change what the law is if we believe that we have an obligation when we hold up our hands to uphold the constitution that means we dont just turn over things to the courts and say you decide whether its constitutional we are duty bound to pass what we think are constitutional laws and the administrationof whatever stripeis obligated to attempt to defend those laws unless they cant find a constitutional basis for it not to seek every possible unconstitutional basis so they dont have to defend thats what the problem is here and so while i understand many of the arguments made here and i understand what my friend from ohio saidand i agree with much of what

am humbled to stand in this chamber and engage in debate over such a critical matter as this like the civil rights movement the prolife cause has always been about one of securing rights for those who cannot speak for themselves and who cannot on their own obtain them the fight goes all the way back to our nations beginning what more could our founding fathers have envisioned when they drafted the declaration of independence proclaiming to all that america would hold these truths would be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness there it is the first unalienable right designated by the declaration of independence is our right to life our founding fathers must have deemed this an indispensable right for its placement signifies it was not an afterthought from the start of our great nation until now countless men and women have fought and even sacrificed their own lives to protect that right for others yet in 1973 the unitedstates supreme court issued a decision that has changed the course of history in this country a right that had been protected for nearly 200 years was tossed aside by a court decision to legalize abortion up until that point an unwanted pregnancy was likely to lead to an adoption a process that placed an unwanted child in a caring home the legacy of the late steve jobs reminds us of the impact an adoption can have on the entire world fortunately for us jobs was born 18 years before roe v wade shortly after his birth to a single mother jobs was adopted by a married couple in central california he would go on to be the founder of a tech company that has literally changed the world his was the route of many unexpected children before 1973 maya angelou babe ruth and eleanor roosevelt are just a few of the many adoptees that have transformed the world we live in today unfortunately since roe v wade more and more women are being persuaded that abortion is nothing more than a simple medical procedure that will help them move on with their lives this could not be further from the truth a study of medical patients in california revealed that women who had had an abortion were 160 percent more likely to be admitted for psychiatric treatment than those who had carried the child to term and delivery these women who chose to terminate their pregnancies then had to deal with the psychological devastation that is often associated with such a decision adding harm upon harm abortion is a procedure that brings mental trauma to the mother and irreparable damage to the unborn because of this the policy of the federal government for the last 35 years has been to ban funding for such a procedure studies have shown that when the government subsidizes abortion their number increases the president a supporter of abortion rights has stated his commitment to reducing the amount of abortions in this country restoring the policy of prohibiting federal funds for abortion would be a good first step the american people to a large degree agree with this policy in fact as recently as last year a survey revealed that 67 percent of americans support a ban on abortion funding but the patient protection and affordable care act failed to include this prohibition and that is why we are here today president obama indicated his support for upholding the ban on federal funding for abortion in health reform and that is exactly what the protect life act does the issue of prohibiting taxpayer funds

lot of those operations have either shut down or moved elsewhere to be more competitive weve got to allow job growth i mean it sounds simple it really does you know the last time our country had the amount of spending that we see happening right now was actually in the lead up to world war ii and ive talked a lot about cutting and reducing government overspending and government growth it needs to be done in the last 3 years the what we call discretionary spending the money that has to be appropriated annually has increased by over 80 percent federal employment has increased by 10 percent in about that same time so government spending has grown and people are saying that the way tonot people my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the president are saying that the reason we have stagnant job opportunities is because we havent spent enough well i listed earlier the stimulus the bailouts the auto bailouts the health care bill all this spending thats taken place and were still where we are now and people say well it happened during world war ii we spent a ton of money and then coming out of that we grew jobs the difference the big difference was coming out of world war ii the last time our debt to gdp ratio was near where it is now the difference was and the thing that saved us was the immediate cuts right we cut government spending back but we grew jobs we literally made things here in america you know why we had an environment that fostered job creation we had an environment that cultivated entrepreneurs we grew jobs here in america because we made things here we produced things again in southwest washington we had a roaring timber industry that has all but shut down and the sad thing is if you dont manage the health of a forest it deteriorates some of these folks who are here in these bureaucratic offices in washington d c i swear have never stepped foot in a real forest they think you just tie a big ribbon around it and dont let anybody in or out and thats how we protect our environment theyre wrong you see they think that our environment and our economy are mutually exclusive man that is such a low opinion of american researchers that really must say that we dont think we can our citizens our people are intelligent enough to come up with new and innovative ways to both manage our timber and our timber economy and protect our environment

in that 500 billionplus cutout of the medicare program to help pay for this new entitlement of the patient protection and affordable care act 120 billion of the 500 billionplus was taken from the medicare advantage program the medicare advantage program enrolls about 20 to 25 percent of our medicare beneficiaries why so many we are talking about maybe 11 million or 12 million who sign up and decide that rather than the traditional feeforservice and just pick a doctor out of the yellow pages who accepts medicare its more like a health maintenance organization that emphasizes wellness that emphasizes prevention tests that are not typically covered under traditional feeforservice medicare like colon cancer screening breast cancer screening mammograms for women especially between the ages of 40 and 60 prostate cancer screening for men annual physical examinations followups from a nurse practitioner within the doctors office maybe even on a monthly basis to make sure that the senior is taking the medication that was prescribed by the primary care doctor all of these things are included with medicare advantage thats why its called medicare advantage it is an advantage with very little additional cost in fact people who are under those programs typically dont have to buy supplemental insurance to cover copays and deductibles and hospital care after theyve exhausted their benefits so thats why so many choose that yet what we have done is weve strippedweve guttedthat program so badly that of those 12 million its estimated 7 million of them will lose that coverage under medicare advantage theyll have to get it under the traditional medicare and theyll have to pay 130 a month extra for that supplemental whether they get it through a plan thats endorsed by the american association of retired persons or through some health insurance company but the average cost is going to be an additional 130 a month for those folks so as we talk about the cost i do want to shift to the cost to employers in this next slide where the title says obamacare hurts workers increases costs the majority of employers anticipate health care reform will increase health costs and most say they plan to pass the increases on to their employees88 percent plan to do thator reduce health benefits and programs 74 percent this idea of setting up these exchanges throughout the 50 states and territories and that only 6 million people who have employerprovided health insurance can keep it they wont need to be on the exchanges that is absolute poppycock its probably going to end up being about 130 million people who get their health care provided today by their employer will end up in those exchanges and thats why i say this cost that was estimated by the cbo of 900 billion will be in the trillions because when all of these people morph out of the employerprovided health care onto these exchanges think how many of them will be eligible for a federal subsidy to help them pay for that insurance because the law says the socalled affordable care act that anybody with an income of less than 400 percentnot 100 percent not 200 percent not 300400 percent of the federal poverty levelwhich is getting close to 90 000 for a family of fouri think of my four children and their families of two and three and four and i know what their incomes arethe federal government will be subsidizing so many people that the cost the true cost will be astronomical and it is something that we cannot afford thats why our representative from new york and our other representative from georgia spoke earlier about we cant do this we cant afford to do this we need to repeal this law it is a bad law ive said before that in my humble opinion i think its the worst law that has ever been passed in this congress there have been some folks on the other side of the aislewell not on the other side of the aisle but the more liberal media who took me to task for saying that but i truly believe it i truly believe its one of the worst laws that was ever passed and we have made every effort to repeal it one of the first things we did in the 112th congress was pass h r 2 to repeal obamacare we sent it over to the senate and the senatewhich is controlled by the democratic majority and led by the senator from nevada harry reidjust simply i guess put that in file 13 and h r 2 is sort of dead in the water over on the senate side so what we are doing now it is our obligation because of what the american people have told us over 60 percent of them a year after passage of the bill despite the fact that ms pelosi said once we pass it and you find out whats in it youll like it no they dont they dont like it they dont like it one darn bit better and they wanted us to repeal we made every effort at repeal and now were into plan b plan b of course is to try to defund especially the parts of the bill that are on automatic pilot that we have no control over and when i say we i dont mean the new republican majority in the house of representatives i mean every member of congress100 senators 435 members of the house both sides of the aisle for goodness sakes we ought to have control over the spending this is not a poster i dont have a poster on this one but tomorrow in the energy and commerce committee the committee on which i am proud to serve along with several of our other house gop doctor members we are going to have a markup on several bills to change this automatic pilot spending under obamacare and put it into the more typical discretionary spending where members of congress can say do we want to spend that money and if we do want to spend the money how much do we want to spend and that we have oversight and we can make sure every year that we look at the program and if its not working then defund it and these billsand ill just mention them real quicklyh r 1217 a bill to repeal the prevention and public health fund 17 5 billion that the secretary of health and human services has control over a fund of money that she can spend in any way she wants to you think back to the ads that we saw with andy griffith as the pitchman on television last year about the great value of this new law and how its going to strengthen and improve medicare how you do that by cutting 500 billion out of a program is beyond me but that money that 17 5 billion in this prevention and public health fund can be spent indiscriminately by a decision made by whoever the secretary of health and human services might be h r 1216 h r 1215 h r 1214 and h r 1213 in the aggregate this is over 18 billion worth of spending that we members of congress have no control over were going to get control over it though and were going to defund anywhere we feel that it is wasted duplicative spending that the american people can ill afford i want to go ahead and point out a few other things that are on the slides i mentioned of course the 575 billion in cuts from the medicare program i mentioned the 7 4 million people who will lose that coverage under medicare advantage because of that 126 billion payfor i didnt mention though on this slide the third bullet point many physicians may stop taking medicare patients because reimbursements will be below the cost of providing the care now is that representative phil gingrey from the 11th of georgia is that a statement that ive made well maybe i have made it but im quoting the actuary of medicare richard foster who we had last week as a witness before the energy and commerce committee talking about some of these things this bears repeating many physicians may stop taking medicare patients because reimbursements will be below the cost of providing the care richard foster committee on medicare and medicaid services chief actuary today doctors are reimbursed under the medicare program by a formula an arcane very difficultyou talk about calculus being difficult understanding the sustainable growth rate formula to determine how doctors are reimbursed for providing their service whether its their brain power or their surgical skills is beyond anybodys comprehension and every year for the last 6 or 7 years when you apply that formula to the next years reimbursement level there is a cut from the last years reimbursement2 percent 3 percent 4 percentto the point now what we have done of course we here in the congress have mitigated those cuts and said were not going to enact those cuts because these doctors will not be able to provide the care just as mr foster the actuary said and if we dont put a bandaid on these cuts and mitigate them then the doctors will just drop out of the program and i dont care how much you expand access and hand out more insurance cards if there are no doctors there to see you youre not going to have care you do not have decent careyou dont have any care so in this bill in this new law not only is that formula still there and the doctors are facing a 31percent cut in their reimbursement if we dont mitigate it once again come december 31 of this year not only is that on their backs but in obamacare theres this new provision called ipab this new bureaucracyindependent payment advisory boardthats going to actually cut the doctors even more the actuary is right were not going to have doctors providing the care and thats because weve taken money out of this program and put it into an entirely new entitlement program for the most part for young people some entitlement when you force them to buy health insurance in many instances when they dont

involvement as i think we always should be i think in the past we have been too overanxious to use the unitedstates military in places where it was not a good fit we need to think carefully about this and in every instance we need to strike a balance on the one hand what is the positive impact that our involvement could have and on the other hand what are the risks of that involvement i think there was a unique set of circumstances in libya that made this make sense first of all our involvement could have a very positive impact we had international support the u n nato the arab league everybody in the world wanted qadhafi to be stopped from slaughtering the civilians who were rightfully standing up and asking for the basic rights that we take for granted in this country in addition to that our military budget is roughly equivalent to the entire rest of the worlds combined that gives us a unique set of capabilities that unique set of capabilities was critical to stopping qadhafi from crushing again the legitimate democratic aspirations of the libyan people if we had not acted they would be crushed many more civilians would be dead and qadhafi would be back in power we cannot walk away from that responsibility and say that well yes we dont like qadhafi we wish the people there would do well but we simply dont want to support the action that is necessary to give them that opportunity so in this case i think the mission did make sense for that reason the united states was in the position to make a difference and stand up for people who were asking for legitimate rights but then the broader question is well what does that have to do with the united states that may be true but its true in a lot of countries the reason this is so important is because of the broader movement that is going on the socalled arab spring people in muslim countries rising up and demanding representative rights that has an incredible impact on us the greatest threat that we face as a country right now is from al qaeda and their ideology that ideology arose in part because of a whole bunch of repressive governments across the muslim world that werent providing for their people a

there is no subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency and a very conservativeone of the most respected conservative economists f a hayek said this when one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over 2 000 years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them i have heard over the years people say that we need to have a federal reserve and a federal reserve system in order to prevent depressions and recessions well that is certainly a very very dumb statement to make because the federal reserve was created in 1913 and 16 years later in 1929 we started our greatest depression i think we have had more recessions and more downturns in the economy since the federal reserve was created than we ever had in the entire history of our country before that system was created im not saying that it is a bad system or that its wrong to have some type of federal reserve system but it certainly is one that deserves more attention from the congress and surely it is one that has too much secrecy and too much power in this day and at least the congress needs to look into it more than it has since that system and that board was created"], [0.006607770919799805, 0.5066077709197998, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i think its important to underscore the point and i think the author of the bill would agree that this legislation didnt save the taxpayer one dime thats not what were talking about this bill when you pass it doesnt save one penny every year with respect to the discretionary budget we have appropriations committees in the house and the senate who go through the budgets and they decide whats appropriate and whats necessary to be budgeted for those agencies and those accounts every year they can cut them they can increase them based on the needs that are perceived by members of congress who are acting on that thats not the issue we need to tighten our belts in fact back in august we made some significant savings we need to continue to find savings in fact my view is if were really going to be serious about reducing the deficit and the debt weve got to do this in a balanced way like bipartisan commissions have suggested youve got simpsonbowles youve got rivlindomenici all of them have said weve got to do a combination of cuts and we also need to deal with the revenue we can no longer afford to have tax breaks for the folks at the very top that we cant keep all of these tax loopholes open that disproportionately benefit certain people over others and tax breaks that actually encourage in some cases the export of american jobs when we want to be encouraging the export of american goods and american services so thats a very important debate that we should have but thats not what this does this just has to do with how we present the baseline as to what can be purchased in terms of goods and services for certain dollars and moving to this will create a very misleading perception everyone knows lets say it took a certain amount of money to buy an aircraft carrier today and we wanted to know how much it was going to take to purchase an aircraft carrier 5 years from now lets assume over the next 5 years were in the midst of rising inflation what this would do is create the idea that since the number was the same this year as 5 years from now hey we can buy the same number of aircraft carriers thats not true youre going to get a quarter of an aircraft carrier and that isnt going to do anybody any good so again americans know that when theyre comparing dollars and the value of their dollars over time you have to take into account inflation 1750 it happens every day in terms of financial transactions all over the country so again this bill doesnt save a penny this has to do with just how you present the budget in terms of a picture for the american people to look at and whether its realistic in comparing what you can buy for a dollar today versus what you can buy for a dollar 5 or 10 years from now and what were saying is you should compare apples to apples so people know what the purchasing power of those dollars are in terms of goods and services then we as the congress can decide whether we want to increase that amount or cut it as we do every year but this bill doesnt mandate any kind of cutting of that nature with that i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
