the legislation the ban on assault weapons in the united states of america and i know this is a very difficult issue for a lot of members here today and who are watching back in their offices and it probably should be but it is one i wrestled with quite a while ago as governor of a state and with the governors of new jersey and virginia among others i have called for a ban on assault weapons i have introduced legislation in delaware we have not achieved where i would like to go with that but it was a relatively simple issue working with our police officers and others who believe so strongly in this and i have looked at this legislation and a lot of people will look at this legislation and they will say well we can go beyond this because its going to give the ability to federal officials to ban other kinds of weapons and all variety of arguments come up with respect to that but i think this whole thing is relatively simple and there are just a few points perhaps we should look at as we try to reach our decisions as to whether we are going to vote for this or not first of all and i do not necessarily agree with this but this is a future bill this does not include weapons which people presently own and under which they have control that is a significant point i think in determining whether we should vote for it or not the question then becomes is this an appropriate piece of legislation what are these assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons how are they used well we hear they are used in target practice i do not know of a lot of target practice frankly in which these are used and quite frankly i do not know of a lot of hunting in which these kinds of weapons are used it just is not something which is very prevalent in the united states of america and i suggest we look very carefully at what these weapons are and exactly what their uses are in the united states of america some people have gotten up today and said they have not had any incidents in their districts i hope we do not have to have an incident in a majority of our districts involving an assault weapon before we can pass this legislation the bottom line is that there have been incidents across the united states of america more than incidents of the use of assault weapons there have been a lot of crimes committed with assault weapons in which they have not actually been used let us keep that in mind as well these are expanding in the united states of america our law enforcement officers are strongly for this piece of legislation and i think that is also very very significant they are the

minimums for using weapons in crimes we have truth in sentencing in the state of delaware we have looked at all these issues and my belief is that we can still have those very strong measures i wish we perhaps could have amended this bill to put in some stronger measures with respect to what the penalties would be if one had assault weap ons but the bottom line is that we can be very tough on crime but we canalso be against assault weapons because they expand the crime that we see in the united states of america there was a young man who was caned today by our time in singapore that individual was caned in a city or a state which basically does not allow any weapons at all i tried to find out but i do not know what the penalties there may be but the bottom line is that they have

we look at a recent quote from nicholas christoff who happens to be the beijing bureau chief from the new york times he said it very clearly having traveled throughout the country of a country of between 1 2 and 1 3 billion people he said if you talk with the peasants if you talk with workers in china if you talk with the intellectuals they all unite in one simple statement do not curb trade

is being exported from the united states to the peoples republic of china so jobs are created here in this country and at the same time the relationship that we have with china allows consumers here in the united states to have the chance to purchase goods at prices which are more affordable basically enhancing the standard of living right here in the united states of course having referred to

in the peoples republic of china clearly it has seen improvements steady improvements and the elimination of mostfavorednation trading status i sincerely believe would not only reduce the standard of living for the 1 2 billion people in china but in fact would exacerbate rather than improve the human rights situation there that is why mr speaker i find it absolutely shocking that the leadership on

become part of those that are costing us as taxpayers 32 000 per year to keep them behind bars we have to do some things and we have to do them early so they do not cost us that much we have to do

sophisticated and very effective political operation but the fed does not merely lobby congress it feels its influence is so great and congress so in its thrall that it can bend the truth and mislead us if our questions get uncomfortable or the facts may be embarrassing i recently discovered a particularly illuminating conversation between arthur burns and paul volcker which reveals how the former chairman of the federal reserve and the former president of the new york federal reserve bank respectively plotted and conspired to try to mislead the congress they hoped that by releasing only portions of the federal reserve documents requested by the banking committee that the committee would not notice the omission this subterfuge is revealed in the fomc minutes that federal reserve chairman burns left at the gerald r ford presidential library in ann arbor mi does this sound familiar these were the same tactics the fed used just last year to cover up its records this particular deception was openly discussed during the november 16 1976 fomc meeting at that time the banking committee was trying to obtain 3 years worth of minutes from the board of directors meetings with the 12 federal reserve banks to learn about the immense power that the banking industry wields by way of these federal reserve banks the regional federal reserve banks are run by boards of directors twothirds of whom are elected by the very banks they regulate these directors have great power to regulate the industry that elects them they initiate actions related to bank holding companies such as permission for acquisitions of competing banks and the directors approve federal reserve loans through the discount window to banks in their districts this setup provides fertile ground for possible conflicts of interest since the fed can pass out favors and punishments to those it wants to keep in line for decades the fed has orchestrated and executed a fullscale lobbying effort on capitol hill conscripting the very banks it regulates to act as its chorus this lobbying has been going on for decades but the fed has been able to hide this because the minutes of the directors meetings are pitifully incomplete and not publicly available it is also something the fed camouflages whenever it defends its right to continue regulating the banks and bank holding companies instead of turning these duties over to the new autonomous bank regulatory agency currently being proposed by the administration today the fed promises its flock that it will continue to be the friendly regulatorand that is reason enough to oppose reform the fed does not just lobbyit feels free to lie the transcript of the november 16 1976 fomc meeting reveals that president volcker and chairman burns decided to omit the attachments to the minutes that were delivered to the house banking committee fed governor lawrence k roos asked how do we protect ourselves from the reverse of giving meaningful information to him new york federal reserve bank president volcker said well the important thing to protect here is the attachments to the minutes in our case theyre very long minutes and they include a great many sensitive as well as a great many dull things chairman burns replied well you see if a question were raised about attachment later on then these understandings if they hold and i assure you that ill do everything in my power to achieve that objective that would apply to the attachment the counsel to the chairman of the federal reserve thomas j oconnell then warned that it might be necessary to include some attachments because they are referred to in the minutes if you start including some attachments but not others then to the extent that mr reuss staff is less imaginative than i hope they will be you will ignite imagination of one or another of his numerous troublemakers the 1976 pattern of deception is alive and well today in 1992 i asked for and received minutes of the boards of directors meetings of the 12 federal reserve banks from recent years were complete documents sent what can the public and the congress expect from the federal reserve i have to wonder because the record is not encouraging it is long past time to put an end to the secrecy that allows the federal reserve to escape accountability i recently shared the notes of the burnsvolcker discussion with former house banking committee chairman henry reuss he expressed shock at the fact that the fed attempted to mislead him who can blame him the fed similarly tried to deceive me about its fomc records this is why i am urging you my colleagues to support legislation mandating complete disclosure of what is said at the feds eight annual monetary policy meetings to do any less is to give the fed license to pull the wool over the congress eyes something the central bank is appearently willing to try if the facts are embarassing to the fed my bill h r 28 the federal reserve system accountability act of 1993 requires prompt release of fomc monetary policy changes and timely release of a detailed record of fomc meetings the bill also calls for the gao to examine substantial parts of federal reserve operations which are now restricted from inspection anyone who wants to drop a curtain of secrecy over the kind of stealth the fed engages in does not understand how the fed has abused and misused its privileged position accountability is the first duty of responsibility for as lord acton observed those who need not be accountable eventually become corrupt the material referred to follows tjoc may i urge then that to the extent executive committee minutes would be included that the same right and function of withdrawal and exclusion from those be followed cb oh yes absolutely roos how do we protect ourselves from the reverse of giving meaningful information to him if he has too little information he comes back and says one of two things either were highly say in thecase we do nothing or we are so secretive in our activities that we dont dare put down our nefarious activities i mean it seems to me hes got us either way if he wants to play that game and i dont know it cb well i dont know if there is any protection and i would not be at all surprised if a byproduct of this fishing expedition turned out to be a strong recommendation by mr reuss possibly by his entire committee possible a piece of legislation that he would introduce as to the character of minutes i would not be surprised in the future first a condemnation and then laying the basis you see for this request as to the future well gentlemen thats the kind of world we live in and i dont think that this environment in which we function that its going to change very quickly nor am i ready to predict that its going to improve this year any question comment criticism of this procedure i havent sent this letter yet bartee i would consider it very fortunate if you can get it off and get it acceptedvolcker well the important thing to protect here is the attachments to the minutes in our case theyre very long minutes and they include a great many sensitive as well as a great many dull things cb well you see if a question were raised about attachments later on then these understandings if they hold and i assure you that ill do everything in my power to achieve that objective that would apply to the attachments in other words if lets say reuss asks later on for the attachment these categories of exclusion and separate filings it wouldthese attachments would be handled in exactly the same way as the body of the minutes but lets not anticipate too much there is still ive said this 3 4 5 times already theres still a possibility mr reuss will acquire other interests in the course of the year one of the difficulties of course here is you know thats part of the world we live in mr reuss may well acquire other interests he has a very large staff i think theyve put in long hours thinking up ways you see of harassing etc volcker the trouble is hes got a big enough staff so one of them could make this his personal interest cb oh yes tjoc before closing may i touch on a matter that mr volcker has remarked about the attachments again its quite possible that a board of directors minutes will contain a reference to that boards recent action in recommending a discount rate for the board and the boards response thereto attached as exhibit a its quite possible thats the very type of attachment you would want to exhibit to mr reuss consistent with the position youve taken all along with respect to the roll that the bank directors play in this action of monetary policy so that at the very outset we may be including specific attachments as we review these minutes i didnt cb well lets think very carefully about that if you start including some attachments but not others then to the extent that mr reuss staff is less imaginative than i hope they will be you will ignite imagination of one or another of his numerous troublemakers tjoc in a way youve done that when youve included the executive committee minutes cb well executive committee meetings are different as i think that mr volcker explained that better than i did that there are executive committee functions for the board and at times meetings of the executive committee are virtually indistinguishable from fall board meetings tjoc all right sir cb any thing else gentlemen on this weve had two unsavory subjects for discussion and if there is no further question or comment lets drink coffee and that

committed to responsible stewardship of the black lung benefits program and with its basic purpose as a workers compensation program something of which i think we lost sight of from time to time designed to provide payments to disabled miners based on a clear showing of employmentrelated medical disability unfortunately h r 2108 would move the program far beyond congressional intent concerning the black lung benefits act and indeed move us backward to the 1970s most of the people by now have forgotten that this 1 5 billion per year program was a lastminute addition indeed an afterthought to the 1969 federal coal mine health and safety act a law concerned primarily with the technical safety requirements of coal mines so it was that congress with minimal debate or consideration tacked a rider on to the coal mine health and safety act and created the black lung benefits act a workers compensation act the original black lung act was limited limited in duration limited to underground coal miners who could establish that they were totally disabled as defined only in regard to being totally disabled to work in the mines only not totally disabled in general due to black lung disease arising out of coal mine employment and limited to governmental liability also but as we have seen before federal entitlement programs can attain a life and a momentum all of their own in 1972 congress decided that not enough miners were receiving black lung benefits and the socalled temporary act was suspended to cover surface miners and special presumptions were added so that miners were considered to have black lung disease simply because of the number of years that they worked in the mines and the act ordered the review of all prior denials some 70 000 claimants had their claims reversed resulting in an additional 9 billion over the lifetime of those claimants of expense to the black lung trust fund which is set up to be able to respond insofar as illness from black lung is concerned from owners of coal companies by congress is in tragic shape right that no longer can be found now and along comes h r 2108 what in 1977 congress does it do it goes back to the 1970s to proved that it could make things the good old days and it says we will worse the 1977 amendments gave a bring back irrebuttable presumptions new meaning to the concept of retro of eligibility we will bring back reactive liability congress again sought strictions of evidence that the black to ease the burden on claimants seek lung recoveries would again not necing benefits so that all of the claims essarily have to be based on actual which were reviewed initially under proof of total disability and that is a the 1969 act and rereviewed under the disservice i say to the miners who 1972 amendments were to be reviewed really are deeply sick because of black yet again under the 1977 amendments lung disease thus these miners are the 1977 amendments created 125 000 not thus getting the benefits they declaims to be refiled and relitigated serve because of the avalanche of all which caused workers compensation these claims being relitigated and insurance companies by the way to relitigated time and time again when deny liability for the claims they were some members of congress and some insuring because they said hey we unions do not like the results of black only really insured one bite at the lung workers compensation litigation apple in litigation not several more so in 1972 congress ordered relitigawhich caused the trust fund to go deep tion of black lung cases and they atly into debt and caused the coal compa tempted to doctor the legal procedures nies much consternation because they to get better results in 1977 they did had to selfinsure for black lung liability and that set the stage for 1981 the same thing ordering 125 000 the thus in 1981 the administration right to relitigate their black lung labor and management agreed on a cases which they had lost all of this of compromise set of amendments to the course is tremendously expensive and black lung act in order to stabilize cloggs up the adjudication process programs and to hopefully steer the what are we doing trust fund toward financial stability we are saying that interim benefits for by late 1981 it was clear that funding total disability need never be repaid arrangements enacted in 1978 were so even if the claim is denied even if it is inadequate that the trust fund had ac admitted that there was no basis for cumulated 1 5 billion of debt to the the claim a survivor widow is entitled unitedstates taxpayers with no prospect of fu to the irrebuttable presumption that ture solvency death of the miner was caused by in 1981 congress pneumoconiosis if the miner was topassed amendments which doubled the tally disabled at his death regardless tax on coal to provide additional in of what really caused come for the trust fund and repealed death he might have committed suirepealed most of the cide he might have had an accident it presumptions and the restrictions on does not matter automatically we exevidence passed in 1969 1972 and 1978 tend these benefits designed to make proof of real medical that means there is less for the ones illness that much easier who really really need it the purpose of the 1981 amendments the rules of evidence was to ensure that entitlement of what do we do here the rules of eviclaims filed in the future would not be dence in black lung cases allow claimbased on presumptions of eligibility ants to put three medical examinations and restrictions of evidence but on ac into evidence while the trust fund this tual proof of total disability due to is the peoples insurance company black lung disease arising from em congress insurance company and the ployment in the coal industry responsible operators the coal operaby the way about 12 000 claims tors can only offer one medical examagainst the coal operators were trans ination you can always ferred over to the trust fund because of find one doctor to be able to express the enormous responsibilities that your opinion all right the opinion of were involved because of those 1977 the miners treating physician shall b6 amendments which kind of rigged and get this given substantial weight over that is not possibly the best way of ex the opinions of other physicians in depressing it but changed the mode of termining the claimants eligibility procedure for approving these claims that is a cost by the way of 22 milthe result of the 1981 lion the interim benefits a cost of 56 amendments was that the growth of million new and the survivors widow the trust fund dramatically slowed but case to which i referred to 7 5 million it did not stop so today the trust fund we did not stop there is approaching 4 billion of debt all of with this legislation there is more the tax revenues which wereincreased there is also extended coverage we in 1981 are sufficient yes to cover ben are going to make the black lung benefit outlays now and are sufficient to efits act extend farther and farther cover administration expenses now but and wider and much more coverage we not interest on the debt so even with are going to be covering coke oven the 1981 reforms the trust fund now is workers nobody knows how many 4 billion in debt and growing coke oven workers might be involved the insurance com under the definition of coke oven workpany known as the trust fund operated ers as set forth in this bill cbo makes the stab 11 million more of costs but nobody really knows we also redefine the definition of pneumoconiosis to include obstructive lung disease as well as restrictive lung disease what does that mean basically it means that a style of life for instance if someone smokes too much and has respiratory problems is no defense we are going to just compensate all of those people too who happen to have had any experience in the mines then for attorney fees we also allow attorney fees and expert witness fees and costs even if the claim is denied we will say that even though a claim is denied one gets attorney fees by the way under those circumstances who pays for the attorney fees for the coal operators guess what the peoples insurance company the trust fund of course i do not have any problems with attorney fees being ordered i think it is a big problem in the black lung act because a lot of very competent attorneys are not in there fighting for the miners to the degree they ought to and i support the concept that there ought to be legal fees awarded i would even go so far as to say that unlike all the other workers compensation statutes that the fee does not have to come out of the recovery although that is generally true in the states where they have a contingent fee arrangement in workmens compensation cases i will go along with that even i think also that if we really wanted to do some progress in regard to getting these cases over with we would have contingent fees on recovery the way the state do and the way basically tort law and injury law is worked those are just my opinions i think it would help a great deal the only thing i say is no no i do not think anybody in this congres s believes that legal fees should be awarded when the claim is denied i do not think anybody believes that legal fees when the claim is denied then have to be shifted over to the trust fund so what in reality does h r 2108 do as i have said it goes back to the 1970s it treats the black lung benefits act more as an entitlement program to total disability payments not a workers compensation act you cannot go on refiling years and years and thousands and hundreds of thousands of claims over the years simply because you do not like the results that the department of labor is giving to you or the administrative judges you know what that does out in the private fndustry it is absolute chaos yet in h r 2108 there is another requirement that some 87 000 miners may nowafter have had their day in court and their claimn denied can refile anyone who lost 11 s or her case since 1981 can refile their claim and cbo says that at least 20 000 new awards will result frombeing able to relitigate under changed rules of evidence well it does not bother congress because we just go along with those things but let me tell you anybody trying to run a coal business and trying to find anybody who might want to insure for workmens compensation you have a tough time when the insurance company says well congress may go and just cause us to relitigate four or five times well that is one of the things that we are doing it is a trust fund buster it is made to order for more massive bailouts if without the new requirements of 2108 the trust fund has added 2 5 billion to its debt since 1981 and has gone up to 4 billion what do you think the new debt will be with all of these new costs and gimmicks and ways of rearranging rules of evidence in trials this bill totally ignores the spirit of the requirements of paygo by refusing to offset the new costs by cutting elsewhere but really paygo and cbo only look ahead for 5 years and i am telling you that is not where the big debt here is we ought to in congress in operating this particular insurance company known as the trust fund we ought to be setting up reserves which would therefore guarantee that we would have the money without having to be bailed out by the taxpayers again in the future when these miners who have lifetime rights to total disability payments come along and ask for their payments in truth the full cost of this bill will be so immense over the years that the offsets that cbo is talking about and they have suggested that there would be 195 5 million of paygo violations here but that is not going to alleviate the concern that i think the administration has nor do i think it is going to alleviate the concerns that all of the rest of us have in fact in closing let me say that h r 2108 creates more inequities in the blacklung program than it corrects and would substantially increase expenditures for black lung benefits as i said it is a black lungfund buster but do not take my word for it let us look at omb and what does omb say about it i do not know if the administration has endorsed this bill yet i do not think they have at least it has been relatively quiet but even omb recoils and here is what they say the administration is very concerned about the enormous debt in the blacklung disability trust fund and the additional debt that would result from those revisions and the actuary with whom i have been working to determine what the ultimate costs will be has estimated that on the basis of dol estimates that there will be the 80 000 refilings that on the basis of 80 000 refilings which this bill requires that you would have a lifetime cost of approximately 225 000 per case lifetime total disability obligation you multiply that by 10 000 which would be roughly the share of cases attributable to the trust fund and you have got there alone 2 2 billion if we were a true insurance company we would be putting out in reserves to make sure we are not going to bankrupt the future and can pay for those 10 000 new cases but we are not going to be doing that that does not even include the added costs in h r 2108 to which we will be addressing ourselves with our amendments that does not by the way include either what the private sector is going to have to absorb and the same actuary has stated that there we are talking about many billions of dollars upon the private sector which as a practical matter probably will have to be handled by new taxes which is what senator simon is talking

report the most important is that further delay in implementing esea will adversely impact the children who benefit most from the programs funded in this bill given the problems encountered in bringing this bill to fruition once again the perception given the public is that the congress unable to deal with the criticaland basic issues facing this nation we seem eager to respond to minutia and frivolous matters of little consequence to most americans but when it comes to the welfare of our children we seem to be unable to do what is necessary to ensure their future 0 the peoples agenda includes economic development crime abatement education and health reform the conference committee has tried to be responsive those who would thwart such efforts appear to have a different agenda which speaks to special interests like baseball hockey term limits and bogus election year con tracts h r 6 the improving americas schools act of 1994 extends through 1999 almost all of the major federal elementary and secondary education programs since its inception in 1965 this act has provided a vital and crucial link in helping to provide highquality education to economically disadvantaged children particularly in the areas of reading and mathematics as well as in the development of critical thinking skills the move toward excellence and inclusiveness which began so nobly in 1965 when then president lyndon baines johnson signed the elementary and secondary education act into law must be permitted to move forward the dwight d eisenhower professional development component of this

desegregation a recent report on school desegregation issued in december 1993 by gary orfield states for the first time since the supreme court declared school segregation in the south unconstitutional in 1954 the public schools in that region have turned back toward greater segregation clearly in reauthorizing the magnet schools assistance program we can demonstrate our continuing commitment to school desegregation in compliance with the 1954 supreme court decision in brown versus board of education the opportunitytoleam standards provisions included in this legislation clearly provides for content and performance standards as well as assessments that would be established or used for title i programs content standards indicate what children should know and be able to do performance standards determine whether children are learning i fully support both content and performance standards however i firmly believe that it is inequitable to hold students accountable for their performance without addressing the capacity of the school to educate children to the level required under the student performance standards the legislation is needed in order to enrich and expand educational opportunity for children and youths at all levels the reality is that title 1 and the other programs included in this legislation are crucial if we are to provide world class education for our children lets do the peoples business and give our youth a fighting chance to be productive adults i urge my colleagues to hear the people to do what is right and vote in favor of
