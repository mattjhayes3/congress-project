to the legislative process ensuring that members of congress are held accountable for their requests by requiring a list of earmarks and their sponsors to accompany every bill and conference report considered by the house we will deter wrongful behavior and give the public a better view of what their elected officials are doing in washington full disclosure will enable our constituents to decide whether spending requests are justified and whether they serve the public interest i have long advocated for this important reform and i am glad the house is acting on it republicans in the house have a strong record of implementing ethics reform this rule change governing earmarks represents a great improvement over the current system and is another example of our partys leadership on ethics reform at this time i request unanimous consent to place in the record an oped i wrote on the subject i am hopeful that we will continue to implement additional reforms including greater public disclosure of lobbying activities and continue to uphold the integrity of the house i am glad this resolution has been brought to the floor and urge my colleagues to support it"],

family is to vote for the davis amendment which will allow him and other cuban american families to go see their families better than once every 3 years i think sergeant lazo says it best he says cubans pray every day that their parents die 3 years apart if their parents are in cuba so they are able to go see them who are we who are we as americans to tell other americans that they should only be able to go and see their family their mother their father or their kids in this case once every 3 years what kind of policy is that again i am not able to offer this amendment it is going to be

legislation which would renew the freedom and democracy act of 2003 for burma and the import restrictions that are contained in that important legislation as my colleagues know burma today remains one of the most repressive military dictatorships in the world where human rights are routinely and systematically repressed and violated so it is fitting and necessary that congress today is moving to renew this im7 portant legislation the burmese dictatorship today incarcerates 1 400 political prisoners and continues to harass and repress one of the bravest leaders of our time nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi who by the way turned 60 this past weekend i like many other members in this body have tried to get into burma to press for human rights and my visa like others has been turned down denying member of congress the opportunity to even meet with the military junta that continues to repress its citizens up to 70 000 child soldiers are exploited in burma more than any other country in the world up to 2 million people have been forced to flee the country as refugees and migrants burning ofvillages continues in eastern burma especially in karen and karenni states and aung san suu kyi continues to be persecuted and harassed by this brutal dictatorship sanctions do work i say to my colleagues but they often take time other countries im happy to say are beginning to follow the lead of the united states in a major and important move the european union in october 2004 followed the lead of the united states and significantly strengthened its sanctions in burma including a ban on investments in enterprises of the ruling regime and a strengthened visa ban the eu also pledged to join the united states in opposing loans to burmas regime from the international monetary fund and the world bank support at the united nations is growing as well burma was one of the few countries on the resolutions list that passed at the united nations commission on human rights i was there in geneva working that resolution as well as resolutions on cuba sudan and belaurus and it was as one of the few that made it through after the united states senate and the house passed resolutions in october 2004 calling on the security council to address the situation in burma the parliament df australia followed suit their motion called on the government to support the burmese national league for democracys call for the u n security council to convene a spe cial session to consider what further measures the u n can take to encourage democratic reform and respect for human rights in burma additionally the european parliament passed a resolution calling on the u n security council to address the situation in burma as a matter of urgency additionally 289 members of our friends in the british parliament tabled a motion calling on the u n security council to address the situation in burma there has even been unprecedented action within the asean countries whereas in the past they refused to even comment on what they deemed to be burmas internal affairs many members of that organization are now publicly pressing burma to step aside as the chair of the association in 2006 the tough approach maintained by the unitedstates toward burma including import sanctions and a possible boycott of 2006 meetings is encouraging many asian countries to rethink whether the burmese regime should assume that rotating chairmanship there is widespread belief within the leadership of the asean countries that burma has failed and failed miserably to deliver on its promises to the region all in all and i point to these abovementioned instances the strong stand of the united states and i commend president bush and former president clinton because both have been united in their belief that burma needs to be sanctioned and isolated in a way that hopefully leads to reform and change moreover our resolution to promote freedom and democracy in burma has stiffened

white house and when it comes down to what this republican majority does it is 2 000 from what the 911 commission called for and what we called for as house democrats versus the presidents proposal and you can look it up on line that only asks for 210 agents democrats fought for the funding on almost five different occasions again for the record ms wasserman schultz h r 1268 a motion to recommit and 2 000 vote number 160 and that happened on 5 5 05 also you look at house bill 2360 was blocked it was an obey amendment vote number 174 that was on 5 17 05 it failed 223 to 185 on a partisan vote h r 1817 a motion to recommit 2005 again vote number 188 again failed on partisan lines you start talking about on border security and closing the gaps on nine separate occasions over the last 5 years democrats put forth motions here on this floor because that is the only thing we can do being in the minority we are not able to bring the bills to the floor because the majority is blocking those bills from getting out of committee and they are noted right here and i am not going to go through that at this particular time but all of this is on line housedemocrats gov if anyone wants to go on and get this information also when you start talking about aviation security democrats offered a motion to require air cargo to be screened within 3 years the motion was rejected by republicans again 2005 vote number 188 5 18 05 democrats have spoken repeatedly on the issue of transit security making sure that we authorize including a 2 8 billion initiative to improve transit security and a 1 billion initiative to improve rail security substitute amendment defeated again so when you start look looking at the record and what the record says versus what is said here on the floor by the republican majority and the rubber stamp majority i wish the rubber stamp republican majority would stop fighting us and start saying to the president guess what we no longer want to rubber stamp everything that you send here i just wish the republican majority would just leader up and say hey mr president so you start reading the paper could someoneget me a newspaper please because i want to just have it as a prop because as americans start reading the paper they are reading about how republican members of the house and the senate the president flies into town they get on the plane and leave town some even get in their car and go i was on the other side of my district well let me tell you something if the president of the united states is in my district i think i would know i think it would be some sort of news flash or some sort of email that would come to me and say you know the president is coming in your district today will be in an elementary school maybe you want to be there he is the leader of the free world maybe you want to be there the reason why they are taking flights while the president is coming in the reason why they are finding something else to do while the president is in their town is the fact that they dont want to be caught in the same situation with the president of the united states because they have not stood up to the president and said no you cant put us in a financial situation as far as the eye can see as it relates to deficits and foreign countries running the world you cant pick up the paper today not talking about a republican running from the president of the united september 12 2006 co states and dont want to be around when the president is around or explaining why they are not there that is some excuse i hope i never get to the situation where i have the president of the united states coming into my district and i have to explain that i am somewhere else while the president is there and the bottom line is this people cannot face the music when it comes down to dealing with the policies of this administration and better yet you being in the position there is only 535 of us being in the position as i come in for a landing ms wasserman schultz to be able to bring about change on behalf of the american people to say this is not going to happen to say i know you want to start a war in iraq but we still got this business over here with al qaeda who had everything to do with 9 11 who trained the individuals that carried out the 9 11 plot but meanwhile while we are over therelooking for osama bin laden and we have him cornered i got this unfinished business the president said over here in iraq because i got a problem with this leader over here we got to take him out but what about the after player what is going to happen once you get to baghdad how are you going to bring stability who is going to be in the coalition calling up a couple of friends ill send 25 troops ill send 30 troops you are not allowed to talk about it everything is secret we have the then sitting attorney general comes to the unitedstates congress over on the senate side and tells the senate you are either with us or you are with the terrorists 0l 2340 what kind of mess is that so when it comes down to article i section 1 and if the american people want the kind of representation they need i am not talking as a democrat even though we were given an hour by the deqiocratic leader and we are all members of the democratic caucus this is america i guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot ms wasserman

5 was constitutional only because it was narrowly tailored and temporary i would suggest to my colleagues here in the house that 40 years is more than temporary now congress is considering extending
