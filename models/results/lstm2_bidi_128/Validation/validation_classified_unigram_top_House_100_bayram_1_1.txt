for this country to start again to construct a road tc peace in that region as part of this effort 2 weeks ago the gentleman from michigan mr crockett chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs and i introduced house concurrent resolution 146 to applaud the arias peace initiative this resolution is similar to that passed by the senate on march 12 1987 by a nearly unanimous vote of 971 hearings on our resolution will be held tomorrow and next week the timing of this resolution of support even more than its wording is significant because of the postponement 2 weeks ago of the central american summit and the general assumption that the arias initiative appears to be faltering empty words of support for that vital effort to end armed conflict in central america are not enough we must put some substance behind our rhetoric so that other nations in the world understand that we are sincere in supporting efforts toward peace we must reevaluate our policies in central america and ask ourselves whether they are furthering peace or war do we truly desire a negotiated settlement or does this country really prefer a military solution construction of this road to peace will never begin unless the united states is willing to stop military aid to the nicaraguan contras it is time to realize that our policies in central america have helped the sandinistas more than they have hurt them and have hurt this country more than they have helped in reaching our objectives at first we were told that aid to the contras was designed to stop arms shipments going from nicaraguan to the rebels in el salvador but when the nicaraguans reduced aid to the salavadoran rebels in early 1981 the administration responded that the revised objectives were to place pressure on the sandinistas for a negotiated settlement that remains the official goal as i understand it as time went on however it became apparent that the purpose in aiding the contras was really to overthrow the sandinista government in fact president reagan with uncharacteristic candor in an interview last august stated if nicaragua wont see the light then the only alternative is for the freedom fighters to have their way and take over which the presidents spokesman subsequently called an ulp timate goal but it has become more and more apparent with the passage of time that this war is unwinnable by the contras and most everybody agrees that this is true the presidents of all four central american democracies have so stated in my presence the question i would like answered is how sincere is the administration in its officially stated goal to assist in a negotiated settlement former ambassador to honduras john ferch a long time backer of the administrations policies in nicaragua stated last year i always thought we meant what we said we wanted pressures so we could negotiate im beginning to think i accepted something that wasnt true our goal is something different its a military goal where has our contra policy led us have we stopped arms shipments to the salvadoran rebels has the sandinista government been overthrown has it become more humane has our bargaining chip helped to achieve peace have the contras with our support won any military objective the answer is no in fact our policies have almost certainly had the reverse effect to gain perspective here it is important to recall that the united states stands alone in the world in militarily supporting the contras in fact none of our allies even agrees with our policy that fact alone should cause us to question its correctnessthis policy which has led us to violate international law and to ignore the international justice system why is it that we have not learned from our experience in vietnam that ambivalent american unilateral efforts at military solutions are doomed to failure one must question the morality of our contrinued support of the contras during my 4day trip last february to the region costa rican president oscar arias sanchez asked our congressional delegation this key question if the contras have no chance of winning then is it not immoral to give them aid to carry on their fight isnt it immoral to send men to nicaragua to kill and be killed in an unwinnable war that is the question that i kept asking myself as i talked with the 15yearold contra revolutionary in honduras he was certain this boy soldier that with american support his life was not in danger and they would throw the sandinistas out this young guerrilla fighter a mere boy and i emphasize mere genuinely believed that his rag tag group of at most 17 000 contras could defeat the 62 000 man sandinista army yet the contras do not have the apparent support of the nicaraguan countryside they have not won the hearts and the minds of the nicaraguan people nevertheless these men these good basically decent naive peasant fighting troops were convinced they could win the war because of one thing their powerful northern yankee neighbor was on their side one must further question the morality or more appropriately the immorality of recent cia actions newspapers in march reported that the cia was providing the contras with precise information on dams bridges electrical substations and ports and counseling them in sabotage methods so that the contras could destroy those vital facilities imagine that the very projects constructed in the 1960s and 1970s by a benevolent wellintentioned american army corps of engineers to help these impoverished people provide for their food and water and electricity needs these same projects are now 10 years later to be destroyed sacrificed to help politically destabilize that region of nicaragua all this under the direction of the same american government that built them in the first place do you think the nicaraguan peasants understand that maneuver can any defensible american goal be furthered by that course of action reason and justice are turned upside down judgement william shakespeare quotes mark antony as saying millenia ago oh judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason in january 1983 columbia mexico panama and venezuela met on the island of contadora in panama to begin to build a foundation toward peace as international support for the contadora initiative grew the united states consistently showed support for the process while warning that nicaragua would never agree as final drafts were distributed we learned that the nicaraguan government was in fact ready to sign and just as suddenly the unitedstates support for the contadoran initiative disappeared and american diplomats methodically began to undermine this balanced plan for peace the reagan administration in 1985 and 1986 in fact conducted a secret campaign in latin america to scuttle the contadora peace talks a number of carefully documented news stories and thoughtful articles including a secret national security council paper published by the washington post provide strong evidence of that point the administration had misled the public and congress into believing it supported contadoras efforts at peace while secretly blocking the peace initiative the administration was successful talks have been totally stalled since june of last year last february a new shortened set of proposed principles for a settlement of armed conflicts in central america was proposed to a central american summit conference by costa rican president arias leaders of central americas four democracies made positive steps toward agreeing on that formula for peace while they did not agree on the specific plan they did sign the preamble as a sign of support and agreed to meet in esquipulas guatemala 4 months later nicaragua which was not invited to the february meeting accepted an invitation to meet in june astoundingly the political leadership of the nicaraguan contras themselves supported the arias initiative the united states indicated an initial interest and still publicly expresses limited support but increasingly has given the impression that it is interfering and trying to stall the central american peace efforts two weeks ago for example which was 1 week before the scheduled summit and 1 day after united states ambassador phillip habibs visit to el salvador president duarte asked to postpone the planned summit just a few days later the administration summoned president arias to washington and sharply criticized his proposal president arias and his fellow central american presidents have all along been paving the way toward peace taking the lead after the united states effectively stalled the contadora talks now these leaders appear a little discouraged i think we should be applauding and encouraging their efforts toward a negotiated settlementnot blocking them we should let the central american nations determine their own destiny so long as our own security is not threatened we have no moral right to interfere with that process the administration has criticized the arias proposal as being too lenient on the sandinistas the administration fears that if united states aid to the contras stops the nicaraguan government will not implement democratic reforms notwithstanding the terms of the settlement yet let me point out that the civil war with the contras and americas support to the contras are the sole excuses that the nicaraguan government had used to justify suppressing basic democratic rights and no one should pretend in my view that the sandinista government is genuinely less dictatorial nor substantively more democratic than its predecessor though many americans will not agree with me on that point genuine abuses by bothsides are abundantly documented do you think that the nicaraguan peasant who is subjected to inhumane treatment by the sandinista government and remembers comparable atrocities by the somozan government while today witnessing similar contra abuses genuinely cares who wins the fight will he prefer an authoritarian government of the political right to one of the political left through the arias plan withdrawal of united states aid to the contras will put the nicaraguan government to the test we will find out if it is sincere about bringing about these democratic reforms if it does not abide by the agreement the united states gives up none of its present options including the military ones the contras will continue their struggle at least initially they survived for years without american assistance we will also then be joined by the rest of the free world in pressuring the nicaraguan government to abide by the agreements terms this is much to be preferred to our current position of opposing the rest of the world in militarily assisting the contras there are no ideal options in central america there are only gradations of unappealing choices the arias plan in my opinion is not perfect while it would require democratic reforms and arms reductions it does not contain the stronger provision of the contadora principles requiring the withdrawal of soviet union assistance from nicaragua nor contra participation in the negotiating process i wish it did but we must realize that the failure of the contadora process changed the negotiating landscape in central america the arias plan is the first step and only apparent hope for a negotiated settlement of the armed conflict if the sandinista government does not implement the arias provisions of arms reductions democratic reforms and an end to the armed conflict in nicaragua they will be exposed before the world as liars isolated by free world public opinion and pressure will increase for compliance the imperative now is to bring the central american nations to the negotiating table and the arias initiative is the stimulus to start that peace process will this country support a negotiated settlement to the armed conflicts in nicaragua and central america or will we continue to seek a military solution i am confident that the congress will insist on the peace process of negotiation among the central american parties themselves"], [0.48488521575927734, 0.5151147842407227, 1, "mr speaker i thank the gentleman from california for yielding me this time as cocharman of the human rights caucus tand him self one of the principal leaders in this country and indeed on the entire national scene on behalf of human rights everywhere i am proud to be assoclat ed with him and with others who support this resolution mr speaker on november 7 of this year the government of the soviet union celebrated the 70th anniversary of the bolshevik revolution the attention of the world media was focused and justly so on that event and particularly on the november 2 statement by generalsecretary gorbachev concerning issues facing the soviet government and its people in this connection i would like to mention another anniversary that will be commemorated shortly by the people of latvia whose land is currently occupied by soviet forces november 8 1987 will mark the 69th anniversary of the declarationof latvian independence beginning in 1918 the latvian people enjoyed 22 years of independ ence having successfully rejected foreign occupiers from east and west to establish a stable prosperous nation on the baltic sea then in 1939 came the deal between fstalin and hitlera deal which brought death destruction and the tragic status of captive nations to the formerly free baltic states of estonia latvia and lithuania the citizens of latvia and ofithelr two fellow baltic states were robbed of their independence obviously this november anniversaxy will not be officially celebrated by the soviet government which contin ues to claim despite all evidence to the contrary that the latvian people voluntarily entered the soviet union and enjoy their current status as a soviet republic latvian national and civil rights activists who dare to challenge this version of soviet history have been imprisoned or forced into exile in order to help eradicate the latvian culture and national identity the soviet government encourages nonlatvian immigrants to move to latvia as a result the latvian language has been relegated to secondclass status compared to russian thelatvian lutheran church which was the national church during the years of independence has been reduced to a state of virtual spiritual impotence its own hierarchy suborned to the will of an alien power both in the spiritual and political sense but thelatvan people have not forgotten their past nor have they surrendered their future on june 14 of this year approximately 5 000 persons gathered at the freedom monument n latvias capital city riga to honor the memory of latvians deported to siberia in 1941 by stalin on august 23 the 48th anniversary of the signing of the m0lotovribbentrop treaty nearly 10 000 latvians attended a peaceful demonstration at the same site to demand that moscow renounce that death warrant for their unfortunate nation we understand that latvian citizens plan once more to meet at the monument of freedom on november 18 and peacefully commemorate their nations lost independence we are also informed that local authorities are threatening criminal charges against anyone who appears in the area of the monument of freedom there are also reports that localfactory directors are recruiting party thugs to act as outraged workers and provoke violence at the planned gathering as the soviet constitution does provide soviet citizens with the right to peaceful assembly and as the soviet government does insist that the people of latvia are indeed soviet citizens we hope that these reports of illegal measures being considered by the authorities are incorrect i have also been informed that an other group of latvians plan to fpeacefully demonstrate in front of the old embassy of independent latvia in moscow on the same day as their fellow citizens in riga the iparticipants have stated that they intend to observe latvian independence protest the continued soviet occupation and publicize the latviansoviet treaty of august 11 1920 in which the soviet union pledged to respect latvian nde pendence in perpetuity in july 1986 members of the latvian human rights group he sinki 86

communist ideology than to try and artificially force the historical process or to try to interfere with it let us hope that mr voss message is not lost on the kremlin the true historical process in the baltics was tragically and savagely trampled under soviet tanks in the spring of 1940 as chairman of the helsinki commission i call upon the soviet government to uphold principle vii of the

affairs for the gentlemans leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor i also want to pay tribute to the gentleman from ohio our very good friend who had originally introduced this resolution some months ago i should also take note of the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle who worked very closely with us in redrafting this resolution to faithfully reflect the concerns of members on both sides of the aisle i have in mind in particular the gentleman from new york who served with great distinction over three decades ago in a conflict on the korean peninsula and who has taken a very special interest in the problems of that country ever since i should also mention the gentleman from california who also played a helpful role in shaping the text of this resolution and of course the gentleman from michigan the very distinguished ranking minority member on the committee on foreign affairs this resolution house concurrent resolution 141 reaffirms the commitment of the united states to the security of the republic of korea at the same time it also calls upon the government and the democratic opposition in south korea to enter into a dialog in a spirit of good faith in an effort to resolve the problems that currently confront that country most importantly of all the resolution affirms the very strong sense of the house of representatives and of the congress of the united states that this is the time in the history of the republic of korea for a transition from dictatorship to democracy over the course of the last 25 years south korea has experienced what can only be characterized as a veritable economic miracle during that period of time the per capita income of the average korean has gone from 100 to over 2 000 a year in the last year south korea experienced a 121 2 percent real growth from an economic point of view south korea has been the envy of developing countries all over the world it is a nation which enjoys universal literacy that has more college students per capita than any nation in the world other than the united states yet precisely because of this enormous economic and educational growth and the emergence of a large middle class the people of south korea want the benefits of full freedom and this is why over the course of the last few weeks tens of thousands of koreans led by students who are considered the conscience of the country but also supported by the middle class have called upon their government to permit the establishment of genuine democracy this resolution calls for the establishment of freedom of the press for the release of all political prisoners for the cessation of torture of detainees for the creation of a truly independent judiciary and for the establishment of a political system in south korea which will reflect the will and wishes of the korean people i think that all of the members recognize that south korea is a country in which the united states has very significant strategic interests forty thousand american troops stand watch just south of the demilitarized zone as a tangible manifestation of our historical commitment to the defense and security of south korea we have a mutual security treaty with south korea should south koreans once again be the victims of aggression if there were another war on the korean peninsula our forces would inevitably instantaneously be involved as a consequence we have a stake in the political stability of south korea just north of that country north korea has 750 000 wellarmed and welltrained troops deployed just north of the demilitarized zonetroops that could if there should be widespread instability in south korea launch another war against the south in an effort to reunify the korean peninsula the dictator of north korea kim iisung has made no secret of his ambition to reunify the korean peninsula under the control of the communists it is by no means inconceivable that he might decide that the time has come to make his move we have a great stake in the political stability of south korea but this resolution expresses the view that at this point in time in the history of south korea the way to establish political stability is not through a continuation of repression but through the establishment of democracy i am pleased to say that during the course of the last few weeks the administration has spoken in favor of democracy in that country endorsed the concept of dialog and sent a special emissary there to meet with the leaders of the government and also with the leaders of the opposition during that period of time i am also pleased to say that the administration has enjoyed the strong support of the congress i think that we are witnessing in korea today a classic example of how our country is always most effective abroad when we are unified at home in the last 24 hours the chairman of the ruling democratic justice party mr roh tae woo in an historic announcement called for direct presidential elections and the release of political prisoners as a way of bringing about a dialog with the opposition and a new national consensus in his country i want to point out to the members that the resolution before the house today has a section which welcomes the proposals by chairman roh and expresses the hope that they will in fact serve as a basis and as a vehicle for establishing a genuine national consensus in south korea which can lay the groundwork for an enduring political stability in that country and for continued economic growth and prosperity let me also say that thanks in particular to the efforts of our very good friend the gentleman from new york this resolution includes strong language pointing to the absence of and an abuse of human rights in north korea and also urges the government of north korea to take steps to defuse tensions on the korean peninsula so i would say in conclusion that this resolution which was adopted by the foreign affairs committee by a vote of 26 to nothing and which is now before the house gives us an opportunity to send a message and a signal first to the government of south korea and second to the people of south korea that the united statesthe administration and the congress conservatives and liberals republicans and democratsis united in the view that what that country needs is the establishment of genuine democracy we are on the verge of an historic transition in south korea from dictatorship to democracy it is due in my judgment first and foremost to the courage of the korean people who have taken seriously the most fundamental values upon which our country was founded over two centuries ago it is also a tribute to the courageous leadership of opposition leaders like kim daejung and kim young sam who for over a decade have held aloof the torch of liberty it is a tribute to government leaders like roh tae woo who have the statesmanship and vision to recognize that with the future of their nation hanging in the balance the best way to save it is to move toward democracy and it is due finally to the fact that here in the united states on this critical and potentially controversial issue we are once again united let this be a precedent and an example that we can extend to other areas of the world where we can join hands in speaking up for our fundamental interests abroad based on a recognition that the best way to protect our strategic interests is to promote our political values"], [0.48575103282928467, 0.5142489671707153, 1, "i yield myself 10 minutes the national park service was established by the congress in 1916 to protect the great national treasures that give substance to our natural and cultural heritage over the years the congress has authorized 341 units of the national park system each park nationally significant and all established in perpetuity perpetuity means that the park service should manage the park units to protect and preserve the resources so that succeeding generations will have the opportunity to know first hand our natural and cultural heritage the congress has repeatedly reaffirmed that the protection of units of the national park system should be given the highest priority and has stated section 1 1970 administrative act that these lands shall be managed to prevent derogation of the values for which they were created management of natural and cultural resources in the park system in perpetuity required the development of a highly professional organization that was trained to protect the natural and cultural resources on the basis of reaching objectives in scores or even hundreds of years the national park service is the result of that requirement and carried out the mandate in a highly professional manner during its first 40 to 50 years however as land and resource scarcity has increased so have the pressures of special interest segments of society to take actions detrimental to the basic legislative directives to protect the national park system such actions have polarized opposite reactions from citizen groups and the general public who see park resources being seriously degraded the result of these conflicts has been a rapidly escalating process whereby professional resource managers decisionmaking has been supplanted by political decsionmaking such political interference tends to make decisions based on the shortterm need to react to pressure from favored groups or individuals and is rarely looked at in terms of longterm park protection objectives such declsionmaking is rarely one reflecting any national policy or goal but involves the minutiae of day to day operations even under the best of circumstances with enough money enough staff sufficient legal authority and professional management free of overt daily political interference it would be difficult to fully carry out the mandate of congress to protect the park system overuse at yosemite water developments and pollution destroying the bird life in the everglades oil and gas drilling at the boundary of glacier a shopping mall at manassas subdivisions at antietam and dozens of other problems beset the park management we need to set the kinds of policy that will help these people do their job and not allow archaic organizational ideas detract from the best solutions let me emphasize national what we are talking about here are our national treasures areas we and past congresses have said are worthy of nation al protection not as an adjunct to increase the value of houses and businesses built next to them not as a convenient way to hold minerals timber forage or oil and gas until someone wants to use them not as a federal land reserve to be sold to the highest bidder for homes or tourist development and not for multiple use of the resources in the parks we the congress established this national park system to protect and preserve those resources in perpetuity not until it was convenient for economic or ideological reasons to find ways to use or destroy those resources the first director of the national park service stephen mather recognized in 1916 that no university programs existed to train the kind of professional he needed in fact the principles of ecology scientific land and resource management were only vaguely known and expounded in the broadest concepts by a few writers such as john muir stephen mather started the process to develop professional park managers and succeeded the leadership of the national park service from mather on was provided by dedicated park professionals until the 1960s when a director was appointed from the staff of the committee to reele t the president the previous direct of the park service had been fired because he tried to protect a park unit from exploitation by a presidential contributor in a later administration the heritage conservation and recreation service was established in part to weaken the role of the park service in the most recent administration political appointees were substituted for professionals at various levels and at different times including the deputy director of the national park service the assistant secretarys office changed performance ratings of professional employees for political reasons the secretary publicly attacked park personnel at grand canyon and threatened formal personnel action all of which was quietly dropped after the inspector general found no improprieties national park service personnel appearing before house committees present testimony written by lowlevel political appointees in the assistant secretarys office that rarely reflects the professional views of the park service secretary hodel designated the whlitaker chambers pumpkin patch as a national historic landmark reversing the decision of the historic advisory council and the national park service the director of the national park service was excluded from high level meetings by the assistant secretary that dealt with coal leasing contiguous with national parks which is part of a deliberate pattern of excluding park service views on issues of interest within the department of the interior the director of the park service has consistently been ordered to give political testimony opposing bills before congress on such issues as aircraft overflight natchez historic site and expansion of the john muir national historic site in spite of the directors public statement of support for such legislation the director of the park service should be free to advocate for park service issues and to give professional judgment to the congress on february 8 1988 epa published a draft rule in the federal register proposing to establish a new psdprevention of significant deteriorationincrement for nitrogen oxide and asked for public and agency comments deputy under secretary of the interior becky norton dunlop sent official comments to epa for the department without any national park service input the national park service with nearly 25 air quality experts on its staff is the only agency in the department which has lands classified as class i for psd afiitr national park service protest they were allowed to negotiate a set of comments through the department but the national park service official comments were watered down considerably eliminating the national park service recommendations of a shortterm increment of less than 1 year because nitrogen oxide effects such as visibility impairment ozone formation and acid deposition occur during a period of time much shorter than i year and eliminating the national park service recommendation that the baseline date for establishing the major source increment consumption be set in 1980 rather than 1988 the effect is that protection would be considerably less this is particularly a problem at locations such as prudhoe bay whose emissions currently exceed even class ii standards in order words the secretary of the interior would not allow the director to be an advocate to protect the parks the assistant secretarys office forced the resignation of one regional director and forced the demotion of another for political reasons most recently secretary hodel has required an inspector general investigation into the role of the director and one other employee of the park service because they were meeting with a group to encourage local efforts to provide park and recreation opportunities through privately sponsored outdoor week even though such actions by the park service are clearly authorized by public law 8829 secretary hodel threatened director mott with possible criminal charges and advised him and his employees to retain in attorney the employee fearing for his job and his freedom has already spent large amounts for an attorney but has yet to be advised of any charges this is simply the latest example of political harassment of professional employees there have been a significant number of unsuccessful attempts other than those ive listed to alter congressional directives to protect the units of the park system to privatize park units to eliminate professional leadership and replace it with political appointees and to eliminate or diminish funding for the national park system many of those attempts failed but unfortunately many succeeded to the detriment of our national parks in fact too many of these attempts have succeedcd and it is now clear that political expediene will continue to undermine professional management of the national park system unless we take some action to reassert a reasonable balance between longterm protection of the national and cultural resources of the park system and responsiveness to the policy directives expected from any given administration i believe that h r 3964 does that the bill does not direct any radical changes it simply and substantially readjusts the relationship of the park service and the secretary of the interior the administrations domestic policy functions and budget control are left with the secretary but daytoday policy and operations control are shifted to the director of the park service much has been made of a letter from the justice department alleging that h r 3964 is unconstitutional the arguments by justice are the same arguments they used in attempting to strike down the independent counsel law the supreme court overwhelmingly rejected their arguments on that issue and i believe have completely discredited the argument over this bill however in an attempt to clarify the allegation by justice i wish to point out the issues in support of a variety of actions since 1981 designed to ensure ultimate presidential control of decisionmaking in all executive branch agencies the reagan administration has consistently challenged the power of the congress on a variety of issues claiming constitutional authority for the president to absolutely control the actions of all executive branch employees and to require them to be responsible only to the president or his appointees and not to act in accordance with the laws passed by the congress unless so ordered the congressional research service crsj has reported on this issue before and issued a report dated october 18 1987 which states in the summary this report analyzes and assesses the legal and historical underpinnings of the theory and concludes that congresss authority to enact legislation directing and controlling administrative decisionmaking has a substantial constitutional basis and that presidential claims of power in this are unjustified assertion by the justice department regarding the unconstitionality of h r 3964 is based on these old wornout and discredited ideas that the president can pick and choose which laws passed by congress he likes or does not like and then order every employee of the federal government to disobey whichever law he does not like i think the issue is a clear one of the executive attempting to reduce the constitutional authority of the legislative branch and leave us not a nation of laws but a nation of presidential whim however to further clarify the issue i asked crs american law division for an opinion on this specific justice department letter let me quote a few of the legal opinions discrediting the justice view provided to me by crs 1 congress can assign a head of department any executive power not textually reserved to the president in article ii 2 the take care clause used in the justice letter as the basis of their position has not been read by the courts to vest absolute power in the president over heads of departments and other subordinate officials 3 in the words of the supreme court where a valid duty is imposed upon an executive official by the congress the duty and responsibility grow out of and are subject to the control of the law and not the direction of the president 4 relevant judicial precedent and the history of federal administrative practice appear to accord congress virtually plenary power over the creation of the structure of the administrative bureaucracy and the power and tenure of the offices and officers who are to carry out the legislative will 5 limiting presidential removal is in the courts words an appropriate incident of congresss power to subject nonpolitical officers to the control of the law and not to the direction of the president 6 statutory requirements that executive branch officials report directly to the congress trace their roots to the very first congress the legislation establishing the treasury department required the secretary to report to congress 7 in the case of h r 3964 the chief executive maintains his ability to communicate with the director with respect to budget matters and proposed legislation and to influence his ultimate views moreover the presidents recommendatory duty under article ii is not circumscribed in any way by such a provision 8 the director of the national park service would clearly appear to be such a nonpolitical officer and h r 3964 makes the intent to insulate that office from presidential control abundantly evident threats of a veto aside there is clearly no constitutional basis to support the justice letter in fact this consistent effort to subordinate the role of congress to legislate direction to the executive is simply an attempt to override the powers of the congress and i for one intend to do everything i can to see that this illadvised transgression does not succeed on another subject some have argued that independence for the director to direct the park service and the review board established by this legislation is not consistent with sound management well let me make it clear that it is the intent of this legislation that the director be made responsible for managing the national park service i do not intend that some faceless political hack in the white house or omb or some unknown assistant to the deputy assistant secretary who is accountable to no one and cannot be held responsible for his decisions should continue to direct the national park service as is now the case i also have concerns with the idea of a totally independent agency and feel that organizational checks are needed to keep such agencies in balance this bill includes three such checks the presidential appointment and senate confirmation of the director retention of the cabinet policy and budget authority by the secretary and finally the establishment of a watchdog review board this threemember review board would be appointed by the president for fixed terms from the ranks of natural or cultural resource professionals to maintain oversight of the park service public concerns with their actions and to advise the president and congress as to their view and recommendations peer review groups such as this have long been the backbone of professional and scientific organizations oversight of actions by their members it has been used by doctors lawyers and universities among others it is also paralleled by the business management teams that are now common in industry i believe its about time we tried this approach in government and i believe it is essential to the proper management and protection of our national park system ive also heard objections because the review board and staff would cost more money in fact cbo estimates it would cost about 1 5 million per year what cbo and the critics did not say was that because of the shift in responsibilities from the secretarys office to the review board and the director a number of highly paid political appointees who now direct the park service will not have jobs no one knovs for sure how many such positions would be cut by the next administrationsince this legislation can not affect the current administrationbut i can easily assume there will be a reduction cf six to eight people as a result of these tradeoffs any additional costs for a more efficient and effective organization will be minimal i believe this legislation is a logical and necessary reaction on the part of the congress to respond to changing circumstances that are adversely affecting the national treasures that we have placed in the care of the national park service the problems are evident the alternative solutions may be debatable but the need for action by the congress is without question and i believe that h r 3964 is the best solution that we can achieve i urge all of my colleagues to support h r 3964 i reserve the balance of my time"],

provision for the critical foreign languages program in the secretarys discretionary fund of the department of education while the second would establish presidential awards of excellence in the teaching of foreign languages i am very pleased to be joined by representative sawyer in introducing the first amendment and equally pleased to have your support and that of the ranking minority member for both measures the critical foreign languages program of the secretarys discretionary fund is a small but important component of the federal governments involvement in foreign language education at the elementary and secondary levels for the past 3 years this program has been allocated 2 million each year mostly for grants to fund a total of 70 foreign language programs at the elementary and secondary levels the types of programs funded are those that are superior in and of themselves or are good models mostly in the areas of teacher training and curriculum development for critical foreign languages this category officially includes a total of over 100 languages though there is a narrower category of the 11 most critical and a large portion of the programs are actually in just 3 languages chinese japanese and arabic there is a concentration on these three because among those languages critical to our national security and economic prosperity there is a special need for programs in these three most of the programs to date have been cooperative ventures between local schools and institutions of higher education in addition some money has gone directly to state education associations to aid in the development of statewide plans for foreign language curriculums the critical languages program has become one of the most effective among those funded by the secretarys discretionary fund and as i mentioned one of the best foreign language programs at the federal level nonetheless it was deleted from the school improvement act by the committee largely as i understand because the discretionary fund is mostly intended to fund math and science programs and because an option to spend money on foreign language programs would still be retained however historically nearly all the money in the discretionary fund not specifically earmarked for foreign languages has been used to meet pressing math and science needs while i applaud the increased attention to foreign languages recently demonstrated by congress in h r 3 the critical foreign languages program of the secretarys discretionary fund is much more valuable than its small funding level of approximately 2 million would suggest it is the only part of title iii specifically earmarked for foreign languages and departmental staff have ensured that these funds are used for innovative and solid programs eliminating critical foreign languages from the discretionary fund would mean that little or no title ii money would go toward foreign languages and a small but important portion of the federal governments foreign language program would be lost my amendment would add foreign languages to math and science as an eligible area for funding under section 2130 national programs of title iicritical skills improvement of the school improvement act it would in addition set aside 25 percent of the funds in national programs specifically for the improvement and expansion of instruction in critical foreign languages this amendment restores the status quo for this program before the drafting of h r 5 and would not increase the cost of h r 5 because funds would be taken out of those authorized for the entire program this amendment would guarantee the continuation of a small but important program focusing on languages essential to our security and economic wellbeing and therefore constitute a contribution to our country far in excess of the resources devoted to it my second measure would establish a system of presidential awards for teaching excellence in foreign languages in order to focus national attention on the critical need for foreign language teachers few people would i believe deny that such a pressing need exists in a recent survey by the national association of state supervisors of foreign language teachers 57 percent of the states responding reported a current shortage and almost 65 percent expect to experience such a shortage in the near future while considerable attention has been devoted to decreasing the shortage of teachers in other areas notably math and science important to our security and economic prosperity relatively little effort has been made to remediate a comparably great shortage of foreign language teachers my amendment which would add a new section 2135 to title iicritical skills improvement would take a small but significant step toward correcting this major deficiency in oureducational system a total of 104 awards would be made by the president to elementary and secondary teachers who have demonstrated outstanding teaching qualifications in the field of foreign languages at least one elementary and one secondary school teacher from each state as well as the district of columbia and puerto rico would be selected thereby ensuring attention across the nation to foreign language teachers the cost of this program would be 1 million for fiscal year 1988 with the necessary sums being allocated in subsequent years while this amendment would not actually create a new federal foreign language program these presidential awards would significantly add to the prestige of good foreign language teachers and thereby motivate a greater number of more highly qualified persons to become and remain foreign language teachers this would have significant value beyond the relatively small cost of the program as it is now difficult for many school districts across the country to attract and retain highly qualified foreign language instructors in general as i noted foreign language instruction has been neglected in favor of other critical skills given that the ease of learning a second language is inversely proportional to age it is discouraging to find that only 1 percent of students in our elementary schools receive any kind of foreign language training moreover a 198283 survey showed that only 21 3 percent of all high school students were enrolled in foreign language courses 88 percent of which were in spanish and french these distressing facts attest to the need to devote much more and higher quality attention to foreign languages especially at the elementary and secondary levels this measure would dramatically increase the prestige of teaching foreign languages and therefore help improve instruction in and attention to foreign languages in the crucial years to come global interdependency is a fact of life and america can no longer exist in this world wearing linguistic blinders the investment in our future national security and prosperity represented by these two measures is very minimal yet the stakes are high we must act now to put our foreign language and international education system back on track and these amendments represent small but significant steps in this direction i therefore urge the support of my colleagues for both measures"], [0.48607003688812256, 0.5139299631118774, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me this past saturday

beach blankets or their towels we were there for quite a different purpose we were there literally to catch the drift and bag it we were doing in delaware what people are doing on the coast and the beaches of the carolinas florida texas new jersey and maine and the beaches of the west coast as well there were few surprises in what we found as we collected the refuse of our own beaches for the most part though we came up with the kind of things one would expect to find as we go up and down the beaches of our state we found an assortment of bottles and cans we found pieces of styrofoam cups and plenty of cigarette butts mostly however we found plastics and other floatables we found plastic eating utensils we found plastic bags we found plastic containers we found plastic sixpack yokes we found plastic everything or so it seemed now i realize that some of the items we found on our beaches just like the items other americans will find on their beaches when they do their cleanups this year were left there by people who came to enjoy our beaches this summer the people who did bring their suntan lotion and their towels and their blankets but i know that a great deal of what we found last saturday and a great deal of what others will find on their beaches this fall are items that were simply tossed overboard from ships in the atlantic ocean or the pacific ocean or the gulf of mexico twenty years ago i was a navy midshipman i spent several of my summers aboard naval vessels in the atlantic and the pacific oceans i remember clearly how we used to take our trash each day to the fantail of our ship and simply toss it overboard at the time i liked to think that that trash would simply sink to the bottom and never be a problem to anyone or to anyone concerned with our environment perhaps most of it did sink and perhaps most of it never did show its face again and never posed a problem to any of us today much of the refuse that is dumped by naval vessels and much of the refuse that is dumped by merchant ships and much of the refuse that is dumped by fli hing vessels is plastic it floats and we are going to see it again we saw it again last satuday and we will see it again next saturday and in the saturdays ahead as our volunteers found out last saturday much of this stuff floats it does not degrade it is with us for a long long time the time has come though to put a stop to this particular form of pollution to our oceans and our beaches if we can do that we will take a big step forward today the legislation before us today is not a panacea it is not going to end the need for beach cleanups in my state or in your state either but i think the adoption of this bill will eventually reduce the number of deaths to sea turtles off our shores sea turtles which have swallowed or ingested plastic bags when they thought they were eating a jellyfish the adoption of this legislation will stop the strangulation of birds on my beaches and on your beaches birds that have been strangulated by plastic sixpack yokes from soft drink cans or other cans this legislation will mean that our nations troubled coastal waters and our troubled beaches will begin to regain a bit of their luster and a bit of their beauty which unfortunately has been lost in recent years i want to commend the chairman of this subcommittee the gentleman from massachusetts i commend the gentleman from new jersey and all members on both sides of the aisle on the committee on merchant marine and fisheries we work very well together i think we are taking a good step forward in

to share with you and my colleagues some thoughts on the continuing unwillingness of the turkish government to recognize the tragedy of the armenian genocide of 1915 it is true as the turkish government insists that the atrocities suffered by the armenians were prepetrated by the ottoman turkish empire and not by the current turkish republic still deeply feel that the continuity of culture population and geography create a moral imperative for the current turkish government to address itself accurately and honestly to the armenian genocide after all the federal republic of germany is surely an altogether different government from the regime of hitlers third reich yet the west german government has assumed vast moral responsibility for recording the history of the holocaust and making reparation payments to its survivors the united states can and should maintain friendly and constructive relations with both armenians and turks however such relations must be rooted in our commitment to historical truths and to the universal principles of human rights surely the truth about the armenian martyrs should not be denied or forgotten i am both very well aware of and very proud of the fact that i represent a large and politically vibrant armenian community i share with armenians around the world an intense interest in middle eastern affairs i am especially concerned with the role the united states plays in that region as you all know there is a great deal of tension between the united states and turkey this tension derives from two sources though i want to mention both of them i am going to confine the rest of my remarks to the second problem first turkey used american military equipment in the invasion of cyprus that equipment was given to turkey with the explicit understanding that it would be used only for defensive purposess it was given to turkey so that turkey could play its proper role as a member of the nato alliance i and many other members of congress have been unwilling to support turkish arms requests in view of the outrageous misuse to which american arms were put during the war on cyprus i will continue to view such requests with a high degree of suspicion the second strain between the united states and turkey comesfrom turkeys past and present human rights record naturally today i have uppermost in mind the monstrous treatment of armenians in this century i do however want to note that other minorities including greeks jews and christians have suffered at the hands of the turkish muslim majority true the turks of today did not commit the genocide of 65 years ago that wiped out half of the worlds armenian population however the turks of today and their government have shown no remorse no sense of decency or compassion they have not paid a cent in reparations to the survivors of the holocaust nor have they permitted armenians to return to historic areas of settlement in eastern turkey i believe the dead thevictims of the armenian holocaust are being denied their human rights we do not usually think of dead people as having human rights yet i believe they do the most elementary human rights of the armenian martyrs were irretrivably taken from them at the time they were murdered they were denied the right to a decent burial they were denied the right to a final resting place to which their kin could come to pay respects like the victims of the nazi genocide against the jews the martyrs disappeared into unmarked mass graves there is one right of the dead which the martyrs have been denied but which can still be restored that is the right to have the world hear and learn the truth about the circumstances of their death i cannot find language strong enough to express my outrage at the fact that the turkish government the turkish educational and cultural establishments turkish historians and journalists almost without exception have lied about the mass murders of one and half million armenians in 1915 the turkish myth like the agitprop of george orwells 1984 simply ignores all the facts of the period the turks have calmly insisted that of course armenians died during the difficult years of world war i so did many other people there were shortages of food and deaths due to starvation health care services were disrupted throughout the country resulting in deaths which might have been prevented but this is not murder this is merely the unfortunate correlates of war and poverty this lie must be exposed in and out of turkey writers artists filmmakers and educators both from within and outside the armenian community must invent vehicles for delivering the truth about the armenian genocide right here in los angeles there are still large numbers of survivors with clear and vivid memories of the death marches of 1915 i know when the older armenians saw how the khmer rouge drove the population out of phnon penh and to their deaths from starvation dehydration disease and machine gun bullets they could not help remembering their own experiences at the hands of the turks i must inject here a note of caution naturally not every turk was a murderer nor does every turk harbor hatred today against greeks and armenians yet we cannot let our tolerance cloud our vision of the role of the turkish government in the events we are discussing certainly if the people and government of west germany could be brought to acknowledgeto some degreetheir role in the crimes of the nazis no less should be expected of the people and government of turkey those of us who know the history of the armenian genocide must not underestimate the ignorance of others the vast majority of americans do not know about this genocide even those who do know about it are generally unaware of the scope and even more unaware of its world historical significance the armenian historian marjorie hagopian relates a little known anecdote in the life of adolph hitler at one of the fuhrers earliest meetings about the jewish problem hitler outlined his plans for the total exterminationof the entire jewish populations of germany and germanoccupied countries one of the men at the meeting asked with astonishment how such a plan could be carried out would not world opinion prevent us from doing such a thing hitler laughed world opinion a joke who ever cared about the armenians each genocide provides a foundation for subsequent horrors each historical misrepresentation of efforts to exterminate a particular ethnic group increases the likelihood that such efforts will be undertaken again in another time and place the united states has leverage in dealing with turkey on human rights questions the turkish republic is heavily dependent on us economically diplomatically and militarily it cannot afford to ignore serioug concerns of the american government i want to conclude by expressing my total disagreement with those in the state department and the white house who feel the events of the past 2 years have made the united states far more dependent on turkey than turkey is on us they reason that the united states desperately needs an alliance with turkey because we have lost our listening posts and other surveillance capabilities we enjoyed before the iranian revolution they reason that the outright conquest of afghanistan by the soviet union has further weakened the united states in that critical region along the soviet border their conclusion is that the united states must humbly and gratefully accept turkish military cooperation and must at the same time refrain from troubling the turkish authorities with idealistic talk of human rights i reason the opposite i reason that turkey has been weakened by the fall of afghanisan it seems obvious to me that turkey is in more need of american defense assistance than ever now that she has an iranian neighbor that is literally without a government certainly it is not in turkeys interest for iran to be under the rule of chaos fanaticism and xenophobia we have both a moral and a political obligation to press to the outermost limits our influence in turkey american indifference to human rights in any country with whom we are closely allied deprives us of any claim to leadership of the free world as your representative in congress i will continue to fight for a strong human rights program i will continue to work for vigorous american efforts on behalf of armenians seeking just redress from turkey finally i will do all in my power to see that the history of the armenian holocaust is told widely truthfully and in full"], [0.4872981905937195, 0.5127018094062805, 1, "it is in sadness that i come before my colleagues of the house tonight to announce the tragic and untimely death of a good friend of mine and important political leader in my congressional district vincent mauro of new haven 45 years old married with two young children was taken from us today following a tragic automobile accident we are all so saddened by this tragic accident and first and foremost our thoughts and our prayers go out to his wife gigi and to their two children in this moment of great sadness and tragedy for them vinnie was a wonderful man and a good friend and he had recently turned down an opportunity to become the state democratic chairman in connecticut because he wanted to be sure to have enough time to devote to his young children who were growing up and who needed his fatherly attention and guidance that makes this occurrence ever so much more ironic and causes us to reflect about the needs that his wife and children will now have we all expect and hope to gather around them and give them the support that they need to get through this most difficult period this certainly is a terrible tragedy for me and for others who worked closely with vinnie mauro in the political arena working together to see to it that the people we served got the kind of representation and government service to whichare are certainly entitled just a month ago vinnie mauro was honored by the new haven chapter of the sons of italy who gave him an award for community service and made reference to all the things he had done to make the city of new haven and surrounding communities a better place for people to live at that gathering vinnies family and friends of many years came together and told him about their pride in the work that he had done it is an occurrence that i am sure we will all look back on with fond memories because we saw vinnie there in the prime of his life with all his friends and supporters around him having an opportunity to tell him the words that many of us will now speak in his memory about how proud we were to be associated with him and with his work he was a great political leader he helped make the democratic party in new haven one of the strongest in the state of connecticut he was able to carry that town for statewide candidates and presidential candidates in good years and bad and he did it because of his unique personal qualities qualities that i think we hope to find in many people involved in political life but are so often disappointed about let me tell you about two facets of vinnies approach to politics first of all vinnie mauro had an extraordinary commitment to openness in the political process he believed the process works best when all have an opportunity to have their say and to participate he was always supporter of registration drives to see to it that all would be registered in no way wanting to keep any group or any group of individuals from participating in the process he saw in registration drives the opportunity to bring people in give them a stake in the result and give them an opportunity to make a difference under his leadership many many new voters were registered in new haven especially many members of the black and hispanic communities who historically had not been registered in such large numbers as we would have liked vinnie mauro was always there encouraging their registration and participation in the political process i remember his openness to newcomers to the political process when i first ran for congress having never run for office before i sought his advice and support he did not turn me away and say get some more experience you really dont belong here you dont have the experience he said the opposite he said go out there and demonstrate what you have to offer get support show people what you can do and if you can show that kind of support i can be there to help you and he was there playing a significant role in all three of my elections to the congress it was that kind of open spirit and desire to get people to participate that was particularly unique and important second he was a man of great integrity someone on whom you could depend when youask vinnie mauro a question you got a straight answer that kind of integrity is essential to the political process we have lost a very good man a man who understood that good government and good politics go together he will be missed very much most of all by his family but also by all of us who worked with him once again our

for arranging for this special order and beyond that for the leadership that the gentleman has provided on this and so many other issues of great concern to our entire nation i want to join in welcoming our fellow citizens from across the country who will be gathering in washington this weekend in a great outpouring a great demonstration of that which the constitution grants all americans the right to peacefully assemble for their rights and to demonstrate their grievances this is the second great march against the discrimination to which people are subjected in this great country because of their affectional or sexual orientation or preferences the one in 1979 was an impressive gathering the one this year promises to be an even greater gathering i think that we meet this time at this gathering under much graver circumstances with the advent of the aids epidemic we now have peoples lives and wellbeing and their very capacity to enjoy their jobs or their homes being discriminated against because of the ignorance of a lot of people who instead of determining that the occasion of illness ought to bring out the best in us use the occasion to do the worse to their fellow citizens in awful need so it seems to me that at the very least what we are underscoring by this great demonstration is a call to responsibility a call to compassion a call to the federal government to provide the kind of leadership which will allow us to meet the challenge aids as quickly and as urgently and as effectively as we possibly can the numbers of people who have already been diagnosed with aids itself is awesome some 42 000 people twentyfour thousand of those people have already died but those numbers become tiny by comparison to what is being projected in the immediate future by 1991 the national academy of sciences and the public health service itself tell us that there will be something like 270 000 cases diagnosed and as many as 170 000 people will have died in 1991 alone there will be probably somewhere around 75 000 new cases diagnosed people who will not have had aids before will be diagnosed that year as having it probably half of those people it is now projected already have the virus within them but the other half will be contracting the virus in the years between now and 1991 the great tragedy is that if there were a sufficient effort at informing people as to the steps that they could take to give themselves the best chance to prevent them from contracting the virus or from spreading or transmitting the virus half of those people could be prevented from getting the disease and it is i think a great national scandal that because of the infighting to use the kindest word that is going on within the administration on the part of those who believe that you can send a preachment or a moral message alone and solve the problem has prevented the professionals in the public health service from doing that which they know and have said has to be done which is to provide as much clear and explicit information as possible to try to prevent scientifically the spread of the disease so although the congress in a great demonstration of responsibility and lack of partisanship has repeatedly voted far more money than the administration has wanted not only for education but for research we find that the money that it has appropriated simply has not been spent because the moralists have taken the field under the leadership of secretary bennett and have really refused to allow the money to be spent the way that it ought to be hopefully the outpouring of hundreds of thousands of people this weekend will again heighten public concern to the extent that it will be able to have some significant impact on this administration then of course we have the basic fundamental thrust toward extending basic constitutional protections to all of our citizens the gentleman from massachusetts from the outset indicated the march we have had through our history in extending the rights which were guaranteed but not really implemented to our citizens as he pointed out on matters of race and religion and sex and national origin we have made steady progress over the years discrimination still exists but it does not have the weight or the support of the law and where in fact it is found to exist there is quick action to penalize those who participate in it the one remaining major area of discrimination is regarding discrimination based on affectional or sexual orientation it is conservatively estimated that there are somewhere between 20 or 25 million of our fellow citizens who fall within the category of discrimination and yet they have no real protection at this point in regard to housing in regard to employment in regard to place of public accommodation or public facilities because the statutes do not include protection for them the legislation which i have had the privilege of being the prime sponsor of since 1979 and which this year has some 70 cosponsors and every congress we have increased the number of sponsors for that legislation seeks to amend the existing civil rights laws which already bar discrimination based on the grounds that i have set forth before simply by adding the words aff ectional or sexual orientation as being grounds on which discrimination will be not permitted and will be outlawed i think that it is high time that that kind of legislation was on the books states and cities and localities across the country are taking their own lead in enacting legislation or in some instances having executive orders issued to provide the kind of protection that this legislation would enact in my own city of new york we started the effort in 1971 and took some 15 years until we finally got legislation enacted prior to that time the mayor of the city of new york had issued an executive order which provided the protection and because of the very introduction of the legislation and the discussions and debate surrounding it i think that the educational process itself helped to reduce the impacts of discrimination i think that even without the benefit of legislation there is undoubtedly less discrimination today than there was 15 years ago but legislation itself provides a great moral drive and thrust and so we hope that the demonstration the march that we will be participating in and that hundreds of thousands of americans will be participating in again will provide the additional impetus so that we can have early enactment of legislation which will implement the provisions of basic civil rights and civil liberties to all of our citizens regardless of their sexual orientation again i commend my colleague and thank him for arranging for this special

to say to him in particular how much i appreciate personally the fine cooperation that he has given the minority in terms of our input throughout the committee process as i mentioned there is very little i can add to the explanation that mr studds just gave the bill prohibits the disposal of plastics from vessels anywhere in the ocean which is so important to our marine mammal and fish environment and to the sea shores as well it prohibits the disposal of dunnage or packing material from ships and also has strict regulations on how solid waste may be disposed of at sea there are two provisions that i thought were very interesting and important to the coastal areas those were mr lowrys proposal and mr hughes proposal to conduct various studies of landbased sources of plastics as well as an educational program which is intended to enlighten all of us on the seriousness of this program but i might say that in light of the national coastal day which was observed just two days ago i know that along with many of my colleagues around the country there were various types of programs that were intended to make note of national coastal days and in keeping our oceans clean having taken part in one of those myself i think i am one along with other members of the house and other members of the public at large who recognize the seriousness of the situation which has evolved relative to a clean ocean or perhaps better put at least in some parts of the country a notsoclean ocean at least at certain times this bill is a very important part only a part of a national strategy which i see emerging just last week we passed a law to reauthorize and expand the sea grant college program a program that is so important in helping us to understand the marine environment and how to deal with it just last week we passed the national ocean policies commission act to establish a new body with a specific charge to set a national agenda for the correct use and wise use of our oceans

what we have done this year in amending the ocean dumping act and the two bills that i just mentioned and todays vote are all very important we have to continue to develop a national policy that has to do with what is so important to our marine environment i know that my good friend from new jersey mr howmw has been very active both here and at home in promoting the cause as espoused in this bill and i commend him for his efforts i hope today will see a unanimous vote on this bill because it sends a message it sends a message to all of those who perhaps do not understand the importance of marine environment or perhaps to those who choose to ignore the importance of a clean marine environment so i ask all of the members on this side of the aisle in fact both sides of the aisle to give this bill their unanimous support i am happy to support the action we are taking here today with h r 940 this bill as it was unanimously approved by the merchant marine and fisheries committee is very similar to the administrations proposed legislation for the implementation of annex v which was recently introduced as h r 3261 this legislation addresses an issue that is critical not only to the united states but one that affects practically every nation on this globe it certainly impacts every one of our coastal states directly as well as our fisheries and even our national economy when enoimous sums are devoted to cleaning up our beaches this does not even include theloss both aesthetically and commercially of wildlife caused by ingestion of or entrapment in plastic debris specifically this legislation will also extend inland the reach of the act to the internal waters of the united states this means the great lakes and all of our other navigable waters will also be protected under the coverage of annex v from additional plastic pollution this should signal to the rest of the world our commitment to the prevention of further pollution of this precious and limited resource of particular importance to me is the inclusion of a requirement to strengthen the epa and noaa study provisions including investigating the effects of medical wastes found washing up on our shores also a public education program on the effects of plastic pollution is required i want to thank mr lowry and mr hughes for joining me in an effort to include these items in the committee reported bill as my colleagues know we in new jersey have experienced tremendous amounts of trash washed up on the beaches this bill will attack this problem head on in addition this bill carries a committee amendment reauthorizing the national sea grant college program for 3 years the sea grant program is a unique partnership between government business and 300 universities which has developed many marinerelated products benefiting all of the united states the program funds research graduate fellowships and congressional or executive branch internships with the goal of encouraging the wise use of our ocean and coastal resources we must all be conscious of the impact of our actions on the world around us and implementation of annex v to the international convention for the prevention of

know what i get from the america last crowd is basically when i say that we are putting a cuba in central america they poohpooh that they say that that is ridiculous all that these are are just nice kindly people down there who are not interested in communism they are interested in bringing in freedom to the people of nicaragua i think that these people forget history i would like to quote from some remarks that were made by our secretary of state george shultz before the american bar association that i think succinctly outline the threat of having a cuba in nicaragua we forget that cuba is on our shores and we forget what cuba is all about now we also forget about world war ii and early in the second world war german uboats destroyed unitedstates merchant shipping in the caribbean at a faster rate than we could replace it this is quoting secretary shultz but he more aptly outlines the threat that we now have in cuba and i quote one serious blow to this hemispheres security was struck in 1959 when fidel castro established a communist dictatorship in cuba and brought that island into the soviet camp he goes on today the soviet union cuba as an important military base in this hemisphere from cuba the soviet union flies reconnaissance flights up and down the east coast of the united states in cuba the soviet union has a port of call for its submarines from cuba the soviet union monitors united states communications using one of the largest and most effective electronic surveillance sites in the world cuban troops act as soviet surrogates in ethiopia and angola the cuban government smuggles arms and provides aid and training to guerrillas and terrorists throughout the western hemisphere in the event of a conventional war in europe or in the persian gulf cuba would constitute a threat to our ability to aid our allies and defend our strategic interests in those vital regions the secretary also said we risked nuclear confrontation with the soviet union over the removal of their missiles from cuba today we must spend billions of dollars to strengthen our counterintelligence apparatus and our naval and air defenses against soviet use of an island 90 miles off our shore and we learned the value of such an outpost to the soviet union which spends and i think this is important which spends over 4 billion every year to sustain three times what the unitedstates spends for all forms of bilateral assistance in all of latin america"], [0.5141276717185974, 0.5141276717185974, 0, "i would like to thank the gentleman from florida the gentleman from oregon and the gentleman from utah who have provided great leadership on this issue let me just suggest to the american citizens who are thinking about this issue what needs to be changed one of the startling facts with the change in the supreme soviet is that the reelection rate now to the house of representatives is significantly higher than the reelection rate to the supreme soviet the reality is this body ies become very staid we need a change in the length of terms for a variety of reasons but they relate to the harms that this body has fallen into first we have gone on with a reelection rate because of congressional perks and because of the powers of the office that in effect deny a free choice to the american people with regard to policy we simply have incumbents too well entrenched second we have developed a staffing level for congress that absolutely defies the imagination the committee that i served on and i know the g ntleman from utah still serves on am that is interior and his predecessor s rved on interior as well and was the chairman of that committee and when wayne aspinall first went on interior they had four fulltime staffers his comment waynes comment to me was that four were too many that they really just needed two since then the workload of interior has dropped in half less than in half in any way that one would want to measure it and the staffing has grown to 78 we have so many staffers on interior now that they cannot all get into the room at one time with doing less work half the work that four fulltime staffers did we have a staff that is 10 times as big for congress as any deliberative body in the world the simple fact is congress has rigged the game with regard to reelection has wasted resources with regard to staffing and it has developed a rulingclass mentality where some of the folks who serve in this body begin to think of themselves as a permanent ruling class over the american people instead of servants of those people and part of it is a factor of staying here too long not all of it we worry about i think the power of special interests one good thing that limitation on terms can do is provide that fresh flow of new blood and new ideas and new vigor that can come to a body that can strengthen it and give it the independence and i suspect most importantly of all what suffers by the long long service that developed in this body is a feeling that we do not have to live under the laws that we pass and that is evident in almost every aspect of congress this congress has exempted itself from the civil rights act from the environmental protection act from the conflict of interest act almost every major statute that deals with human behavior that we have condemned in society as a whole we allow in this body and the simple fact is we have developed a mentality that is isolated from the people we attempt to serve limitation on terms would help people know that they have to go back and live under the laws they pass and i believe it would make an enormous difference we would have a congress that is more likely to understand the problem they are regulating or the problems they are causing and they are more likely to understand what it is like to pay taxes and i think we would end up with a far more responsive house of representatives just one fact i think that is interest ng prior to 1930 our nation only had 2 years when the gross national product spent by government all levels of government combined exceeded 10 percent we are a private economy since 1930 we have not had a year when it was under 10 percent the 2 years of exception were 1 year in world war i and 1 year in the civil war we are now at a point where almost 40 percent of the gross national product of this country is spent by federal and state and ical levels of government we have taken much of the decisionmaking and the power and the creativity away from the people of this nation who do the work and put it into the hands and decision of those who attempt to rule it through this body and state governments and so on the problem with that is we have lost sight of what motivates america i think the gentlemans

recall that the house considered the fair housing legislation on june 22 and june 23 and finally approved the legislation on june 29 subsequently when the housepassed bill went to the other body a series of negotiations ensued to resolve the remaining differences between the civil rights community and the administration our purpose here today is to consider and hopefully accept the changes to h r 1158 adopted by the senate it should be pointed out that these changes have the support of the unitedstates department of housing and urban development the department of justice as well as key elements in the business community principally the national association of realtors and the national association of home builders the amendments adopted in the other body do no harm to the spirit of the balanced compromise approved by this house just a few weeks ago in fact many of these amendments serve to enhance and reinforce some of the provisions contained in that compromise for example many members of this house were concerned about the potential adverse impact that the coverage of families with children could have on senior citizens retirement communities under the language of one notable senate amendment existing senior citizen communities will have increased flexibility and possibility to qualify for the exemption from the familial status requirements just as important is the senateadded language providing a transition period for the current residents of housing that excludes children they will not be required to leave that housing nor will they be subject to eviction that is existing residents whose presence in a community or apartment complex might otherwise cause the community to fall outside the protections in section 807 b 2 will not be counted in calculating whether the exemption should apply the bottom line is that senior citizens retirement communities across the united states will have a greater chance of qualifying for the housing for older persons exemption furthermore no one will be evicted whether in a senior citizens community or an alladult community because of the enactment of this bill litigation authority was also an issue when we considered h r 1158 on this floor approximately 6 weeks ago the language contained in the bill before the house today fully consolidates in the department of justice the authority to represent the federal government in all of the enforcement actions under the fair housing act however while the litigation will be conducted by lawyers from the department of justice the decision as to whether or not prompt judicial action is necessary to obtain injunctive relief or to seek court enforcement of a finding of discriminatirn will still be lodged with the secretary of housing and urban development so under the latest compromise the secretary will decide whether or not litigation should occur where the secretary authorizes the litigation it is transmitted to the attorney general and lie is required to promptly commence and maintain such action consistent with the terms of the senate amendment the amended version of h r 1158 also contains a technical amendment to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies making it clear that certain interim certifications by hud are included in the bill the language adopted in the other body also makes it clear that this legislation is not requiring the establishment of a federal building code because of the accessibility and adaptability requirement for newly constructed multifamlly dwellings these and the other changes made in h r 1158 are improvements and refinements fully consistent with the spirit of the housepassed compromise bill we are in the final stretch run of a circuitous race that began nearly 10 years ago this bipartisan effortto strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1968 law and expand the coverage of the fair housing protections under title viii of the civil rights acthas tested the stamina of many of us in this house my good friend and distinguished colleague from california civil and constitutional rights subcommittee chairman don edwards in particular is to be commended for his patience determination and effective leadership in this effort we are on the threshold of finally passing a federal fair housing law that is workable and effective thirtysix million disabled persons will receive the protections of this fundamental civil rights statute families with children will no longer be arbitrarily limited in their choice of decent housing the secretary of hud will have new and significant powers to investigate discrimination complaints and to enforce the rights guaranteed under this statute if discrimination is found and proven state and local fair housing agencies will contintic their vital integral role in fair housing enforcement all across the united states the states and localities are given an adequate grace period to bring their statutes and ordinances in line with the new federal law so that they can continue to handle a majority of these fair housing complaints complainants and respondents in fair housing discrimination cases are guaranteed due process rights in administrative proceedings and the fundamental right to a trial by jury in a unitedstates district court in instances where they so elect either the adjudication or the trial that results from the election is intended to be a final decision concerning the claims raised by the aggrieved person or any intervenor the aggrieved person or any intervenor may not relitigate the same claims raised in the complaint or seek additional or alternative relief through a direct action in federal court as was reflected in the colloquy between the gentleman from california and myself during consideration of this legislation in june res judicata applies and the intent is that claims based upon the same set of facts should be consolidated into one case before concluding i want to take this one last opportunity to mention some of the individuals who over the years have made positive and prominent contributions to this effort i have already noted and want to reinforce the tremendous contribution made by the gentleman from california the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner deserves special recognition our thanks go to the secretary of housing and urban development sam pierce for his pivotal role in this entire effort through his 8 years in office as the hud secretary sam pierce has consistently and staunchly advocated fair housing reform now on the threshold of a final success secretary pierce deserves acknowledgment and acclaim for his many contributions in addition i also want to give muchdeserved credit to our former colleague and friend from the other body the distinguished senator from maryland charles mcc mathias for many years mac was the principal sponsor of this legislation in the senate and was always ready and willing to lend his time and his advice to this effort pivotal players over the years have been ralph neas the executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights as well as my good friend althea simmons executive director washington office of the naacp kerry scanlon of the washington lawyers committee for civil rights under law wade henderson of the aclu and penda hair of the naacp legal defense fund also brought their usual fairness and balance to this effort the compromise that brought about prompt approval of this legislation in the house of representatives just a few weeks ago could never have occurred without the assistance of these and other representatives of the civil rights community their willingness to compromise was the key this is also an appropriate time to give recognition to many of the unsung heroes which you may not read about in the newspapers but nevertheless have made major contributions to the development of this legislation and its prospects for success from the staff of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights chief counsel catherine leroy associate counsel stuart ishimaru and minority counsel alan slobodin i also want to express grateful thanks and appreciation to marion morris who served for 4 years as the legislative assistant to senator mathias during that time ms morris made numerous and significant

objections to this suspension today first of all this is in effect the third closed rule that we have had we have only had two other bills this year the cleanwater and highway they were both closed now this is being brought up on suspension and you know it is beginning to look like we are never going to get a chance as members to offer any kind of amendments that may really need to be considered i am also very much concerned about that process that has been used here there have not been hearings there are a lot of questions that need to be answered for instance it really bothers me that this transfer of this 50 million for homeless will be taken out of the fema funds since i am from an area that is prone to have disastersnot necessarily at this time of the year but at other times of the yeari really worry about their ability to respond to a major disaster then i have the question what about the traditional assistance programs for the poor why are they not taking care of these homeless needs housing needs it is not as if we have not had a considerable amount of assistance going into that area fema has received 370 million for its emergency food and shelter program since 1983 millions of other dollars have gone into such programs as usdas emergency feeding program a billion dollars in surplus commodities since 1982 50 million a year for distribution costs and 75 million for emergency feeding centers then you have the hhs program for runaway and homeless youth 23 million general revenue sharing goes to cities and states they could use that money for this purpose blockgrant funds so it is not as if we have been ignoring the problem in this particular area i also wonder since this was just done in the committee on appropriations have we had adequate hearings have we really looked into it who are these people do they really want to be brought in off the streets ther e is also a constitutional question here the courts have ruled that we cannot go out and just take these people and force them into housing how do you address that question but the main concern that i have is that this is another crash program and when you have crash programs like this even though there is a time sensitivity here you tend to make a mess for instance just this past sunday there was a frontpage article in a local newspaper that pointed out that there are at least 12 apartments in washington dc for the homeless that are being paid for to the tune of 3 078 a month3 078 a month for 1 apartment and there are at least 12 of from contractors and hopes to negotiate

study committee the ced and some republican groups and we were again told in absolutely no uncertain terms that the trade deficit is a function of the domestic deficit and that if america if this congress cannot do something to address the domestic deficit that recession will follow as surely as night follows day and day follows night i know we are all deeply concerned we talk about it among ourselves we anguish about it but we do not act one of the things we are good at is blaming we spend a lot of time at blame rhetoric there is not any blame to be laid our deficit has a perfect bipartisan origin there was not one penny of spending that was not approved by the president of the united states a republican the senate of the united states under republican leadership and this house under democrat leadership so to pretend that this is anyones budget other than ours the democrats and republicans of america is to put your head in the sand and prefer rhetoric to the kind of reality therapy that the jobs of the people that we represent depend on and mark my words this is bread and butter for the people of america this is not deficit rhetoric this is life this is jobs this is the economic wellbeing of our nation and of the international community i am a republican who has run for office every time consistently telling my constituents that to reduce the deficit we have to increase taxes and cut spending but i cannot vote for this budget resolution because it does not pair those two tough courses of action responsibly and it will not reduce the deficit let us now look at your original promise democrats the democrats said give us control and the democrats have it in the house and in the other body and the democrats have it in the conference and i would remind the members that it was the house republican budget that came out of the conference last year a budget that was responsible that the democrats voted against that the republicans voted for and it was the conference committee budget so we have done our share this year the democrats have complete control and the democrats said let us make it simple clean let us make it tough we will increase taxes 50 percent cut spending 50 percent here are the taxes more than 19 5 billion out of 36 billion is going to be tax increases that is clean and even some of us will support it but let us look at the spending cut side what happened to spending cuts that were to be balanced with tax increases well 20 percent of the spending cuts are asset sales those are not spending cuts those are new revenues another 8 percent is increased collections through the irs that is not spending cuts that is new revenues and another portion of the spending cuts is the reduction in debt service costs due to saving 36 billion but if you do not save 36 billion you cannot get it in deficit retirement so we do not have that perfect symmetry that you offered the nation in the rhetoric that you have been espousing in the last couple of months we do not have 18 billion in tax increases and 18 billion in spending cuts we have 18 billion in tax increases and we have a lot of new revenues user fees are counted on the spending cut side of the budget asset sales you are putting on the spending cut side of the budget and also increased revenues as a result of increased funding for irs what do you put on the cut side of the budget you cut a mere 7 2 billion including what you cut in defense that is pathetic and where do you cut you do not tell us where you cut you ascribe 3 5 billion of all those cuts to reconciliation and 1 5 billion is to come out of medicaid or medicare but nobody is to feel it the american people are not stupid they know that if you are going to cut 1 5 billion out of medicare they are going to know it so let us get on with a program here let us reject this budget and let us come back in with something that says how you are going to cut that 18 billion to pair with the 18 billion in tax increases and let us protect americas future"]], "top_unsure": [[8.344650268554688e-07, 0.49999916553497314, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me as a member of the military construction appropriations subcommittee i have followed the issue of base closings for about 6 or 8 years intensively and even before then as a member of congress i was very interested in the issue of base closings it may be somewhat encyclopedic i suppose to advise members that in 1969 some military bases were closed in fact i recall when i first arrived as a newly elected member of congress the secretary of defense recommended that a naval training reserve center in my district be closed and after conferring with many of my constituents in helena ar they agreed that it was a waste of money to maintain that facility and we agreed that it should be closed in contrast eaker air force base in blytheville has always been regarded as a vital part of americas defense structure the 97th bombardment wing at eaker air force base won the coveted omaha trophy which is annually awarded to the best unit in the strategic air command this honor again demonstrates the excellence of eaker air force base so it is not without some reasonable response that members of congress approach this issue even though it is a political one and even though it may be extremely volatile in our various districts to address that question when it affects us directly all americans want to elirainate waste and duplication and unnecessary spending and so do we in congress as we approach these issues the gentleman from texas a minute ago mentioned that base closings alone do not solve the problem of expensive military preparedness the balancing of global commitments against the willingness of taxpayers to pay for the national defense is a vital issue after all if we close a base we still have the units involved which are 72 or 75 pecent of the cost and ostensibly they would be transfered to another facility somewhere else and that does not address the question of manpower levels and equipment costs and so on that are involved frankly i do not know why it is necessary to create another commission like several speakers before me i am somewhat ambivalent about a new commission for this purpose and will reserve my judgment on how to vote until i see what the full content of the bill is after the debate when congress or the adminis ration has an issue that it cannot resolve it seems that we resolve it by establishing a commission i do not think the secretary of defense really needs a commission and the only thing i can say as a member of congress who wants to fulfill my responsibility on these issues of national defense is that i am somewhat reassured that the process of allowing congress to approve or disapprove recommendations that may be made by the proposed commission still remains intact i appreciate the work that has been done by the numerous members

president i have reviewed the reprtof the salaries commission and it confirms what i have suspected all along we have fallen far behind our counterparts in the private sector and we are way behind the curve of what it costs to raise our families and represent our constituents but i will leave the needs argument to others my children are grown and educated my home in chicago i paid for and chicago is clse enough that i can afford to get there when i need to i want to talk about what we deserve not what we need it seems to me that we are divided into a number of different groups when it comes to setting our rmte of pay there are some of us who feel we are not worth more than 77 400 others feel we are but also feel that the people who send us here dont agree with us and would not send us back then there is an apparently small band of us who feel we are wortl more maybe a lot more and that we are willing to take that case to our constituents ill tell you what i would do if i could setup a new system i would establish a range of salaries and have members signin somewhere in that range i would use the current salary as the low end of the scale and the commissions latest recommendation as the high end so for this congress the range would be from 77 400 up through 135 000 at the beginning of each congress members would be permitted to signin for a salary somewhere on the scale new members might naturally be expected to start somewhere near the bottom where they would be joined by those not able to justify a higher rate to their constituents or are not willing to try those of us with more responsibility longer tenure and a firm notion of our worth to our people and our country would be free to make that statement openly and honestly by signing in at the high end of the scale this system would give us the flexibility we need for example members who live in high cost areas such as the cities of the northeast and midwest could take that into account in deciding what salary to claim it would be a judgment call of course with dire consequences attached to overreaching salary negotiations are an accepted practice in almost all walks of profes sionl life honest straightforward statements of what a professional is willing to work for and what the employer is willing to pay result in fair compensation for hard work thats all i a i dont expect the people of the united states ever to recognize fully the requirements placed on a member of congress most of our constituents know us through the actions we decide to take or decide not to take not by the work that goes into those decisions i might note that most of the information reaching our constituents is reported by men and women who make a good deal more than we do our constituents read about the perks

that is all we are worth i can tell you right now that i would put myself at the highest end of the scale if the people in the neighborhoods of the eighth district of illinois conclude that having the chairman of the committee on ways and means with nearly 30 years of experience in the house fighting for the retention of essential urban programs on their behalf is not worth 135 000 to them then they will be free to make that clear in the very near future in the next congress they would have the opportunity to address their grievances to a freshman member with a minor assignment and relatively limited means to get the job done on the other hand he would come at the bargain rate mr speaker i know the signin system would never be put in place but im attracted to it because it

washington state and the gentleman from michigan not to have this in the trade bill it passed this house overwhelmingly and i was able to go to the conferees the gentleman from california and other

brought to the floor they are already on record supporting the export of alaskan oil it is part of our trade bill it is part of the republican platform it is necessary to have the right of free trade

were before the trade bill passed this house the term was used of bribery or seeking votes to override the president i do not believe that will happen i have spoken to both of my senators but i think

about the massive number of pages and i agree we did not read it and i agree it was a poorly constructed bill in many areas but when we do recognize a mistake we should rectify it as soon as possible

us to have the opportunity as other states do to export refined products it is right that we erase a mistake made so i urge my colleagues to support this resolution it is the correct way to rectify a

instruction to them to go and find a technological solution that would meet constitutional muster in dealing with this dialaporn problem i did so because i thought that if we could do that we could avoid potentially avoid a supreme court fight when i looked at the result that came back from that conference i was convinced that we should reject that solution because it was inadequate to deal with the problem and that we should send one unified unanimous signal from congress indicating where we stood on this particular issue no we have had several votes in just the last few weeks on where this congress stands and it is unequivocally clear to me and it should be to everyone that the vast majority of the members of this house of representatives is opposed to dialaporn the question then is how do we get rid of it if we could have come up with a technological solution to deal with the problem that removed the dialaporn from access to minors then i would have supported it but let me cite for members who are listening to some of the reasons why this socalled compromise solution the letsfixitteclinologically solution does not work first of all under this approach obscenity is not banned the supreme court has ruled many times as we all know that obscenity is not entitled to first amendment protection and that indecency can be regulated to prevent access by children but under the proposal before us today the obscene and indecent messages over the telephone will be continued to be permitted second the proposed amendment will not solve the problem for interstate telephone calls interstate access to local 976 services or to longdistance 900 services will be allowed to contintie the ability to selectively unblock 976 services everywhere at a customers request is not possible thus the proposed house amendment will not guarantee the immediate use of selected interstate blocking and dialaporn will still be available on an interstate basis third the proposed amendment before us obliges the telephone companies to block only if it is technologically feasible if blocking is not technologically feasible the telephone company is under no obligation to block dialaporn at all further the amendment would inevitably give a rise to disputes over what is feasible who should decide what is feasible et cetera fourth the proposed amendment authorizes the telephone companies to block dialaporn services only if the telephone company does not provide billing and collection services however telephone companies which continue to carry dialaporn services but do not provide the billing and collection thus under this proposal any telephone company that does not offer billing and collection services would be exempted entirely from the requirement to block dialaporn and could continue to carry it finally the proposal gives the telephone company the ability to discriminate among messagjes on the basis of content if we wish to explore contentbased solutions that discriminate against dialaporn messages we should be exploring approaches that would result in the banning of messages which are outside first amendment protection the houses original instruction was to solve the problem not to adopt a solution which is a proposed technical fix but creates additional problems i think the clear message from this house of representatives ought to be that we do not want dialaporn offered on our telephone services in this country we have not been able to come up with a technological solution which guarantees our young people will not have access to this and in fact as i have just indicated there are many loopholes in the socalled technological fix let us send an unequivocal clear united message and let us send it quickly each day that we delay each day that we attempt to find a technological solution hundreds if not thousands of children are getting access to these numbers are calling up and receiving these messages which leave an indelible impression on their minds

national treasure whose waters provided food for our dinner table recreation for our families and a livelihood for so many of our communities was on its last leg from years of uncontrolled activities recognizing this tragedy the federal government joined with state and local govemments in an unprecedented effort to clean up the bay initial studies showed that pollution acted as a nutrient that enhanced rapid algae growth in the bay as the algae grew it consumed greater and greater quantities of oxygen from the water of course madne life found it difficult to survive in an environment with a diminished oxygen supply surprisingly we learned that one of the greatest sources for this pollution was in the form of runoff from agricultural pesticide use animal waste from feed lots and poultry operations and everyday use of chemicals and detergents in homes and businesseslocated hundreds of miles away from the bay the problem was much more complex than we had ever imagined this realization led to two important events in december of 1987 the environmental protection agency the states of virginia maryland and pennsylvania as well as the district of columbia signed an agreement to reduce and control point and and nonpoint sources of pollution in order to improve the health of the bay they agreed to develop adopt and begin implementation of a basinwide strategy to achieve at least a 40percent reduction in these harmful pollutants entering the bay by the year 2000 that same year congress passed the water quality act that was to pave the way for the attainment of these goals this
