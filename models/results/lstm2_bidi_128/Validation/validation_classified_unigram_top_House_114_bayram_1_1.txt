should be working on and i am proud to bring it today number one i dont serve on the oversight and government reform committee that is where this resolution of disapproval has come from i did last cycle i dont this cycle i have heard colleague after colleague come to the floor and defend the rights of not being fired because your sister or your daughter or your son or your brother used birth

after story that is not what this legislation is about that is not a problem that is not something that any of us disagree on we have some legitimate disagreements on this floor and if we pass this rule we will be able to get into the nittygritty of those disagreements but we do not disagree on the freedom of family members to make their own reproductive health choices without it impacting our own employment i will say to my friend sincerely if we can find a case in the district of columbiai dont mean a case this year i dont mean a case last year i mean a case ever of that happeningseek me out as your partner and i will help you because what folks seem to miss here in this conga line of frustration is that if we reject the d c councils resolution we return d c to the law of the land as it exists when today we dont take a single right away from anybody we dont take a single freedom away from anybody we are not interested in doing that whatsoever what we are interested in doing is protecting religious freedom it turns out if you live in washington d c you might work for an institution that lobbies for life you might work for an institution that focuses on faith this is a town of ideas in the rush to pass a piece of legislationthese are not my words these are the words of vincent gray in his letter to the members of the council of the district of columbia in the rush to push this bill through the council did not take the time to protect this cathedral of freedom that we have here did not take the time to make sure that that first and most important of our constitutional freedoms was protected now the constitution is the constitution there is nothing that the district of columbia can do to undermine the constitution but they can cause a lot of problems

talking about clean water in this country that this is about republicans undermining clean water i will say again as i said about the resolution of disapproval if we pass this bill we will roll the regulatory environment of clean water so far back it will be just like it is today that is what we are going to do i just want to be clear about those radical ideas that my friends on the left have suggested if we have the will in this body to pass this bill we are going to roll regulations so far back it will be exactly like it is as i am standing here today what this bill is about is preventing the regulatory overreach going forward guess what i live in gwinnett county georgia i challenge you to have a water treatment plant that does a better job than we do we have a water fountain right there where the sewage gets treated you can go ahead and press that water fountain and have yourself a drink that is how clean it is we put it back into the lake cleaner than we take it out of the lake i will not be lectured by my friends in an executive office downtown about how to clean water in the state of georgia i promise you i care more about clean water in georgia than anyone on pennsylvania avenue does we are succeeding today if we have a problem with state regulation of clean water come to me i will be your partner we will work on that together the problem is not that georgia isnt doing a good job the problem is the feds are planning to get in the way of georgia doing a good job this bill will stop it if we pass this rule we will be able to have that debate finally the bill that makes me the proudest is our concurrent budget resolution my friends have lots to say about why it is this budget doesnt balance lets be clear i believe that they are wrong but what is more important in this discussion is that my friends dont want the budget to balance we had a free and open debate on this floor we considered every budget that any member of this chamber wanted to offer every single one an interesting thing happened every republican budget that was introduced balanced within 10 years and didnt raise taxes on hardworking americans every single budget the democrats introduced never balancednot in 10 years not in 20 years not in 100 yearsand every single one raised taxes on hardworking americans by trillions of dollars trillions of dollars in new taxes and it still didnt reach balance my friends i understand we have a fundamental disagreement about how this country ought to be run and i am glad that we have that debate here in this chamber we are a deliberative body i respect the opinions of my friends i do believe there is a common ground that we can come to but this is that common ground today for years the budget wasnt even passed in the

hard i promise you that my bosses back home in georgia have a much more conservative view of the world than many of the folks do in the united states senate but guess what i dont get everything i want

cancer this is most likely because breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers among women in fact one in eight women in america will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime breast cancer can be a cruel disease it tears mothers from their children wives from their husbands and daughters from their parents in 2015 it is anticipated that in our country alone more than 40 000 women will die from breast cancer while women are most at risk we must remember that this disease does not just affect women while less common in the united states 2 350 men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the past 20 years there have been incredible advances in the research and medicine surrounding breast cancer but there is much left to be done we cant rest until we can prevent or cure this horrible disease again we have already made huge strides in the fight against breast cancer death rates due to breast cancer have been declining since 1989 and women younger than 50 are now less likely to get breast cancer than ever before this is largely due to the awareness that has been raised on the importance of selfexams and yearly doctor physicals however currently 29 percent of insured women are still not receiving mammograms and for women without health insurance the percentage is even higher with 68 percent not receiving mammograms it is extremely important that we continue to place an emphasis on early detection so that we can catch this disease as early as possible and have the best shot at beating it while there are factors like genetics and age that can make someone more susceptible to the disease breast cancer does not discriminate against education upbringing or wealth from ceos in new york city to a stayathome mom in small town minnesota this disease knows no bounds i expect that just about everyone who walks these halls and too many to count across our country have been impacted by breast cancer in some way i am no exception fifteen years ago i lost my sister bridget to breast cancer bridget was only 38 years old when she left us she left behind two beautiful daughters and a husband who loved her while her life was a lesson on how to get the most out of each second of every minute of every hour and every day there is not a day that goes by when i dont wish there could have been a cure for her for those who have experienced personal loss and pain from breast cancer and for everyone who is fighting this disease we join with you this month not only to raise awareness about breast cancer but to sound a call to action to strengthen our resolve and to eradicate this disease once and for all in congress we can absolutely play a role in this effort to the extent possible within our constitutional authority we can and should encourage further advancement of medical research i am proud to be a cosponsor of the accelerating the end of breast cancer act of 2015 which will establish a commission to work to defeat this disease the commission will consist of experts in cancer research who will work to identify opportunities and ideas to advance our quest to prevent and cure breast cancer for future generations october is a month to raise awareness we have made progress and we are making progress in our fight against this unforgiving disease let us use this month to rededicate ourselves to our shared goal of eradicating breast cancer once and for all"], [0.9873051047325134, 0.9873051047325134, 0, "this week the house will take up new sanctions on north korea in response to their nuclear weapons test last week this measure will prevent those facilitating their nuclear weapons program from entering the united states it sanctions financial institutions and seizes assets in order to halt north koreas nuclear weapons program the steps we are taking reflect the type of approach we should also be taking with iran rogue states like iran and north korea cannot be trusted to respect international

of our newer members of the budget committee especially the member from arkansas i think the people of arkansas were right to send him to congress not only does he come ready to identify the spending problems that this country has but he comes ready with solutions too and i think that is in essence the definition of leadership i thank the gentleman i also thank the gentleman from georgia who just spoke he speaks so eloquently on so many subjects a member of the rules committee i am also very appreciative of his contribution to the budget committee he of course as we all are today and almost every day unfortunately was talking about the debt and let me just put it in a pictorial form this is the new red menace look at that trajectory it goes nearly vertical so the question is how do you turn that big ship that titanic if you will so number one it doesnt sink this entire country and number two it gets on a more meaningful more productive course so that we can continue to be the worlds best hope in a 21st century world now some especially those on the other side of the aisle will immediately turn to the fact that there are two ways to in fact solve this problem one is to control spending the other is to grow revenue let me talk about the latter for just a second the latter is a false choice because at 10 000 people a day retiring into unreformed social programs that trajectory will not turn around it will not plateau no matter how much property you confiscate from the american people no matter how much you take in the form of taxes with 10 000 people a day retiring in unreformed programs can you get that to go down so lets look at that more closely this is what the federal government confiscates from the american people to run itself in fiscal year 2015 it was 3 25 trillion revenue we took in to run the operations of just the federal government the american people know we dont have a revenue problem we have a spending problem the question should be what cant you do what cant you do with 3 25 trillion of property confiscated more revenue is not the answer thankfully the majority here in the house of representatives doesnt think it is the answer either we know we can do better we know we have to do better for the american people we know we have to control the spending that is why i am very proud to be part of a committee the budget committee and part of a new crew that came starting in 2011 that for every year we have put in a budget a narrative something that we dont legally have to do as part of the budget process but we took the extra step to put a narrative in our budget to give the solutions that are needed to correct this debt problem reforming medicare reforming medicaid putting us on a track that will reduce that red menace that will plateau it and start pointing it downward over the next generation we took the political risk to have that conversation with the american people and we have done it every year since 2011 some people called it the third rail of politics touch it and you will be politically electrocuted well we touched it and we touched the next year and the next year and the year after that and my hope and my pledge is on this house floor that we will continue to have that conversation with the american people backed up with votes that show really how to solve this problem i will refer us to the spending that i am talking about this chart was used before by the gentleman from arkansas i will refer to it again here is what is on autopilot here is what needs to be reformed and if you look at one piece of that pie there medicaid a solution for that has been in our budget for the last 5 years in the remaining time i have i want to talk about that solution a state flexibility grant block grant if you will we have had that idea in our budget for the last 5 years it is the idea that we in the federal government we are going to get out of the business of medicaid we are going to get out of the business of deciding who is poor in terms of health care what the poor need in terms of health care or how the poor get it that health care service we are going to give it to the states to individuals to locally elected officials people who know their communities better in fact than any federal bureaucrat does people who can determine given a finite amount of money from us their money back in fact what the poor need who the poor really are who the disabled really are what they should get in terms of healthcare services and how they should get it maybe like the gentleman from arkansas alluded to earlier maybe there ought to be a work requirement for the ablebodied ones of them maybe there ought to be other conditions but let the states decide what that would be pressured in a good way by the fact that there would only be a finite amount of money coming from our budget that would allow us to know exactly what we are in for as a federal government exactly what we are giving out and not a cent more and would naturally incentivize the states to innovate to come up with better ways of service to serve those who really need health care who cant get it any other way and those who in fact are gaming the system will be naturally forced off the states are in the best position to provide that when they are properly incentivized with a finite amount of money that doesnt grow over time the republican budget for the last 5 years the one that has passed this house of representatives has done that very thing we are on the right track we need to continue these votes we need to continue to have a budget we need to continue to have standalone votes on these reforms to take this issue to the american people especially in a presidential election year when frankly the candidates i havent seen them talk enough about what is really on peoples minds and that is how they are going to leave their children and grandchildren with a better life than they have when we are knowingly saddled with 19 trillion in debt a very hard thing to do in fact i think this is the first generation in american history that is poised to leave the next generation worse off i refuse to let that happen on this budget committees watch and that is why we are here today that is why we are providing the leadership i thank the gentleman very much for his leadership"],

announced for president of the united states i am grateful for every one of them i have never seen such a field of candidates that step up and want to serve this country from the oval office the high quality of the character and the integrity that they have the varied experience and the success that they have demonstrated in their lives there have been a lot of easier times to win the republican nomination than there is now as i look at the candidates that are out thereand i have been tuning my ear encouraging themi have yet to hear any of the candidates deliver a compact inclusive approach to how to defeat islamic jihad i listen to them speak and i like the components that i hear from them one of them says we win they lose i like that but how are we going to do that we need a strategy one of them says if you attack us we will kill you okay well lets kill them first that is fine with me they have declared war on us isis for example has established a caliphate they declare it to be a caliphate it is a caliphate in northern syria and in north and western iraq that real estate that they control is a caliphate and they threaten all of the rest of the region and they threaten us they say that their black flag is going to fly over the white house well some would say that will be a cold day we have seen some dramatic changes in history over the last few years i would say to the united states we need to step up to this we need to recognize our enemy we need to defeat our enemies our enemies are islamic jihad and islamic jihad is comprised of the element within islam that believes that their path to salvation is in killing us and that they can bring out some kind of worldwide revolution where in the end it will just be the purest of the pure of islamists that are left on the planet they will have killed everybody else and all whoever is left must knuckle down to sharia law we need to defeat the ideology and when i say defeat the ideology and i am speaking to a group of people i will often see that look on their face such as why do you think you can defeat an ideology you cant defeat an ideology you cant change a culture you cant defeat ideology i recall one of those rebuttals that came to me and i said tell that to the japanese in fact in world war ii in a 31 2 year period of time this country with our allies very powerfully this country defeated three ideologies the ideology of japanese imperialism the ideology of italian fascism and the ideology of german nazism all three of those ideologies went down in flames in a 31 2 year period of time in the face ofi will say this mr speakerthe superior culture the western civilization a superior culture that has a robust free enterprise that has people that volunteer to engage in the economy into the military that reach out and pull each other up the ladder this robust united states of america coupled with our allies reaching across the map of western civilization rose up rose up and defeated three ideologies in a 31 2 year period of time in the second world war and then it took on a fourth ideology which was the russian version of communism that took about 45 years they were a little more tenacious it was not then just a kinetic operation it wasnt just going up in flames i am grateful that it wasnt instead it was the economic and then political collapse of the soviet union brought about this way ronald reagan saw this margaret thatcher saw it margaret thatcher went to ronald reagan and said with mikhail gorbachev i have found a man with whom we can do business i dont quite understand the motive of gorbachev and he seems to have a little bit of revisionist history that comes out of him from time to time but i also know that pope john paul ii traveled throughout areas of europe and went into poland and told them do not despair because they could be a free people the forces of the ideology of western civilization western christendom as churchill described it in his speech in fulton missouri are the forces that stood up against russian communism in about 1984 when jeane kirkpatrick stepped down as ambassador to the united nations under reagan she made a statement upon her departure which was this she said what is going on in this cold warand that was near the height of the cold warwhat is going on is monopoly and chess on the same board the united states and the soviet union are playing chess and monopoly on the same board it is just that the only question is will the united states of america bankrupt the soviet union economically before the soviet union checkmates the united states militarily that was the question it was succinctly put and i believe that will also show up on her wikipedia page but i happened to find it in the des moines register back in that year 1984 jeane kirkpatrick was right five years later the soviet union imploded on november 9 the wall went down in berlin and that was a symbol actually i will say literally the iron curtain came crashing down throughout berlin and the iron curtain all across europe went crashing down people flowed freely back and forth the free world had defeated the ideology of communism that was the soviet version of it for a time freedom echoed all the way across eastern europe all the way to the pacific ocean and it can be restored again that is the foundation that we have that we work with we are the people thatbecause of free enterprise because we have idea people with good educations and a solid moral foundation and a good work ethic this country has generated more patents than anybody else created more inventions than anyone else but cooperated with especially the western world and with the creativity that we have we have been able to rise up against ideology after ideology defeat three of them during world war ii and defeat soviet communism in a 45year period of the cold war now we are faced with another ideology that rises up to challenges islamic jihad if you go back to the time of mohammed about the last 20 years of his life and for 100 years after his death there was a conquest going on ofshall i call them religious conversions by the sword and as the conquest was going on islam was invading and occupying most of the known world at the time by 732 ad the islamists were outside the city of tours in france when charles martel brought his infantry into the trees to face the cavalry charge of the islamists and cavalries dont operate very well in the forest and that is how the charles martel charles the hammers infantry defeated them there and chased them out of tours and across the plains and left their bones scattered a long ways back towards spain that was 732 ad and you can fastforward again and again to catch some of the milestones in 1571 the battle of lepanto where an islamist navy was sunk by the holy league navy that went to meet them in the aegean sea you can go to 1683 when vienna was surrounded by islamists of the time on july 14 they surrounded vienna and for more than 2 monthsthey besieged vienna for roughly 2 months and then on september 11 the three german infantries under three german kings and jan sobieski the polish king brought his cavalry they held a service at kahlenberg church which was razed it was in ruins at the hands of the islamists but they held a service there in the evening of september 11 and prayed for gods deliverance of their battle the next day that it already enjoined on september 11 and the deliverance of vienna which happened as in the famous battle of vienna september 11 and 12 it goes on then september 11 became the date that lived in infamy for the people who attacked us on september 11 2001new york pentagon and pennsylvaniaand then again on september 11 2012 benghazi that date means something to them it ought to mean something to us they have been fighting western civilization for 1 400 years and they have been adapting themselves to the technology that is created in the western world creating very little themselves but borrowing our technology and some of that technology that is now being borrowed is the internet the internet that is being used to inspire and to recruit and to direct the islamists that are attacking americans and attacking people that are not in alignment with isis and with islamic jihad that is the effort that is coming and the ability that they have to use the internet to coordinate and communicate they will say as high as 100 000 tweets and emails and communications a day are coming out of isis and islamic jihad in the broader definition of it as high as 100 000 a day we need to bring about warfare against them and it means not just defensive warfare to protect ourselves but offensive warfare to attack them through the same medium that they are using to attack us so here is the list it is not just a kinetic war against them which they have declared against us the kinetic war we need to do cyber warfare financial warfare educational warfare against them we need to build a strong alliance with especially the moderate muslim countries in the middle east those who should be our allies but for being alets say given the short end of the stick from our state department during this administration and i am speaking of countries like egypt the united arab emirates for example jordan to a lesser degree but they are natural allies to the united states they are natural allies in fact they are allies to israel today they have been attacking our islamist enemies in that part of the world the egyptians allowed for planes to fly out of there to fly into yemen and the emirates sent some of their air force there you have seen the saudis do the same thing we can build an alliance in the middle east with saudi arabia whom i have got slightly less confidence in than i do in egypt and in the united arab emirates with jordan and also working in cooperation with israel when president elsisi of egypt says to me that his relationship with prime minister netanyahu is stronger with egypt and israel and president elsisi and prime minister netanyahu stronger than it is with the united states we should be troubled by that we should be troubled by a foreign policy that has alienated the egyptians that has caused the uae to wonder what is america doing why are we paving the road to damascus for our enemies why would we consider doing such a thing so this strategy a strategy that i have put into an oped in the national review which was just published here in the last couple of days lays out a strategy to conduct cyber warfare both offensive and defensive and economic warfare to shut off the funds that are flowing to islamic jihad wherever they might be flowing from wherever they might be flowing through whoever might be doing business with them and thinking they are going to profit we have got to turn that the other way and then we need to shut down and shut off if we canand this is the most difficult component of the taskthe educational system out there that is teaching this kind of hatred into the next generation build alliances with the moderate muslim countries as i have said encourage them we need to be arming the kurds with everything that we can get to the kurds everything the kurds can use and that doesnt mean send it through baghdad to get the baghdad stamp of approval it means directly to the kurds along with special operation forces that could be on the ground with the kurds and call in airstrikes and support the kurds as one jaw of the vice that will squeeze isis in iraq and in syria the other jaw of the vice is a natural it is already there it is assad and when those two jaws of the vice to come together and crush isis by that point we can take a look at assad and decide how to approach the power that may be left in syria at that point in time this is just a quick list of a strategy to defeat the ideology of islamic jihad the time has come for us to do that i want to see a presidential candidateor 16 of them i hopewho can articulate a vision to bring about the defeat of this enemy that has been bringing battle against western civilization for 1 400 years that targets the united states of america as the great satan and the center of their efforts they would like to destroy all of the united states of america and while this is going on we have got a treaty proposal from the president of the united states with iran in the spring or summer of 2008 as a candidate he said to iran mr ahmadinejad if you will unclench your fist we will extend our hand i would remind the public of that because that fist is still clenched in iran and the president is poised to hand over 150 billion to the iranian economy that will juice that economy up it will allow them to bring conventional weaponry to bear it will allow them to fund more hezbollah it will allow them to continue to develop the most recent version of centrifuges and even if they comply in 10 years the situation is set up where rather than one weapon it is 100 weapons icbms sticking out of the sand in the middle east there is much to be done for this western civilization we need to strengthen our culture we need to believe in who we are we need to sort the best things out of what we are and strengthen them we need to cull out the weaknesses that we have and we need a leader whom god will use

to prevent a solution we cannot allow maduro to continue the charade of a dialogue as a stalling tactic a referendum must occur this year the people demand it because if it doesnt then next year maduro can step aside hand over power to his vice president and the same abusive regime continues while not addressing any of the underlying problems if a dialogue does occur all sectors of the venezuelan opposition must be at the table that is only fair but it cannot happen if some of them are in jail and a precondition to any dialogue must include the release of all political prisoners the regime could show a goodfaith effort by doing this but instead it continues to go the other direction it continues to go backwards postponing the appeal of a political prisoner leopoldo lopez indefinitely after it was scheduled to occur just 2 days ago with its repression its corruption and its disastrous economic policies the maduro regime is running venezuela into the ground and it is no wonder that venezuelans feel like they are under siege riots are occurring on a daily basis and according to one recent study 87 percent of venezuelans say they dont have enough money to buy enough

a more troubled place i personally think the deal sets a dangerous precedent it strengthens the largest state sponsor of terror in the world and gives that state sponsor of terror a pathway to nuclear weapons at some point in its future i think that all of the arguments to defend this deal cant stand against the great weight of reality including the fact that iran isnt holding up its side of the bargain and is more interested in embarrassing american military men and women than in becoming a responsible nation i understand a few people disagree however there is something we have always agreed on from the start deal or no deal good or bad deal we have always agreed to hold iran accountable for terrorism for its development of ballistic missiles and for its human rights abuses committed against its own people in april alone president obama said we have to hold iran to account where it is acting in ways that are contrary to rules and norms secretary kerry said last year we will never ever stop standing up for the iranian peoples rights treasury secretary jack lew also said last year we are going to continue to prosecute our unilateral sanctions on things like terrorism on things like regional destabilization and human rights what about today iran has conducted eight ballistic missile tests since the deal was signed the state departments own stephen mull said in may there have not been any sanctions imposed for human rights grounds since july of last year iran continues to imprison journalistsamericansand to torture its people in february the administrations director of national intelligence james clapper said iran continues to be the foremost state sponsor of terrorism iran and hezbollah remain a continuing terrorist threat to unitedstates interests and partners worldwide those are the facts right there what has the obama administration done how has the administration held iran accountable as they said they would the administration has done nothing and it only gets worse german intelligence has found that iran is violating its pledges under this nuclear deal iran is procuring material for nuclear weapons in what is by international standards a quantitatively high level coupled with its missile program the report reads it is safe to expect that iran will continue its intensive procurement activity wasnt this deal supposed to stop iran from developing nuclear weapons where is the accountability where is the administration when they so clearly said they would hold them accountable where is the bipartisanship in the sanctions now now i understand on the other side some will accuse republicans of engaging in a purely partisan exercise and never intending to work with our friends on the other side of the aisle well you know that is just not true you know for the last 6 months we worked with the other side of the aisle we worked in a bipartisan manner with the chairmen on both sides but every time we would deal with the missiles and the ballistic sanctions against them the white house would thwart any bipartisan effort so why are we here today it is because for 6 months he found every reason to say no for 6 months he went back on every word that was said about holding them accountable when the facts stood before us frankly i dont understand opposition to this bill we are simply holding iran accountable which is exactly what the administration said they would do we have had tremendous leaders in this country and we have learned the lessons time and again ronald reagan taught us this lesson that peace without freedom is meaningless human nature craves that we all have peace but you cannot secure peace without freedom we have watched in history when leaders have failed chamberlain peace for our time but there was no freedom in that ronald reagan had this same dilemma late in his second term in iceland when he stood across from gorbachev trying to negotiate a reduction in nuclear weapons he was securing almost everything that he had asked for but gorbachev asked for one last item he asked that america would end their sdi program reagan didnt say no he said we will share it with you so the world can be safe but gorbachev said no reagan had a decision to make he could have signed that deal and i am sure the elite would have probably given him the nobel peace prize other presidents have won them but he realized there was no freedom in that agreement so he got up he held the soviet union accountable and he walked away had he not would the berlin wall have collapsed had he not would the soviet union have collapsed words have meaning and words have consequences the quotes from this administration and from around the world were to hold iran accountable that is what is happening today there are going to be some members in this chamber who will sit back and say but it didnt happen just the way i wanted it to before it came to the floor i dont want you to look your grandchildren in the eyes

he confessed his racist and hateful call to action well nbc installing trump as snl host may be good for ratings but it is a bigger deal than a cameo or being a guest on the tonight show i am calling you out if donald trump had said gays and lesbians were murderers and raping americans would he get to host a show it is every bit as much a fiction and a lie donald trump has said some pretty awful things about women individually and collectively but what if he said most women were criminals would the writers be thinking up sketches for trump if he had slandered an entire gender rather than an entire ethnic group trump says he wants to do away with the part of the constitution that allowed freed slaves freed african american slaves to be treated fully as american citizens yes trump thinks we do not need the 14th amendment to the constitution but what if he said that black people were murderers rapists drug dealers would you still pitch skits with donald trump and some lighthearted banter what if all the latino cast members all walked off the job at saturday night live oh wait you dont have any latino cast members i do seem to remember comcast spending a lot of time on capitol hill when they had a merger deal with time warner and they wanted support from members of congress comcast said latinos were so important to them and they had plans to do this and that and the other thing to support the latino and immigrant community what happened the merger didnt go through so you no longer feel the sense of corporate responsibility to the 55 million latinos that live in the usa giving free airtime to people who insult and malign them is now part of your business model i just want to say one last thing to producer lorne michaels i wonder if he had said that canadians were rapists murderers and drug dealers would you be inviting him on snl i place in the record a letter that i sent nbc comcast yesterday"], [0.0006206631660461426, 0.49937933683395386, 1, "i believe this

substantially more unitedstates person communications through its upstream collection program than it had originally told the court with upstream collection the nsa directly taps into international internet cables to search through all of the communications that flow through it looking for communications that map certain criteria four years ago the court found that the government was collecting tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications a year why because all of your data is everywhere no accurate estimate can be given for the even larger number of communications collected in which a unitedstates person was a party to the communication the director of national intelligence confirmed the government searches this vast amount of data including the content of email and of telephone

he wore and bury him and then she subsequently made her way to austria by which this cross came into the possession of the holy father this type of incidentthe killings the beheadings the crucifixions the immolationsoccurs day after day after day to the beleaguered religious minorities of the middle eastthe christians the yazidis and otherswho have ancient faith traditions who have every right to be in their ancient homelands as does anyone else this is a genocide this is a deliberate attempt to exterminate an entire set of peoples based upon their faith in the year 2004 thensecretary of state colin powell came to the united states congress and in a committee hearingthe senate foreign relations committeehe declared what was happening in darfur in sudan a genocide in making that simple declaration using that powerful word he helped put an end to that grim reality thankfully what is happening now that should give the beleaguered communities of the middle east some hope is that there is an international coalition developing that has recognized the fact that this is a genocide being committed nearly 200 members of the united states congress this body have signed on and are cosponsoring a resolution that declares this a genocide the international association of genocide scholars has stated it as such others including the yazidi community the united states catholic bishops pope francis himself hillary clinton and marco rubio both presidential candidates have declared this to be a genocide genocide is a powerful word it evokes special meaning it creates the conditions for when there hopefully is inevitably and perhaps miraculously some proper settlement in the middle eastsecurity arrangements political economic and cultural settlementthat the religious minorities of that area who once made up the rich tapestry of that region will have their rightful place restored and reintegrated back into those communities this would give hope again to persecuted peoples it provides a gateway for the discussion of further policy recommendations for instance that could place people who are being forced to flee under the threat of genocide in proximity to where their ancient homeland is so that once stability is restored they can return and reclaim what is rightfully theirs a little while back when the yazidi community primarily women and children were trapped on mount sinjar president obama to his credit acted quickly the house of representatives had passed a resolution calling for additional humanitarian assistance and the president with great deliberateness decided to save their lives i want to personally state that i am grateful for that i represent the largest yazidi refugee community in america this is an ancient faith tradition that usually enjoyed a quiet and peaceable life in areas of iraq and who began to come under increasing pressure during the iraq war and now are of course subjected to isils attempt to exterminate them they were saved by quick action so in an exchange with secretary kerry today i commended the administration for that quick action to save the yazidis and i asked the administration to actively consider and call this what it is a genocide when we do so again we create the conditions not only for which the international consciousness on this problem will be raised and other international organizations including the european union parliament who have spoken to it other parliaments around the world have also declared this a genocide however in our complicated times we rush from urgency to urgency it is difficult to keep the mind focused because the horrors that continue to come at us are so extreme we almost get numb to it all yet we have to act in doing so we can save lives we can reposition and potentially preserve the remnant of the rich tapestry of minority voices that are critical to stability in the middle east and are critical to saving civilization itself and stopping this grievous assault on human dignity that is why i urged the secretary to make the declaration of genocide it was a thoughtful exchange but we will continue to do so i am so grateful to so many of my colleagues who again have signed onto this resolution that calls it such a genocide against the christian yazidis and others i am also grateful to have some colleagues here including my good friend

act as it makes its way to the presidents desk it is important legislation that will make an impact in the lives of so many girls and young women around the world like last year i am an original cosponsor of the house version of the girls count act and i think that the version introduced in both houses this congress is even better than the one that the house passed last year as it explicitly recognizes the great work that so many faithbased organizations do around the globe there is a need for the legislation because in too many parts of the world girls are discriminated against simply for being a girl indeed this disregard for the value of the girl child often begins in the womb in countries such as india and china where we see the horrific practice of sexselective abortion this cruel practice in turn has led to a gender imbalance which has fed other crimes against women such as sex trafficking bride selling and prostitution i chaired a hearing two years ago on the problem of indias missing girls which addressed the problem of violence against the girl child in india sexselective abortion and female infanticide have led to lopsided sex ratios in parts of india for example 126 boys are born for every 100 girls perhaps the best figures we have concerning the magnitude of the problem come from indias 2011 census figures which find that there are approximately 37 million more men than women in india in china too we see the brutal effects of a onechild policy that causes baby girls to be killed before birth where only one child per couple is permitted in a society that has a traditional preference for sons the predictable resuit is that a disproportionate number of girls will be killed in the womb as mara hvistendahl recounted in a book i recommend to all of my colleagues unnatural selection choosing boys over girls and the consequences of a world full of men in asia alone there are 160 million missing girls roughly the same amount of women and girls as there are in the united states the result of this seximbalance is a world where there is greater political instability with violence inside the womb begetting violence outside as well todays legislation which seeks to have every girl counted and registered marks a small but important step toward a world where every child boy or girl is equally valued and cherished for her or his inherent

maritime coordination improvement act i believe that this bill will provide the department of homeland security the tools and the authority to find efficiencies to improve operations amongst all of its various components in 2003 the department of homeland security was cobbled together from 22 different offices and agenciesa very huge logistical and management challenge we knew that there would be significant growing pains before that agency would function well and as a unified department each component of the department be it customs and border protection or immigration and customs enforcement or the unitedstates coast guard has a tendency to sort of operate in their own silo without the coordination required to make border and maritime security efforts as successful as they should be and can be this has had a negative effect actually on logistics on communications and most importantly on operations in an attempt to adopt a better structure with a goal of enhancing border security and maritime security operations this legislation authorizes joint task forces on border security the goal of these task forces is to improve border security outcomes and this legislation provides explicit authority to guide the task force operations and to allow this pilot concept to be utilized to secure our borders while this concept is not unique we intentionally provided a sunset date for the joint task force authority to give the next administration the opportunity to come back to the homeland security committee and to the next congress to demonstrate that this organizational structure has really contributed to border security and it is not just simply another layer of bureaucracy the second part of this bill requires the department to take a very hard look at potential efficiencies in its maritime security efforts during my time as the chair of the subcommittee on border and maritime security we held hearings with cbp that address some of the overlap and the redundancies in the maritime environment particularly with the units of the coast guard and the cbp air and marine operations that in many cases are in very close geographic proximity this bill also requires cbps office of field operations the air and marine operations and the coast guard to evaluate their role in the maritime and supply chain security to ensure that their missions are consistent with our current threats and to find ways to consolidate operations where possible we think these steps are commonsense and i certainly think that they will help save our taxpayers a number of dollars and most importantly improve operations and coordinations for our homeland security again finding creative ways to fund the staffing and infrastructure needs at our nations aging ports of entry was really the driving force behind another piece of this legislation which is the permanent authorization of cbps publicprivate partnership program which is also included in this legislation allowing public and private sector port of entry operators and others to enter into agreements with cbp to fund smallscale infrastructure expansion or to fund overtime needs will improve security and as well increase the flow of commerce that is so vital to our economy i want to specifically thank the gentleman from texas who will be speaking in just a moment for offering the amendment during the markup

shuster and representative barletta from the transportation and infrastructure committee for working so diligently with us on this particular provision lastly this bill authorizes the departments office of biometric identity management or obim as we call it for the first time since 2003 biometrics have been a very important part of the nations border security efforts the biometric service obim provides is not limited to any one component it is a department and a governmentwide asset for that reason we believe that it should not be located in a single component like the cbp where the information could again be siloed to the detriment of other department of homeland security components in order for biometrics to be used to their very fullest potential we think we need to appropriately fund and modernize the data systems that power the matching and the collection of biomettic information our borders can and should be secured we believe that this bill provides a framework to really help organize the department for success and to improve the coordination of border and maritime security components whose job it is to secure our great nation lastly i would like

rights that they have created with their own hard work and their own innovative skills the bill that is being marked up is called in fact the innovation act it is one of the worst misnomers that i have seen in my time in congress this should be called the antiinnovation act this is yet the latest of a decadeslong attack on the patent rights of the american people that were placed into the constitution by our founding fathers for decades now large multinational corporations very powerful economic entities that have influence on government have been trying to neuter the patent rights of the american people why have they been doing this why do they want to eliminate or to dramatically reduce the rights of our inventors to control what they have invented because these are big guys who dont want to pay the little guys when they steal from them the fact is that our founding fathers knew it was important for someone who has created something whether it is a writer or an inventor to have the right to control his or her creation for a certain period of time the time period has been 17 years traditionally since the time of our constitution our founding fathers knew this was important to our countrys wellbeing not just in terms of the rights of the individual which we agree with as americans and which were written into our constitution as part of the bill of rights only one place is the word right used in the body of the constitution and that is in the section dealing with providing our inventors and yes our writers with the right to control what they have created for a certain period of time in order to profit from it our big corporations and these multinational corporations that have no loyalty to the united states these people who are continually going overseas to china and elsewhere are trying to neuter this so that they can take any new innovation without having to pay the person who has actually been the inventor and created this that is totally contrary to what our country has been all about we have had the strongest patent system in the worldthe strongest in the world what has that given the american people it has uplifted our standard of living of ordinary people yes these folks in the multinational corporations they live very well well the american people have lived well because we have had the technology whether it is agricultural technology or transportation technology or any of the other type of energy technologies that we have these have uplifted us and created more wealth for our society americans security prosperity and

hard and have natural resources it is our freedom and our respect for the individual rights of our citizens that have given us prosperity and security and freedom now these powerful multinational corporations have targeted our patent system and yes their motive as i say is to steal let the big guys steal from the little guys that is what this supposed innovation act which as i say should be called the antiinnovation act is all about in fact there is a legitimate problem of frivolous lawsuits in our country there is no doubt about that it is not just in the area of technology it is throughout our medicine and everywhere else but there have been a number of people who have taken patent law and claimed rights that they werent given by the patent office and issued frivolous lawsuits to people to try to get them to pay money to them they are called patent trolls this excuse for changing our patent system is a lame excuse in the sense that we dont need to destroy the patent rights of the little guy in order to cure this problem every provision of the innovation actevery provisionlimits the rights of legitimate patent holders in order to protect their own creation
