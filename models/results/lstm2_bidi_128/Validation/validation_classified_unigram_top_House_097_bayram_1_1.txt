in the bill that is before us the bill allows seismic exploration in wilderness candidate areas that is areas that have been recommended by the executive branch for wilderness or areas that have been designated by the executive branch or congress for further wilderness study it does not allow it in designated wilderness that was a compromise that was reached in the bill as introduced and which was reaffirmed by the interior committee by a vote of 29 to 11 this amendment would go further and breach that compromise by opening designated wilderness areas to explosive seismic testing second i would simply like to point out that no less valid a conservative than george will writing in the latest newsweek magazine has this to say and lie supports this bill there are 80 million acres of designated wilderness 56 million of them in alaska i might say parenthetically this bill does not affect alaska at all only 1 2 percent of the lower 48 states is wilderness only 4 percent could ever be so designated surely the nations vitality and security are not so marginal as to depend on that 4 percent we are not dealing with 4 percent today we are dealing only with about 2 percent someday we may have to go into that last 2 percent but not now because we already have 137 million acres under lease and open to oil and gas explorations and development on the public lands in the lower 48 states

sense of our civilization which we so value and our sense of a democratic decent history and yes our sense of morality when we say that the cost overruns of a submarine are more important than the health benefits of older americans my amendment would fully restore the proposed cuts in medicare for fiscal year 1983 in the latta proposal it would restore the recommended 4 85 billion the increase in medicare yes would be offset by a reduction in defense outlays but let me tell you these reductions in defense spending will not jeopardize our national security and i want to comment on this just briefly because i think that it is high time that this congress faced the fact that there are billions and billions of dollars in wasteful spending and abuse in varieties of departments and on in particular is defense now let me just show you a few dozen ways we could offset the 4 85 billion in medicare expenses and transfer it in the defense area let me show the members something this is a computerized list of 132 reports and in each report there are at least 15 or 20 examples of cost overruns this is from the gao and the title is defense spending cost overruns look at this report i am going to show you this one report this is 132 they will just stretch it across there all right now let me give you a couple of examples of what is in these reports these are just a few of the cost overruns i am glad my colleague the gentleman from texas is concerned about this because it is about time somebody is now let me just show you this let us take for example the black hawk helicopter project adding 5 4 billion as a cost overrun from the original contract that is more than the proposed cuts in medicare for the army bowling team the taxpayers pay 106 000 to send them from one state to another to participate in a tournament they said that with proper accounting for contracts if they just used standardized accounting which apparently they do not we would save 4 billion and one of these reports alone cited 16 billion in cost overruns if you are on the armed services coinmittee you probably received the report in march from the pentagon because of the nunn amendment to the fiscal 1982 defense authoriation bill we finally have a provision that if the cost of a weapon goes between 15 and 25 percent or more in a year then of course they have to report back to congress well

want to associate myself with the gentlemans remarks i oppose the amendment president reagans proposal for massive increases in military spending over the next 5 years threatens the security of the entire world if approved by congress these proposals would destabilize our economy erode our defense alliances and accelerate the arms race the presidents defense budget is founded on the unrealistic assumption that an ever more powerful preemptive military force is the key to p secure defense this policy can only lead us toward war i believe that national security and world peace depend on economic strength nuclear disarmament and conventional arms limitations and cooperative international defense agreements the presidents program would undermine these objectives and thus threaten our real national security our nations armed forces must be fully equipped welltrained and thoroughly prepared and i would support a defense budget which would insure this but the presidents proposal greatly exceeds what is needed to maintain such a force he suggests funding for unreasonably expensive nuclear weapons programs such as the mx missile program for unreliable and unproven equipment such as the xm1 tank and for nuclear weapons that would increase the potential for a nuclear conflict such as the pershing and cruise ii missiles the presidents defense budget wastes badly needed federal revenue on a dangerous policy of military buildup the president hopes to more than double military expenditures from 173 9 billion in 1981 to 374 3 billion in 1986 a jump in defense allotments from 24 7 to 37 6 percent of the total federal budget in fiscal 1982 alone he plans a 15percent increase over 1981 to an estimated total obligational authority of 222 2 billion defense spending will be significantly higher still according to the congressional budget office which found the presidents inflation estimates for the 4 outyears to be low cbo determined that defense will cost 6 4 billion more in fiscal year 1982 that the president projects for 1986 defense spending would shoot up to at least 50 billion above the figure the president projects ceo estimates these unanticipated costs would have to be absorbed by the pentagon forcing cuts in programs the presidents proposals clearly exhibit poor economic planning increased dependence on the military budget will force inflation up rapidly and make it vitually impossible for our civilian economy to recover this impact will couple with the presidents proposed tax cuts to worsen our current economic instability i want to remind my colleagues that a similar policy of steeply increased military outlays together with unwillingness to raise tax rates during the vietnam war is primarily responsible for our current runaway inflation abroad the administration is urging out allies to adopt similar policies of expanded military might the presidents stated intention to embark on massive military stockpiling as well as the state departments growing pressure on allies to undertake simultaneous buildups already is beginning to strain unitedstates relations with several nations this policy is raising the risks involved in all international conflicts which might develop no matter how small the damage to our civilian economy which the presidents proposals would do poses a serious threat to national security by weakening the nations fiscal and economic role in the world under his plan we would be caught in a whirlpool of military spending that would drain our economy of its ability to provide social fiscal and military security if we are to be successful at bringing about an economic recovery we must reprogram some of these increases in defense spending toward human services an other civilian activities in the reagan military budget 75 percent of the planned defense increases above president carters proposals for 1982 are targeted for procurement of new weapons systems this would mean that a total of 68 5 billion will be committed to procurement contracts in fiscal year 1982 but much of that money will not actually be spent until 1984 or later when those contracts take effect this largescale lockup of funds will cause a sudden inflation jump by limiting available funds without producing consumable commodities a strong domestic economy cannot be achieved until the economy is made substantially less reliant on military expenditures military spending is a relatively poor stimulus for creating jobs and adds to inflation rather than helping to control it one billion dollars spent on mass transportation would create approximately 26 000 more jobs than the same amount spent on the mx missile system according to the council on economic priorities about the same advantage exists for money spent to create teaching jobs as compared to using it to generate military production this xegative effect of military outlays is worsened by the fact that many of the jobs generated by milltary spending are shortterm temporary positions that actually interfere with longterm resolution of our current employment problems the demands which largescale milltary spending put on competition for scarce resources such as highly skilled technicians and engineers and its upward impact on inflation will prevent the civilian sector from obtaining the resources it sorely needs for growth an artificial competitive advantage is created for militaryrelated industries in obtaining scarce resources by the dominant role pentagon expenditures play in our economy yet a disproportionately small quantity of commodities returns to our civilian economy military increases come at the cost of vital federal programs that serve basic human needs programs that feed people for example will be cut by almost 5 billion and funds for public service employment would be eliminated to save 4 8 billion the inequity of these budget priorities cannot be overlooked macroeconomic studies support the examnples i have given of how the presidents military budget proposals would undermine efforts to improve the economy the world bank and the unitedstates arms control agency for example compiled data which showed that steppedup military spending tends to weaken national economies the study compared the percent of gnp used for military purposes to the growth in manufacturing productivity in seven industrialized nations for the years 196077 those nations which used relatively large portions of their gnp for defense such as the united states generally had lowgrowth rates japan for example gave the lowest gnp percentage to defense ninetenths of 1 percent and had by far the highest annual growth rate 8 8 percent at the other end of the scale the united states put 7 6 percent of its gnp toward defense and had the second lowest growth rate at only 3 4 percent annually i believe the united states faces continued severe economic stagnation as a result of growing military spending historically the policy of the united states has been to develop cooperative defense strategies with ita allies to insure international and domestic security we currently are involved in some 29 formal agreements the nato alliance most prominent among them the nato alliance provides the democratic world with a significant margin of international security both in number of strategic weapons and in strategic planning capability nato countries outspent warsaw pact nations during the 1970s by 207 billion on military goods and possess 3 200 more strategic nuclear weapons a renewed commitment to natoprovided security by the united states and our european allies would create a cheaper and less dangerous world situation than would a unitedstates initiated worldwide arms buildup arms control measures and disarmanent agreements offer an important longterm approach to mutual security and international peace the salt 11 process brought us close to a reasonable check against further nuclear expansion this agreement should be ratified it is a necessary step toward disarmament although salt ii itself falls far short of real disarmament negotiations for reductions in european theater nuclear forces merit strong unitedstates support west german chancellor helmut schmidt recently proposed a freeze on the deployment of our europeanbased pershing 11 and cruise missiles pending negotiations for mutual reductions among nato and warsaw pact nations these missiles clearly increase the risk of a nuclear attack on europe both soviet and unitedstates officials already have give attention to a comprehensive test ban for nuclear weapons that would open a direct avenue to a nuclear weapons freeze negotiations on such a ban should be continued substantial reductions can be made in the presidents proposals for the military budget in five areas without weakening unitedstates defense funding for programs that increase our nuclear weapons stockpile those which simply generate repetitive weaponry weapons which the administration plans to produce even though testing on them is either incomplete or indicates significant problems the tremendously expensive mx missile system and generally the elimination of widespread waste in defense programs production of the trident submarine americas most expensive nuclear weapon in production at a projected 1982 cost of 1 6 billion is one of the unnecessary weapons in the presidents budget the tomahawk cruise maissile which threatens to undermine future arms control measures could be eliminated at a savings of 391 million for fiscal 1982 as well the european theater nuclear forces which i mentioned earlier are budgeted for 932 million for 1982 these missile systems would create a substantial offensive nuclear threat to the soviet union and further polarize the alreadytense european situation antiballistic missiles which would violate slt 1 could be eliminated and thus save 438 million without reducing unitedstates security there are several cases of repetitive weaponry in the current military budget these include the cx airlift planes which the administration plans to begin development of at~ a cost of 250 million for fiscal year 1982 even though the similar c5 transport is not yet fully operational due to production and operating problems f14 and f15 fighter planes which last year received a higher authorization from congress than the pentagon requested are scheduled to receive an additional 2 4 billion but these planes would provide no significant new cappbilities the extremely costly and controversial xm1 battle tank is prematurely budgeted for production at 2 billion in the reagan 1982 budget the reliability and durability of the xm1 was called into serious question both by a department of defense appointed panel of technical experts and by a gao study both investigations expressed doubt that the tank was ready for production the mx missile system is probably the greatest boondoggle of the military budget estimated for fiscal 1982 at 2 9 billion this controversial weapons system is likely to coast more than 100 billion before it is finished possibly as soon as 1986 military experts many citizens and several members of congress have questioned the feasibility and advisability of the proposed landbasing mode for the mx and no alternatives have yet been seriously explored yet the president is actively pursuing deployment of the mx of equally great concern is the direct threat the mx would create to soviet security forcing escalation of the arms race undermining arms limitation talks and substantially increasing world tensions if the president were truly interested in eliminating waste from the oovernmient no department deserves closer scrutiny than the defense department omb director david stockman recently told a congressional committee that pentagon waste was widespread but the administration has thus far avoidcd making cuts there several investigations documented waste in the pentagon in eight major areas one recent investigation of pentagon waste found that a minimum estimate of the cost of military waste is put at 15 billion a year the sources of waste are in many areas of the military and the problem clearly is pervasive needless purchases of goods already in stock performance of unnecessary operations and poor supervision contribute several billion dollars of waste of materials equipment and fuel one study found a complicated overlapping management system among the four branches of the armed services causes costly

gentleman for offering the amendment we have here a very interesting set of circumstances a private facility has received in the last few years something on the order of about 50 million in taxpayers funds to keep open a facility for the reprocessing of spent nuclear materials during that time that was in part justified by the fact that the carter administration had said that there would be no reprocessing privately that ban has now been removed by the reagan administration so a private facility which desires to reprocess can do so i think that is appropriate in addition to that the art and the technology of reprocessing is not new it is well understood for somic 10 years it was done at the west valley facility in new york the technology is understood it is known what is really at stake here the question here is is there any impediment to private citizens and the marketplace permitting technology to go forward and permitting reprocessing to go forward the answer is there is none if there is a market demand for this to take place then the facility will be able to function and the market should carry it but if there is no market then there is no reason why we should be spending 10 million a year to keep the facility going which is ultimately going to probably cost the taxpayers a great deal of money we probably are going to have to buy this if we do not sever the umbilical cord pretty soon it could cost something on the order of about 1 billion we are probably going to be paying 10 million a year to buy ourselves 1 billion white elephant at some time in the not too distant future i do not think that makes good economics i would point out to the members that if there is a market for private reprocessing the barnwell plant can be a success if there is not it will not be the technology is understood we have just the problem of finally saying fellows the free market should function and you should be able to reprocess if you so desire or you should get out of the business if you find there is no market for it there is a real question about whether we ought to go ahead and stuff an additional 10 million down the throat of the administration when they say it is not needed president reagan has indicated in a march 20 memo that he does not believe that it would be appropriate for the federal government to acquire the barnwell plant or to finance construction or operation of any of its facilities it appears to me rather clear the adminis tration does not feel they need the money they do not feel they want the money they do not feel we ought to be financing it in a time when we have budgetary structures when we are cutting everything from eda to school lunches to social security to education to health to faa to navigation safety to the coast guard and all of the other programs we are cutting when we are eliminating money for water and air pollution and we are eliminating programs which would benefit every age and economic class in this society then it strikes me that maybe just maybe this is 10 million that we can well dispense with in the public interest i would urge my colleagues to support the amendment let us sever the umbilical cord let us let these people move out into the private sector and if they can do business let them then do business let them profit and prosper according to that if they cannot let us not continue them as a potential supplicant for the federal government to spend 10 million on a project which is apparently not even near completion for the last few years i have been deeply involved in the energy problems confronting the nation and i fully recognize the importance of preserving all of our present and potential energy options certainly nuclear power is one energy option which should be preserved given our finite fossil fuel resources it is essential for not only our generation but for future generations that we pursue policies which preserve and conserve energy resources the energy that remains in spent nuclear fuel is a potential resource that should not be lightly discarded and reprocessing is the technology that can extract that energy for subsequent use and so i do not speak to you today as one who is opposed to reprocessing the question presently before the house is not one of whether this nation should or should not pursue a policy of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel instead the question is whether the federal government should continue to financially support the mainii 4866 tenance of the reprocessing technology i support the gentlemans amendment because i believe that reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is an activity which should be performed by the private sector we are not talking about supporting the development of a new technology for reprocessing is a known technology which for years was employed by the private sector for 10 years spent fuel was commercially reprocessed at the west valley facility this facility was closed not for technical reasons but for economic reasons when the operators determined that they could not continue to operate the plant prof itably the decision was based upon economics and not technology the west valley experience did not deter the owners of barnwell from undertaking this project work on the project was terminated when the carter administration announced that it was the administrations policy to indefinitely defer commercial reprocessing however despite the previous administrations policy the congress provided funds to maintain this technology during the last 4 years the congress has appropriated over 54 million to preserve this technology the new administration has now changed the nations policy toward reprocessing and the private sector is free to pursue this economic activity the congress has fulfilled its obligation to the owners of this facility by providing funds to them to preserve this technology there are now no legal or adnilnistrative impediments preventing the private sector from engaging the commercial reprocescing of spent nuclear fuel it is now simply a question of economics and in this instance i believe that is a question that should be left to the private sector to decide this is the position of the reagan administration in a march 20 1981 memorandum to secretary of energy edwards president reagan stated i have disapproved the departments request for additional funds for use in connection with activities at the barnwell south carolina reprocessing plant i do not believe it would be appropriate for the federal government to acquire the barnwell plant or to finance the construction or operation of any of its facilities thus this amendment is consistent with the administrations budget request to the congress 1 in closing i should like to note that during the last few days much of the discussion in this chamber has focused on the question of whether the federal government should continue to support some very costly projects of dubious technical merit to date the federal governent has invested only a relatively small amount in the barnwell facility however we must realize that the owners of the barnwell facility are aggressively supporting a bailout in the form of federal acquisition the report of the senate authorizing committee directs the department of energy to submit a study on the feasibility of federal acquisition of this facility unless we terminate federal funding for this project now we will fall into a quagmire of continuing and escalating federal expenditures the congress has fulfilled its obligation to the owners of this facility by providing over 54 million during the last 4 years to preserve this technology the new administration has now removed all impediments to commercial development of reprocessing thus the question before th4 house is one of economics and i submit that as a question which should be addressed by the private sector i urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this amendment"],

federal debts my colleagues are already aware of the massive debts owed to the federal government and of the enormous amount of this debt that is delinquent mismanagement on the part of bureacrats has permitted these delinquent debts to accumulate the details of the problem are described in the recently issued report of the office of management and budget debt collection project on may 18 1981 the house passed h r 2811 a bill designed to help agencies manage their debts in a more businesslike fashion and to make agency debt collection activities more effective that bill was only one step in the effort to improve debt collection practices and to increase the revenue from delinquent debts because agencies have such a poor track record in managing their debts we must recognize that there may be times when agencies need assistance that is what the bill i have introduced today will do it will authorize and regulate the use of private debt collection agencies by the federal government i hope that use of private debt collectors in appropriate circumstances will increase the repayment of debts owed to the federal government i am convinced that use of these private collectors can be done in a way that is consistent with the right to privacy the rules that govern the contracting out of government functions and the laws that regulate debt collection practices this bill is necessary because it is not clear under present law that agencies have the authority to enter into contracts for debt collection services for many years the general accounting office took the position that federal agencies could not legally delegate the debt collection function to private contractors in order to overcome this restriction congress found it necessary to expressly authorize the use of private debt collectors for a specific category of debts in the education amendments of 1976 public law 94482 i was surprised when the general accounting office and the department of justice reversed this interpretation and amended the regulations for the federal claims collection act the amended regulations require agencies to consider contracting for debt collection services this rule change appeared in the federal register for april 17 1981 no adequate reason for the shift in legal position was cited by the general accounting office and the justice department in the explanation that accompanied the rule change i asked the congressional research service to take a look at the issue of the legality of contracting our for debt collection services crs found no clear legal explanation for the change in the opinion of the general accounting office and the justice department it seems to me that if an activity was once considered to violate federal law then it takes a legislative change in order to make that activity legal neither the comptroller general nor the attorney general has the authority to amend federal statutes because of the tremendous uncertainty engendered by the change to the federal claims collection act regulations we need to clarify the law no agency can responsibly rely on the newly revised rule i am concern ed that any action based on this questionable interpretation will lead to significant disruption of agency debt collection efforts it will raise questions of possible liability for aget icies and agency personnel for impriper disclosure of

deficit such excessive cuts in programs for the disadvantaged elderly and women and such exorbitant waste in defense that it is not worthy of serious consideration so the choice is between the jones budget and the latta budget let me start off by pointing out what is wrong with both of these budgets first and most serious both contain unconscionably large deficits over the next 3 years each proposal calls for more than 225 billion more in spending than in receipts our economy cannot tolerate a budget this far out of balance for this long but even on this score the jones budget is preferable since it plots a more direct path to a balanced budget the fiscal year 1983 deficit in jones is 39 percent of the fiscal year 1983 deficit orn the other hand in the latta budget the fiscal year 1985 deficit is 54 percent of the fiscal year 1988 deficit second both contain excessive defense spending over the next 3 years the jones budget increases the defense function outlays by 154 billion over 1982 levels while the latta budget increases those outlays by 174 billion far more damaging to the prospect of a balanced budget in the future is the fact that the latta budget increases budget authority by over 200 billion during the same period clearly some increase in defense spending is needed to maintain our military preparedness increases of the type proposed in these budgets are entirely unnecessary and lead to increased waste fraud and mismanagement the latta budget fails to assert any critical scrutiny to any part of the pentagons plans every weapons system no matter how unnecessary unworkable or expensive is funded in full the presidents plans for civil defense chemical warfare and nuclear weapons are supported with eyes shut and no questions asked the jones budget is better on defense while still shifting too high a portion of our federal resources to function 050 deciding between these two budgets is much easier on the domestic side the latta budget

they want to fund these programs so we are left to wonder whether the latta budget eliminates crucial recessloncaused spending or whether we are meant to take the proposal with a grain or two of salt

aid to family with dependent children and medicaid are cut nearly as much education health legal services energy space transportation are all slashed by huge amounts while the jones budget does make

cap now they will say we have another agriculture bill coming to the floor shortly we are going to have it and it will have something in it dealing with food stamps the committee is also going to have something dealing with dairy price supports in that bill right now we have a problem with all of the dairy surpluses we have accumulated as the gentlemen from the committee knows we have about 400 million worth of surplus cheese we do not know what to do with it we have 400 million worth of surplus butter we do not know what to do with it they are going to have the dairy program in the agricultural bill and it is way above the budget total and the president is not about to sign it so what they are saying is we are going to correct a bill which is not going to become law that just is not going to happen as i say we have a problem that needs correcting these artificial caps ought to cease on the food stamp program before we have 2b percent of the american people on food stamps rather than the present 10 percent"], [0.013324320316314697, 0.5133243203163147, 1, "i move to strike the requisite number of words and i rise in support of the amendment i have been listening to the debate on this particular issue and had read some previous material concerning it and i must say i find this very hard to understand today what everyone is saying reminds me of a group that i talked to a month ago a group that i was explaining the impact of budget cuts to and a member of this groupthis was a group in the business communitysaid to me well we all have to tighten our belts we just understand the president has told us we must all tighten our belts and must sacrifice so i said to the group i said will one member of this audience please stand and tell me what they are going to sacrifice because of these budget cuts and there was not anybody who could tell me anything that they were going to sacrifice in that particular group i would not expect it these were upper middle income business people i do not think the budget cuts are going to hurt them here we are the united states of america still the wealthiest nation in the world saying to a group of puerto ricans who are citizens you are just going to have to tighten your belts like the rest of us only you are going to have to do it more so i do not understand that i do not even think in the sense of fair play of americans that the public would accept that unless someone is prepared to say that the people in puerto rico are not at poverty levels and that they do not need if someone wants to say they do not really need food stamps and that this whole thing is just a giant ripoff and these people are living great if anybody can produce evidence on that i would certainly feel differently on the matter but i do not think that is what anybody is saying so i list fc l that we ought to really be able to say these are people who need the help and people who are entitled to the help"]]}
