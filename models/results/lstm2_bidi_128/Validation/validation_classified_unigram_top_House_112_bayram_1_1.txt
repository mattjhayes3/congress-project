essentially passed as part of a resolution its one thing to say that we want to eliminate medicare the house worked its will through the ryan budget phasing out medicare for those who are under 55 years of age the people of this country will have the opportunity to change that we saw an election in upstate new york where i think and most people think that the people of this country soundly

to phase out medicare for people under the age of 55 likewise in the next election if people run on that a majority might arise in this body that supports keeping medicare solvent for the next generation what was attempted yesterday was circumventing the public will by inserting into the united states constitution exact fiscal policy that essentially wouldnt allow medicare to exist in any form similar to what it is today it would actually specify an exact percentage of the gross national product that the public sector can contain in our governing document this is unprecedented who

well as some commonsense costsaving reforms to the program congress originally passed the public safety officers benefits act psob in 1976 this program evolved from concern that state and local public safety officers and their families were not being provided with adequate death benefits and that the low level of benefits might impede recruitment efforts and impair morale originally the psob program provided only death benefits to the survivors of officers killed in the line of duty it was later expanded to provide benefits to officers disabled in the line of duty and education benefits to the spouses and children of officers killed or disabled in the line of duty congress has amended the psob program many times since its inception some of the changes have resulted in inconsistencies within the law or have unintentionally resulted in a delay in the psob benefit process for example each psob claimant must be examined by an impartial medical examiner who then advises the justice department regarding their decision to award benefits but the psob statute and its regulations require that the medical examiner be hired from the city where the officer was killed or injured this causes significant delays and adds expense in processing psob claims and in administering the overall program the department spends significant time and resources to find a medical professional who is familiar with the psob program and its requirements that medical professional must also be available and agree to perform the necessary medical exam this process can take weeks if not months to complete this bill provides a solution to this inefficiency it allows the department to develop and draw from a pool of trusted qualified medical professionals to perform the necessary examinations across the country this is similar to how the psob program authorizes their hearing examiners this simple change saves valuable time and taxpayer dollars it also ensures that the public safety officers and their families receive these muchneeded benefits more quickly h r 4018 also clarifies who are eligible beneficiaries when an officer is killed in the line of duty currently the payment of benefits is often postponed sometimes for years while the issue of who is the proper beneficiary is litigated this bill creates a new category of beneficiaries adult children of deceased public safety

sunday that israel is becoming increasingly isolated in the middle east and said israeli leaders must restart negotiations with the palestinians and work to restore relations with egypt and turkey its really interesting because it was my impression that it was not israel that had withdrawn from close relations that it was turkey that had actually allowed the flotilla to go challenge a legal and appropriate blockade of the gaza strip from which israel was being bombarded on a constant basis so they had a legal and legitimate interest in ensuring that more rockets did not flow into the gaza strip that would continue to be shot in an effort to kill israelis the reason that the rockets were flying from the gaza strip was because the israelis had had really a rather amazing group of towns there people were making a living there were beautiful homes and greenhouses providing a way in which people could provide for themselves and to grow their own food these were just wellrun communities but the thought that the israeli leaders had apparently was that if we will show this unilateral offer of goodwill to people who in the last 40 years have come to be called palestiniansthey obviously werent for most of the history of mankindbut if they would do this amazingly gracious unilateral act that it would be rewarded and what israel has found is that it has been rewarded with rockets flying into israel in an effort to try to terrorize and kill israelis previously years before that israel had made an offer and did provide land from which it had been attacked which it had acquired in southern lebanon lo and behold they were rewarded by being attacked from southern lebanon and having soldiers kidnapped from southern lebanon so its interesting to hear this administration and people from this administration in the top positions talk about how israel needs to restart negotiations that israel is becoming increasingly isolated how israel must reach out more when it seems that each time israel reaches out its hand its hand gets shot at and efforts are made to chop it off this article from the ap from back in october quotes secretary panetta as saying its pretty clear that at this dramatic time in the middle east when there have been so many changes that it is not a good situation for israel to become increasingly isolated and thats whats happening he said panetta said the most important thing now is for israel and its neighbors to try to develop better relationships so in the very least they can communicate with each other rather than taking these issues to the streets the palestinians meanwhile have said they wont return to talks unless israel freezes settlement building and accepts the pre1967 war frontier as a baseline for talks this is somewhat akin to saying well if mexico were to be launching rockets or doing things to terrorize american citizens that if well just go back to where we were before the unitedstatesmexican war then everything will be just fine the united states went to war because of the same kind of unfairnesses that were seen by the founders of this land dennis miller put it this way the founders were willing to go to war when the british simply put a tax on their breakfast drink so in all likelihood they would be standing up firmly for a taking of liberties more so than we do sometimes today in fact if we stood firmly on the liberties of the united states citizens and efforts by others in the world to destroy us efforts by others in the world who have said they will destroy our way of life and they want to destroy our country then perhaps we would be a little safer today i have a resolution that was filedive got lots of cosponsorsit was filed in may of last year and im still in hopes that we can bring this to the floor because this is the response we should have to nations around the world trying to isolate israel we should let them know how we stand with them we stand with people who are democratically elected we stand with people who have the freedom of worship we stand with people who will not terrorize christians terrorize jews or terrorize muslims where all will be allowed to practice their religionany religionand those ought to be our best friends yet to the contrary this nation seems to run to the aid of thoselike in afghanistan right now we were advised last year that the last christian church has now been closed driven out of afghanistan this is the afghanistan that american treasure and american lives were sacrificed to secure what we thought would be a democratic nation where they would choose peace and in fact there has not been peace the taliban have actually increased in number dramatically since the days when we had them on the run had basically defeated them in early 2002 we come back to this resolution h res 271 and it says expressing support for the state of israels right to defend israeli sovereignty to protect the lives and safety of the israeli people and to use all means necessary to confront and eliminate nuclear threats posed by the islamic republic of iran including the use of military force if no other peaceful solution can be found within a reasonable time to protect against such an immediate and existential threat to the state of israel this is the solution when a dear ally of the united states is being isolated by people who want to destroy it and i know thati believe secretary panetta did a very good job at intelligence and i hope he will do as well at defense but we would encourage people in this administration to go look at what has really been said and who has actually done harm to whom and what you find out is that israel has not moved away from being a friend in fact israel had a treaty with egypt and a leader named mubarak with whom this nation had agreements was doing all he could apparently it appeared to keep that treaty to keep egypts word with israel this administration on the other hand saw fit to encourage mubarak to step down and to make way for what seems to be the military and the muslim brotherhood who seemed to have made clear theyre not going to honor the treaty with israel theyre not going to honor what was brokered here in the united states so once again we have a united states administration who seems to have been left with egg on their faces as president carters administration was i dont know if they ever realized it but when president carter thought the ayatollah khomeini was a man of peace and was coming back to iran and that it was a good thing we soon found otherwise by 1979 they were at war with america its just that we didnt recognize that there were radical islamists at war with us until after the attack on 9 11 not even the attack on the world trade center in 1993 was enough to convince us not an attack on the uss cole not an attack on our embassy not an attack on different unitedstates properties around the world it took 9 11 before we realized there are radical islamists that are at war with us even though this administration has seen to the changing of the fbi lexicon where in training fbi agents and others who are in charge with defending our nation its no longer appropriate to use words in the fbi lexicontheyre not thereof al qaeda radical islamist we use radical extremism instead and as some experts on radical extremismin other words radical islamistshave said unless you understand what your enemy believes how in the world can you prepare against an attack from that enemy and as someone else had told me this administration has been in the process of blinding those who are charged with trying to protect us cant use the terms that were repeatedly used in the 9 11 bipartisan commission report at a time when they didnt know it was politically incorrect to accurately classify people who wanted to destroy your way of life so in this resolution regarding israels right to defend itself it seemed that there was no better thing to do than to go to quotes and to the actual history in the region that points out that whereas archeological evidence exists confirming israels existence as a nation over 3 000 years ago in the area in which it currently exists despite assertions of its opponents its been amazing having been over in israel in november and seeing the results of excavations under what they now know is the city of david in existence about 1 600 years before muhammad was born its just amazing now all of the evidence thats being found archeologically that substantiates exactly what israelis have been saying for years the resolution says whereas with the dawn of modern zionism the national liberation movement of the jewish people some 150 years ago the jewish people determined to return to their homeland in the land of israel from the lands of their dispersion whereas in 1922 the league of nations mandated that the jewish people were the legal sovereigns over the land of israel and that legal mandate has never been superseded whereas in the aftermath of the naziled holocaust from 1933 to 1945 in which the germans and their collaborators murdered 6 000 000 jewish people in a premeditated act of genocide the international community recognized that the jewish state built by jewish pioneers must gain its independence from great britain whereas the united states was the first nation to recognize israels independence in 1948 and the state of israel has since proven herself to be a faithful ally of the united states in the middle east whereas the united states and israel have a special friendship based on shared values and together share the common goal of peace and security in the middle east whereas on october 20 2009 president barack obama rightly noted that the united statesisrael relationship is a bond that is much more than a strategic alliance whereas the national security of the united states israel and allies in the middle east face a clear and present danger from the government of the islamic republic of iran seeking nuclear weapons and the ballistic missile capability to deliver them whereas israel would face an existential threat from a nuclear weaponsarmed iran whereas president barack obama has been firm and clear in declaring united states opposition to a nucleararmed iran stating on november 7 2008 let me state repeat what i stated during the course of the campaign irans development of a nuclear weapon i believe is unacceptable whereas on october 26 2005 at a conference in tehran called world without zionism iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated god willing with the force of god behind it we shall soon experience a world without the united states and zionism whereas the new york times reported that during his october 26 2005 speech president ahmadinejad called for this occupying regime to be wiped off the map whereas on april 14 2006 iranian president ahmadinejad said like it or not the zionist regime is heading toward annihilation whereas on june 2 2008 iranian president ahmadinejad said i must announce that the zionist regime with a 60year record of genocide plunder invasion and betrayal is about to die and will soon be erased from the geographical scene whereas on june 2 2008 iranian president ahmadinejad said today the time for the fall of the satanic power of the united states has come and the countdown to the annihilation of the emperor of power and wealth has started whereas on may 20 2009 iran successfully tested a surfacetosurface long range missile with an approximate range of 1 200 miles and parenthetically they now say they hope to have a missile that would be able to deliver a nuclear weapon from iran to the united states the resolution says whereas iran continues its pursuit of nuclear weapons whereas iran has been caught building three secret nuclear facilities since 2002 whereas iran continues its support of international terrorism has ordered its proxy hezbollah to carry out catastrophic acts of international terrorism such as the bombing of the jewish amia center in buenos aires argentina in 1994 and could give a nuclear weapon to a terrorist organization in the future whereas iran has refused to provide the international atomic energy agency with full transparency and access to its nuclear program whereas united nations security council resolution 1803 states that according to the international atomic energy agency iran has not established full and sustained suspension of all enrichment related and reprocessing activities and heavywaterrelated projects as set out in resolution 1696 2006 1737 2006 and 1747 2007 nor resumed its cooperation with the iaea under the additional protocol nor taken the other steps required by the iaea board of governors nor complied with the provisions of security council resolution 1696 2006 1737 2006 and 1747 2007 whereas at july 2009s g8 summit in italy iran was given a september 2009 deadline to start negotiations over its nuclear programs and iran offered a fivepage document lamenting the ungodly ways of thinking prevailing in global relations and included various subjects but left out any mention of irans own nuclear program which was the true issue in question whereas the united states has been fully committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the iranian nuclear threat and has made boundless efforts seeking such a resolution and to determine if such a resolution is even possible whereas the united states does not want or seek war with iran but it will continue to keep all options open to prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and whereas israeli prime minister netanyahu said in january 2011 that a change of course in iran will not be possible without a credible military option that is put before them by the international community led by the united states the resolution ultimately says that in addition to condemning the government of the islamic republic of iran for its threats of annihilation it supports using all means of persuading the government of iran to stop building and acquiring nuclear weapons reaffirms the united states bond with israel but ultimately no 4 says that in this resolution we express our support for israels right to use all means necessary to confront and eliminate nuclear threats posed by iran defend israeli sovereignty and protect the lives and safety of the israeli people including the use of military force if no other peaceful solution can be found within a reasonable time now we know that in may of last year president barack obama addressed the americanisraeli pac here in washington d c and one of the statements that has not been lost on israel and should not be lost on the people who elected president obama and it certainly hasnt been lost on iran the president made this statement israel must be able to defend itself by itself this was made may 19 2011 israel must be able to defend itself by itself ever since the president made those statements it certainly seems that israel has taken the presidents words to heart and yet instead of the united states doing as had been promised on many occasions standing by israel our great ally instead our defense secretary knowing that hes talking to a washington post reporter knowing that its not on background knows that it will likely be reported basically uses the opportunity to alert the nation whose leaders say they want to wipe israel off the map annihilate israel annihilate the united states basically tells iran hey heads up israel may be coming in the next few months look out israel may be coming in the next few months its still a mystery why our defense secretary and hes a very smart man why he would make such a statement without authority because hes not subject to the slips like outing seal team six as the ones who took out osama bin laden or outing the undisclosed location as the vice president has done hes a man not subject normally to those kind of gaffes this defense secretary warns iran as if the pressure behind the scenes this administrations been putting on our dear friend israel was not enough so now weve got to alert israels enemy iran i hope that the administration will come out and give a good and legitimate answer to how such a warning to iran helps israel and i would commend to anyone interested in going online and reading in the jerusalem post an article dated february 7 2012 by my friend caroline glick titled our world obamas rhetorical storm i would commend that to everyone the truth is we should stand by israel iran with nuclear weapons is a threat to us not merely to israel and this nation should not leave it to israel without our best bunker busters without our awacs without our satellites without our stealth technology we should not put them in the position of having to defend us with lesser weapons capability and i hope and pray that this administration will look more carefully at who the real enemy is look more carefully at which nation was willing to come back to the peace table willing to freeze the development of new housing areas and which one was not and which one of the nations which one of the groups of people in this case the people of the west bank the palestinians their complete refusal to even recognize israels right to exist their continuing teaching of children in the palestinian areas that the israelis are occupiers of palestinian land its throughout the teaching of the children in the palestinian areas and theyre doing that with our

secretary shall not issue a permit without ensuring that the proposed drilling operation meets critical safety system requirements and oil spill response and containment requirements it fails to make mention of and omits requiring the secretary to ensure that critical environmental and economic laws are adhered to a prolific problem leading up to the deepwater horizon spill for years an ongoing problem in issuing permits for offshore drilling has been the department of the interiors failure to follow requirements set out under our nations foundational environmental protection laws and fisheries laws these laws like the endangered species act the national environmental protection act the marine mammal protection act and the magnusson stevens fishery act protect wildlife as well as fisheries and beaches that sustain the gulfs fishing and tourism industries in the gulf region the number of jobs dependent on tourism and fishing is five times the number of jobs related to the oil

administration or noaa is partially responsible for protecting endangered species and marine mammals it said on repeated occasions that drilling in the gulf does affect these animals thats simply science the records show that permits for hundreds of wells including the bp disaster well itself were granted without getting the permits required under existing federal law federal records show that noaa instructed the minerals agency that continued drilling in the gulf was actually harming wildlife and needed to get permits in compliance with federal law but sadly those permits were never sought with regard to the national environmental protection act the government has time and time again performed cursory environmental assessments failed to integrate nepa analyses with related federal

appreciate that recognition and i appreciate the input that has come from the gentlelady from north carolina i came down here to change the subject but i wanted to speak about regulation and ill just wrap up those thoughts that i had before the clock ticked down and take it over to this as i emerged into the construction business that i identified i found myself doing seminars with other people of the same profession around the fivestate area in the upper midwest with our trade association the land improvement contractors of america in that fivestate area as i traveled around and held those seminars i began to ask the questions of selfemployed people most of them had started the business themselves and they were employers doing this in the kind of way that we need to encourage more americans to do rather than discourage them with regulation i began to ask them how many agencies regulate your trade as i asked that question there might be 60 to 70 contractors in a room and we would begin to write down the names of those agencies and yes some of them were divisions within the agencies you can start with the irs and the epa and you go on and on and on osha the mine regulators it continues on but we came to this number of our little narrow trade group 43 different agencies that regulate us and we needed to know the regulations from 43 different agencies we needed to be able to anticipate how they would interpret those regulations and how they would enforce them and then you also had to calculate when they contradicted one another what the likelihood would be of one entity showing up one agency to regulate you versus another if they had conflicting regulations then you ran your operation to try to comply with the one thats most likely to show up to regulate in contradiction with the other that goes on in america every single day there are floors and floors of lawyers and administrative experts whose job it is to try to keep those companies from avoiding the conflict that comes from federal regulations and of course our state regulations that are part of that as well it is a great frustration to enter into a business wanting just to provide that good or that service and do it with in a marketable competitive way to have a margin of profit and control your destiny and raise your family and do those things that are acting out the american dream and find out that a lot of your life is really just tied up in meeting with government regulations and serving this congress and dealing with so many people that can control the destiny of some 300 million americans who have never signed the front of a paycheck who have no idea what its like to not maybe have any capital and go out and build a little bit with some sweat equity and take that little bit of capital and roll it and invest it and after a while find enough margin out there and enough customers that youre compelled to hire a person to help you now theres two people working there instead of one and then you multiply that again and you take some more sweat and your little bit of equity and now you get to double up the equity and now you get to have another employee and another while thats going on youre building a capital base that bridges you through the hard times and the attitude especially over on this side of the aisle is an attitude that employers somehow are victimizers of the proletariats ladies and gentlemen i would say to you that those folks here in this congressand most of them are over on the liberal side of this aislebelieve that employers are victimizers and that employees have a certain virtue to them ill just say that we have good and evil in all of us but the people who risk their capital and many times put everything they have on the line and help stand to lose it all if it doesnt work theyre not taking advantage of the employees theyre giving the employees a job republicans over on this side we say jobs jobs jobs well yes we want those jobs i dont believe that government creates the jobs i think we should stop saying we need to create jobs we dont we need to get government out of the way so that investors can see an opportunity for profit and if they see that opportunity for profit they wont just invest their capital or their sweat they will produce the kind of jobs out there that will sustain people in a market economy thats what needs to happen because first there have to come profits you cant pay payroll very long if you dont have profits which means that youre not going to have jobs unless people make money so what do we do in this congress you people over here you want to punish those people that are making money on this side of the aisle we dont want to call those people that are punishing the people that are seeking a profit because were saying we want jobs we should all say we want to see profit in these companies so that that profit gets reinvested and more people have an opportunity to go to work and receive a paycheck and perhaps a raise and a better benefits package and maybe if that profit gets so great in those companies theyll spin off of there and the people that learn the business going to work for the boss end up in competition against the boss thats another thing that is the american way these kinds of things need to happen organically over and over again in america millions of times and if they dont happen then this country devolves itself down into a europeanstyle social democracy its hard for me to even say those words and think of america in that fashion weve moved in that fashion dramatically the president of the united states doesnt believe in these things that i have described that i think are good hes advocated this keynesian economy on steroids hes advocated for spending trillions of dollars borrowing it about half of that money by the way is borrowed from the investors in america who believe that unitedstates treasury bills are the safest place to put their money and actually it may be if youre going to talk about global currency the other currency has gotten unstable too the euro is in a very unstable unbalanced condition right now they have spent money in the european unionmoney that they didnt have they have built a government bureaucracy much heavier than needed to be ive twice been to greece this year and they have their head in the sand in my opinion they believe that they are the first of a multiple dominos in the eu and that theyre only 2 percent of the gdp of the european union and if theyre not bailed out by the euand that means yes loan guarantees but it gets down to debt forgiveness at a certain pointif theyre not bailed out at a certain point if they default then they will move away from the euro the currency and pick up the drachma again and print their money back in greece a second time or again if that happens they think the euro becomes less stable if the greeks arent involved in it they argue that theyre a domino so if theyre not held up propped up by the rest of europe then theyll fall as a domino and if that happens the euro will start to tumble by the way their domino will clip italy portugal spain ireland belgium name your country over there well it may or may not be true its hard to look at greece and argue that they are a domino and if they fall that theyll necessarily hit one of those other unstable countries that will also fall into one and the other and the other and it will start this cascading effect through the dominos of those unstable countries in europe might not be true it might be true that greece could have a firewall built around it and if they default they default and theyd have to rebuild their country from bottom up inside out back to production again i hope that this doesnt happen in greece i hope that theres a stable economic environment that grows out of europe were tied to them financially with hundreds of billions of dollars invested over into the european banks if they should fail then it hurts us badly were also highly leveraged in this country the comparison of us to greece is one that is considerably disturbing there is a good side to a potential greek default and that would be that it would give this congress a lesson for what america needs to do to avoid a similar calamity i would like to see us steer our way out of this but were here having a debate in this congress about minutiae in proportion to the scope of the problem that we are in we came into this new congress with a new speaker john boehner we have an opportunity with 87 new freshman republicans that came here most of them pledged not to raise the debt ceiling most of them pledged to bring us back to fiscal responsibility and fiscal accountability they all believe that to this day i dont think theyve lost their beliefs but along the way there were a lot of big decisions that needed to be made without time to analyze and so what happened i said the first thing we needed to do was repeal obamacare repeal obamacare repeal obamacare i cant say it enough we need to repeal obamacare if were going to have a country that will function and operate economically again it drives us so deeply into debt that just removing a couple of those components of obamacare according to denny rehberg the chairman of the hhh appropriations committeehealth and human services appropriations committeeit would cut our spending over the next decade by 1 379 trillion it would solve the whole problem of the supercommittee that 1 379 trillion cut that comes just from ending the expansion into medicaid by the way the class act was going to go anyway the administration admitted that they couldnt sustain that component one other component in obamacare was the individual premium subsidy for those who were compelled to buy insurance under obamacare those components totaled 1 379 trillion so we strike those out shut off any funding to that and weve saved that 1 379 trillion that would more than handle the 1 2 trillion that were directed in the debt ceiling deal but this went this way we had a chance coming into this new congress this 112th congress to draw bright lines and to ensure fiscal responsibility and actually fix the real scope of this problem step number one was repeal obamacare we passed that out of this house h r 2 sent it over to harry reid in the senate where he set it up for failure and they shot it down so every republican in the house and every republican in the senate has voted to repeal obamacare congratulations thank you all for doing that we didnt get it done but we got it voted on and its on the conscience of the people that voted no that that monstrosity of a regulation churns its way through consuming 105 5 billion in automatic appropriations that were written deceptively into obamacare in an unprecedented fashion oh yes the tactic had been used before but the scope had never been used like that before and so that 105 5 billion is in there and its around 26 billion in the first 2 years of obamacare this year next year 26 billion being churned away and if we had reached an impasse on our negotiations with the continuing resolution the cr that hit at midnight on march 4 if that had resulted in a showdown that would have been the president causing a shutdown that might have seen the lights go off in federal offices all across the land but you could have driven around the federal buildings here in this city and around the federal buildings across america and where the lights were on in that eventuality they would be on because the money that funds obamacare goes on anyway its automatic they call it mandatory spending and we tried to shut that off as well and we did send the amendment language out of this house of representatives that shut off all of the funding to obamacare and it went over to the senate but it was attached to the bill that went with the cr as an appendage so that they could separate it out and vote it down in the senateand thats what harry reid did in the senate also and so here we are with a congress that began kind of on the right foot with an opportunity to force a showdown with the president of the united states and make him defend obamacare we could have legitimately funded all of the functions of governmentor we could have responsibly funded all of the legitimate functions of government would be a better way to phrase that mr speakerand shut off all funding to obamacare the president of the united states then was predicted to veto a bill like that had he done that he would have had to explain to the american people that his signature piece of legislation obamacare means more to him than all of the legitimate functions of government combined that would have been the showdown it should have been the showdown i believe that we would have prevailed on that showdown and i think the president would have had to accept the funds that we put on his desk in a cr appropriations bill minus any funding that goes into obamacare cutting off all the automatic funding that goes to obamacarecould have would have should have done that we moved past that point the cr was going to be 100 billion in cuts it didnt become that that number went down low enough that ill not utter it just not something that people go back and revisit that even voted for it and then we were going to do yeomans work and cut trillions of spending with the budget bill that came to the floor of the house known as the republican budget resolution that was championed by paul ryan of wisconsin who has done great work here on fiscal responsibility that budget didnt balance for 26 years that was all we could get out of this congress its hard to craft a budget that comes that close he did a lot of hard work on it and laid out some good parameters that we need to pick up and deal with but the budget resolution here on the floor of the house was a promise from ourselves to ourselves that we were going to hold this spending down and this spending allocation was agreed to by this congressby the majority of the house of representatives excuse me the senate hasnt passed a budget in so long i dont remember when and so that budget was passed balancing in 26 years spending too much money leaving us with 23 trillion in national debt 10 years down the road and it was a great step in the right directionnot as strong as i wanted it to be not as strong as the rsc budget which i voted for but the one that could pass that could constrain our spending i voted for them both the rsc budget that balanced in about 9 years and the ryan budget that balanced in 26 years left us with 23 trillion in national debt 10 years down the road that doesnt sound very appetizing to the american public those facts but those facts didnt hold the promise from ourselves to ourselves went kind of out the window when the debt ceiling agreement was presented to the floor of this congress and ultimately passed and in that was a supercommittee in that was a promise to vote on a balanced budget amendment and in that was the threat that if the supercommittee didnt produce a product that could pass the congress and be signed by the president then there would be the sequestrationwhich i dont know where the language of that came from but the sequestration is the automatic cuts that were looking at now i knew when the debt ceiling deal was finally put on paper that we had to go through a number of things one of them was we had to have a debate about how we were going to define a balanced budget amendment well we had that debate and i think i won the debate and lost the decision but nonetheless the clean version of the balanced budget amendment was brought to the floor i didnt call it a clean version i think we needed to have the balanced budget amendment that passed the judiciary committee we should have let the committee work its will the judiciary committee marked up a balanced budget amendment that had a cap at 18 percent of gdp on spending and it had a supermajority in order to raise taxes it was the right thing to do it had exemptions there for a declared war or a case of a serious national emergency and other provisions it was a good constitutional amendment that we could live with that would strengthen this country over the long term we didnt have a vote on that we had the one that said that thou shall have a balanced budget and allows for a tax increase to balance that budget and of course you get to a certain point with tax increases and then you see a decline economically and i think we are past that tipping point today that was another one of our struggles so now were faced with a sequestration im thankful that the supercommittee didnt send us a package that couldnt pass the congress the house and or the senate i never believed that they could they concluded they couldnt reach an agreement there was completely an impasse republicans said were not going to raise taxes and democrats said we arent going to do it if you dont raise taxes they want to punish the people that are producing they would increase the taxesyou guys over there you would increase the taxes on the people that are paying the most taxes you would increase the taxes on the people that are paying the highest percentage you would argue that its progressive and you know youre never going to be satisfied i know you wont be satisfied if i can tell you todayand tomorrow is the first day of decemberthat i have a magic wand and i promise you all that were going to give you what you want and youve got all of the month of december to put your wish list together and when the ball drops in times square in new york on new years eve at midnight and the new year 2012 begins here would be the dealheres the magic wand give me a list of all the things that you want to do to take away the liberty and freedom of the american people take away the wealth and the capital that has been so justly earned by people in this country and redistribute the wealth in the ideal of karl marx or any of the other leftists that you worship grant all of the wishes that you have reorder society according to all your dreams and let you have 30 days to put the list together and at midnight when the ball drops at times square stroke the magic wand give you all your entire wish list if i had that power and if this happened in this fashion i will tell you you guys would work hard your lights are on at night youre well funded and youre smart peopleyoure wrong on your philosophy but you would put together a list and it would be a long list and it wouldnt be without some internal fightsand barney frank will still be there after all so there would still be some of those internal fights going on and in the end if i granted you your wish at midnight at the new year but the deal would be that you had to then stop complaining the rest of your life you would have to live under the rules that you had written that you spent 30 daysall your career wishing and dreaming and working and leveraging for in this congress wed give you everything you asked for on the new year but youd have to be quiet then and live under those rules and i can tell you what would happen you would stay up all night long on new years night thinking what did we forget how did he cheat us we really forgot to leave this in we need to change the rules and were going to want more and more and more because first of all you dont want to admit to the american people what you really want to do youre anticapitalists youre antiamerican liberty youre antifree enterprise there are a number of the pillars of american exceptionalism that you just plain oppose and here we are hardworking american people why do we have all this capital it never was a zero sum game it never was if you look back where was it when the lets say the caveman first went out there and brought a pelt back and turned it into a blanket there was a little bit of wealth that was created out of the labor thats there when they were scavengers and foragers they still made tools and along the way somebody else could make a tool a little better a little more efficient and someone else could raise a little garden and trade some vegetables for some arrowheads whatever it might be someone else could tan a hide better than the person that hunted for the pelt and so they traded labor and in the middle of all of that they acquired things they said ill tell you what lets do two pelts you keep one ill keep the other fine now theres two blankets where there had only been one before and on and on they went building and building and building capital because we had free enterprise capitalism we let people invest their sweat and they turned it into equity and eventually they invented the wheel and along came the industrial revolution where we built things and we put them on ships and we traded around the world and we found that there were resources that were developed in other countries more efficiently than we could here adam smith wrote in wealth of nations about how they had the wool industry going on up in england and scotland and in ireland and so they should be the ones there that were shearing sheep and turning that into clothing and put the wool products that they did so well on ships and sail them down to portugal where they were a lot better at raising grapes and turning that into wine and bring back a load of wine and a ship full of wool and that was the division of labor that he described and both countries were better off whenever there are two people that trade a dollar and its a business transaction or its two or more maybe its three four five or six people in this exchange these business deals are set up because each party benefits there doesnt need to be a loser in an economic transaction and when i hire somebody to go to work for me and i pay them a wage they get something in return they want the money they want the benefits they might want the challenge i hope they do and they want to contribute and we reach this agreement it is a contractual agreement between two consenting adults and so capital is built wealth is built its not a zero sum game gold got mined out by the incas and the aztecs and adam smith wrote about that and he said the spanish galleons went back across the ocean with having cut out the cost of laborhe didnt say by stealing the gold from the incas and the aztecs he said they cut out the cost of labor and once they removed a significant cost of the labor of producing the gold from them they dumped it into the markets in europe and the price of gold went down well supply and demand the cost of the capital and cost of the labor goes together to produce any product that we have there and over the centuries we built ships and we built buildings and we built highways we built bridges and we created cash and currency to trade our labor back and forth with a commodity that would be willing to exchange thats money and then the capital thats built in this world now is trillions and trillions and yes class envy sets in and people think they get a case of the poor mes if government doesnt go hand them a job and i hear some of you that say well the people that want to work should work people who want to work should have a job i would argue that the people that are able to that the people that are able to work need to sustain themselves and they need to contribute to the gross domestic product in this country it is the patriotic thing to do america has created now this culture within us that somehow the federal government is going to guarantee a middle class standard of living to everybody that lives in this country legal and illegal i know youre going to be astonished at this but there are 72 different meanstested federal welfare programs functioning in the united states today 72 of them there isnt a single american that can name them from memory if they cant name them from memory neither can they describe them and if they cant describe them neither can they understand how they function individually let alone understand how 72 different welfare programs can interact with each other and function to provide an incentive for people to do the right thing which is produce for themselves maybe get an education develop some job skills go get a job william bennett told us when i came to this congress that he said he could solve 75 percent of the nations pathologies get married stay married get a job keep a job thats 75 percent you know if hes right on that id say the other percent is substance abuse ill bet we could get to about 99 percent if people would get married stay married get a job keep a job and not abuse alcohol and reject illegal drugs youd solve a lot of the domestic squabbles that go on and this society would go on we need to be a moral society but we are a nation of doers and achievers and our culture is being eroded by those who want to expand the dependency class in america and thats you folks over on that side of the aisle youre in the business of expanding the dependency class in america it goes on over and over and over again and you do that because some of you believe maybe even all of you believe that it is somehow a humane thing to do to take from the sweat of one persons brow and hand it over to someone who wont sweat for their own but you do it because it expands your political base and then you pander to and cater to the people that youre promising somebody elses labor to and you think that americas going to be stronger no were getting weaker weve reached the point now where these 300 million americans that we have when you add upwe talk about how many on unemployment do we have oh it was 15 million now its 14 million you look at the weekly numbers of the new signups and that number ranges down there under 400 000 or so and we think oh it was a good week we had less than 400 000 new signups to unemployment and people run off the other end and they expire and theyre no longer eligible and so that number went from around 15 million unemployed down to around 14 million unemployed or a little more thats not the number that we should be most concerned about it is a number we should add the 14 million that meet the definition for unemployment to the number of americans that are of working age that are simply not in the work force the department of labor has that on their web site anyone can go there i think its dol gov something like that and on that web site youll see different age groups of those working age it starts at age 16 16 to 19 there are around 9 million americans of that working age that are simply not in the workforce yes they may be in school a lot of us worked our way through school and i started before that age of and then you go from 20 on up to 25 or so theres another chunk work your way on up americans of working age not in the workforce when i came to this congress not that long ago were 69 million then it became 80 million and about 21 2 months ago the number for the first time in the history of this country the number of americans of working age not in the workforce now has exceeded 100 million americans100 million think what you could do with the labor of 100 million americans and while thats going on now we have what is our number 11 12 or more million illegals in america i actually think its 20 million or more but they keep tamping that number down they keep coming across the border and the number got lower instead of greater by some analysis but in any case we know this about seven out of every 12 illegals here in this country work thats marginally a little greater than the number of americans that are working and that seven out of 12 that are there are part of around 8 million 7 million to 8 million documented ill say studyanalyzed consensus numbers 7 to 8 million illegals in america that were working now if they all woke up tomorrow in their home country that conceivably creates 8 million new jobs well you know if they werent coming into this country illegally you wouldnt need so many people to go guard the border either and they could do something productive rather than something thats not contributing economically to this country in the fashion that produces goods and services so theres 8 million jobs there but there are many other jobs out there for the people that will go out there and start a business go ask for a job compete in this marketplace and every one of the 100 million americans who are not working that puts in 1 hours work even a week contributes to the gross domestic product of the united states of america people who are not working not producing are not contributing unless of course theyve got investments that are returning and then ill give them some credit for that but 100 million think if you were on a boat or a ship and lets say you had 300 people on that boat or ship and you had to have some trimming the sails some pulling the oars some swabbing the decks some down in the galley some cooking cleaning housekeeping and somebody up there taking care of the captain and what if you had 100 out of those 300 people that said im going to sit here in steerage bring me my food clean up my mess thats the scope of what america is faced with today id put the people on the oars id put them up there trimming the sails and swabbing the decks and we will sail a lot smoother well be a lot stronger country and well feel better about ourselves this dignity of work is there for every man and woman that takes that job on and i challenge us all lets step up take the freedom we have left lets grasp for more of that liberty lets grasp more of that freedom and lets put some of these 100 million people to work so they can contribute to their gross domestic product the rest of the world will respect us more well be stronger economically well have more prudent people that are contributing to the ideas in this congress and we will get to a balanced budget and we will start to pay down this national debt and we will enforce and respect the rule of law i would go on for another half hour articulating some of the other pillars of american exceptionalism but i recognize there is a limit to not your patience but my time i appreciate your attention and i would yield back the balance of my time"], [0.006208539009094238, 0.5062085390090942, 0, "i agree with

review act an act passed by a republican congress and president clinton that gives the congress the opportunity to look at the regulatory burdens imposed by the executive branch and in a simple upordown vote say do we want this regulation on the books or do we not today that regulation is the net neutrality regulation the fcc has promulgated h j res 37 the underlying bill that this rule allows us to consider disapproves of the december 21 fcc rule concerning net neutrality on the basis that congress did not authorize the fcc to regulate in this area according to a d c circuit court decision in april of last year the fcc failed to demonstrate that it had the authority to regulate internet network management until such time as the fcc is given that authority by this congress we must reject any rules that it promulgates in this area now we will hear a lot today in the underlying resolution about the effective compromise that was crafted by the fcc we will hear a lot about the light touch that was used by the fcc to wade into this area but if you dont have the authority to do it you dont have the authority to do it it is congress responsibility to delegate that authority if folks like the underlying rule proposed by the fcc they are welcome to bring that back as a congressional resolution this bill today is about congressional prerogative will we or will we not stand up to an executive branch that does not have the authority to regulate we have done a sad job in this congress in years past of providing that oversight responsibility republicans had the responsibility of providing oversight to the bush administration and we didnt always live up to that measure democrats had the responsibility to provide oversight to the obama administration and they havent always lived up to that example we have the opportunity today to begin that step forward until congress acts to delegate that responsibility the internet should continue as the internet has grown and always continued as an area free of government interference as an opportunity for entrepreneurs and investors and students and the elderly to be out there using the internet as they see fit free from the hand of government regulation i would also like to comment briefly on the nature of this rule it is a closed rule i came to this congress to advocate in favor of an open process but it needs to be understood that the congressional review act is a closed process by nature what my constituents said to me is rob if you are doing something complicated i want you to open up the house floor and have as many amendments and as much discussion as you can because that is the right way to do things but what i would really prefer is you bring one bill with one idea and have an upordown vote for all the world to see well that is exactly the call that we have responded to today a simple bill one page long that says the fcc does not have the delegated congressional authority to act in this area and as such their regulations shall be null and void with that i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
