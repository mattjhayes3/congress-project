gentleman from pennsylvania was the driving force behindfthe national literacy act and he changed the way children learn to read with the enactment of the reading excellence act ej 2200 once again the gentleman from pennsylvania is leading the charge to create a more literate society with the reauthorization of the even start family illiteracy program a bill he helped offer nearly 12 years ago like the gentleman from pennsylvania i believe that the literacy skills of americas adults are simply not adequate to encourage individual opportunity increase worker productivity or strengthen our countrys competitiveness around the world according to the national center for educational statistics approximately 21 percent of the adult population more than 40 million americans over the age of 16 has only rudimentary reading and writing skills an additional 8 million adults were unable to perform the most basic literacy test and a smaller percentage had such limited skills that they were unable to even respond to the survey sadly studies show that illiteracy is an intergenerational problem one that follows a parentchild pattern students who have not been exposed to reading before they enter school are at a significant disadvantage when compared with students whose parents read to them in addition students with illiterate parents are more likely to perform poorly in school and they are more likely to drop out before graduation the bill before us today the literacy involves family together act seeks to remedy these problems by improving the quality of services provided under the even start family literacy program specifically lift would require even start programs to base reading instruction on scientifically based research as part of the nationalreading panel the national institute for child health and human development has conducted extensive research on the best way to teach children to read and i believe it is of utmost importance for our literacy centers to make use of this data lift would also fund a research project to find the most effective way to improve literacy among parents and reading difficulties and to help parents use their new skills to support their childrens redevelopment finally the lift act raises the quality of family literacy programs to allow states to use a portion of their even start dollars to provide expert training and technical assistance to even start providers and family literacy instructors we live in a nation where both the volume and variety of written information are growing and where increasing numbers of citizens are expected to be able to read understand and use these materials i commend the gentleman from pennsylvania chairman goodling for his leadership and wish him a long and enjoyable retirement"],

want to thank the gentlewoman from texas for her leadership and efforts to wipe out the marriage tax penalty she has made a very important point that those who really suffer the most from the marriage tax penalty tend to be working women traditionally and it is changing but traditionally the second earner has been a women now it has changed where more women are becoming the primary bread winner but traditionally that has not been the case right now if a woman is in the work force that causes a marriage tax penalty it is just not right that she is punished as well as her husband if she goes into the work force because they want a little extra money to make ends meet and care for their children so clearly as we work to eliminate the marriage tax penalty there is a lot of people who benefit 25 million married working couples who benefit from our efforts to wipe out the marriage tax penalty as the gentlewoman from texas also pointed out the primary beneficiary of the legislation that we are going to vote on tomorrow are those with incomes between 30 000 and 75 000 in combined income joint income between husband and wife who suffer the marriage tax penalty with the legislation we are going to pass out of the house tomorrow hopefully with an overwhelming bipartisan support and i would note that there are 30 democrats that are cosponsoring along with a total of 241 bipartisan cosponsors almost every republican is a cosponsor of this bill that we wipe out the marriage tax penalty but also for a couple making 30 000 a year we essentially wipe out their tax burden entirely in fact according to the joint committee on taxation a bipartisan tax advisory panel that gives tax advice when it comes to tax issues to the house committee on ways and means as well as other members of the house and senate if a married couple has a combined income of 30 000 which is a pretty moderate income they would see almost 94 percent of their tax burden wiped away as a result of this legislation if a couple has a combined income of 75 000 between husband and wife they would see about a 10 to 11 percent reduction in their tax burden as a result of wiping out the marriage tax penalty that is real money when we think about it the average marriage tax penalty is 1 400 it is just not right that marriage couples pay an average 1 400 more because they are married compared to an identical couple with identical couple who are not married and may live together back in the south suburbs of chicago and the area i represent there are 1 1 million illinois married couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty fourteen hundred dollars is 1 years tuition for a nursing student at joliet junior college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for a family with children

to strengthen social security by locking away 100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty

accounts for about 4 to 8 percent of the budgets of the average school district and i wanted to know if they thought that was helping the answer i got back was yes the money helps but there is too much red tape and there is too much regulation they want greater freedom so that they can exercise their skills and use the teachers and principals and parents and everybody involved in education on

important thing about education flexibility is that it combines flexibility with accountability which is the way it ought to be done you can get the waiver the local school districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that we go further than the education flexibility act right now there is far too much red tape and far too many regulations in hundreds of different areas generated from the federal government that does not really help our local schools but only ties them in knots i do not want the people working in the schools in my community to spend all of their time filling out forms and justifying their existence to the federal government i want them to be educating the children there and doing the job that really matters right now far too often they are filling out the forms and trying to qualify for the money and continually justifying what they axe doing we need to change that we need to shift to local control from one end of this country to the other exciting things are going on in states and school districts they are making the reforms necessary they are moving towards accountability and right now the federal government is too big of a noose stopping them from making progress on that we need to make changes like the education flexibility act as a democrat i have always been a strong supporter of education and i support my fellow democrats in supporting spending the money necessary to help with education and supporting public education public education is responsible for over 90 percent of the children in this country getting educated it needs our support but we cannot simply spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best how to do it we need to make those changes so that we can have the world class public education system we need the education flexibility act that we introduce this week as i mentioned primarily sponsored by the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from

years become a source in fact it is now producing the statistics we heard when we visited these areas last week it is now producing more coca and more cocaine than any other region in the world colombia now why did colombia suddenly become a source of narcotics what is interesting again if we look at the history of what took place this administration has blocked consistently any assistance to colombia to eradicate drugs at their source to go after drug traffickers and to stop the production of drugs so what has happened is they are now becoming producers the gentleman from indiana myself the gentleman from illinois the previous chair of this responsibility when the republicans took over the congress we went down to colombia some 4 years ago four years ago there was almost no heroin being produced in colombia they told us then unless the administration freed up the constraints on sending ammunition helicopters eradication resources into that country there would be a flood of poppies and heroin produced guess what that is exactly what has happened an incredible amount of heroin is now being produced and it is now flowing from colombia look at this chart into miami some came through puerto rico because the administration cut the coast guards budget the coast guard protects the air around puerto rico they cut that in half so it came into puerto rico it came into miami and came into central florida and also is coming in through a weak link in the chain which is mexico this is the new pattern that we see mexico has approximately 60 to 70 percent of the hard narcotics coming into the united states coming in through mexico transiting through mexico now we have a new development in addition to a failed policy in colombia which this administration over the objections of congress the new majority in congress we repeatedly sent letters requests we passed resolutions we did everything we could to get them to give general serrano the head of the national colombian police and others the resources and ammunition eradication equipment to do away with drugs at their source costeffective when they get into our streets into our schools and law enforcement in this

after the vote this was not a vote against the troops this was a vote against the policy of this administration all of us support the troops and the young men and women who are doing their duty but i think it is also sad i understand that people become so emotionally charged that if they lose they automatically say this was a partisan vote and i understand that but i think it is important to remember that these are very serious issues and all of us have very strong feelings about them and we may not all agree with the views of others but i think as we debate unitedstates involvement in kosovo it is important to remember that there has been political and religious turmoil in kosovo since at least 1389 the muslim forces of the ottoman empire defeated serb forces on the plains of kosovo at a place called the field of black birds and kosovo has been a sacred place for muslims and orthodox serbs for generations it is unimaginable really that either group would ever be forced to leave a place they consider their homeland now today in the new york times and other national magazines our military commanders of nato acknowledged that 5 weeks of intensive bombing has failed to reduce the size of the serbian forces in kosovo or in their operations against albanians the 4 423 bombing sorties may have rendered serb air defenses ineffective but air strikes have not accomplished the stated purpose to stop the ethnic cleansing of the kosovars however innocent civilians in belgrade in kosovo and other locations throughout serbia and yugoslavia have been killed by nato air strikes and the number of civilian casualties and incidents of misdirected weapons continues to increase relentless bombing has become ineffective and the more it continues the more innocent civilians are going to be killed and injured in kosovo and in serbia and certainly a military action in which the only victims are civilians will not be long supported by the world community now i do not think we should mislead the american people we already are in a quagmire in yugoslavia and there is no easy way out and it is very complex but in my view and the reason that i have voted against the resolution this evening because we have all sat by and we have watched these relentless air strikes that are totally destroying the infrastructure of yugoslavia and in the near future they are going to be coming back to america to help rebuild the country but the reason i voted against the resolution tonight giving the president authority to continue these air strikes is because i believe that at this point america only has two options one is an allout ground war with air support to recapture kosovo now this option would require over 75 000 ground troops casualties would be inevitable and troop presence would be essential to protect kosovars for a long time once the war was completed the other option is a diplomatic solution the goal of nato should be to return the kosovars to kosovo a military presence will be required to assure their safety and of course serbian forces must be removed now there have been some indications recently that mr milosevic may accept and be willing and required to accept the presence of foreign troops in kosovo in fact he alluded to that in a recent interview with cspan so i think that we have a real opportunity here through the russians through our nato allies through others that have contacts with mr milosevic to push this opportunity i hope the president and his advisers will pursue a diplomatic solution as soon as possible to end this

that came out of the committee on ways and means we ought to respond to the basic needs of people who want to work when their jobs disappear if advocates for pntr truly believe that americas workers will only benefit from pntr for china then they have nothing to fear from this amendment we should have a vote on this amendment however it is my understanding that this amendment may be struck by a point of order and therefore i want to ask my colleagues to join me in establishing a formal china taa assistance program in a bill that i will drop into the hopper right after this debate today and i urge members to join me along with a growing list of original cosponsors in making a stand for the workers of this country by cosponsoring this important bill and supporting this amendment i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new jersey who has been such a strong voice for working americans from coast to coast"]]}
