will make on the matter of the budget resolution for fiscal year 1982 will be the most important decisions of the 97th congress the type of budget resolution which will soon be adopted by this body will in a large measure determine the future course of this nation this administration contends that the american people on november 4 1980 gave ronald reagan a mandate to reduce federal spending cut taxes and slow inflation op february 18 1981 the president reacted to this socalled mandate by producing perhaps the most revolutionary budget document which this nation has ever seen the budget revealed by the presidentnow embodied in the grammlatta substituteprovides millions more for the most prosperous in our nation while pennies are taken away from the poor in the name of 1econamic recovery the budget revealed by the president would pad the pentagon with over 50 billion in new money for ships and other weapons for which we lack the skilled manpower to build and operate in the name of national security the administration budget would take away a 46cent meal from a food stamp recipient household or a ceta job from a high school dropout in the name of reducing inflation it is hard for me to understand the nature of a mandate in which a cold and callous insensitivity for the poor the disadvantaged the handicapped the elderly and the unemployed in our society is disguised as maintaining a social safety net for the truly needy to this date no one in this administration has yet defined this illusory term truly needy i do not believe that the american people mandaited the dismantlement of government by thiq means indeed ihe cbc has met the president headon by accepting his challenge to propose measures which offer a greater chance of balancing the budget reducing and eliminating inflation stimulating the creation of jobs and reducing the tax burden most importantly the cbc substitute accomplishes the economic goals which president reagan purports to address except that we do it with humaneness and compassion our substitute offers a greater chance for addressing the economic ills of this nation time and time again we have heard administration officials members of congress and bureaucrats recite how federal deficit spending causes inflation yet the administration budget or grammlatta substitute provides for a huge 50 billion deficit while the congressional black caucus does not subscribe to the tenet that a deficit creates inflation the cbc substitute amendment provides for a 7 85 billion surplus in fiscal year 1982 in a fiscally sound manner the cbc substitute offers the taxpayers a greater chance by rejecting the reagan administration tax cuts under the reagan plan 19 percent of the taxpayers with iincomes of 30 000 and above receive 61 percent of the tax relief while the 63 percent of the taxpayers with incomes below 20 000 receive only 18 percent of the tax relief the cbc rejects this economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich our substitute takes bold new steps toward innovative and comprehensive tax reforms our substitute offers the largest and fairest tax cut for the working poor and the middle class by increasing the standard deductiontaken by 60 percent of american taxpayersby indexing the tax code to control bracket creep and by increasing the earned income tax credit our substitute provides for a different approach to business incentives to stimulate capital formation and productivity by adopting a firstyear capital cost recovery system for business which has been endorsed by fortune magazine the new york times and the public interest tax research group our substitute generates ovvr 44 billion in additional revenue by ending wasteful and unproductive tax subsidies andl loopholes which only add to the federal deficit the cbc substitute offers the nation a greater chance by reflecting compassion and concern for our most precious resourcethe american people somewhere in the budget slashing hysteria we have forgotten that the people are the most important resource that we have we have forgotten that our government is here to serve the peopleall the people in this nation somewhere along the line we have gotten lost in a maze of cold statistics and numbers and percentagesforgetting about the human experience that lies beyond those numbers you forget that we live in a nation where government supposedly exists of the people by the people for the people i hope that before the final vote on this budget resolution that you will take the opportunity to walk the streets and see the multitude of our young people who are out of work contrary to some myths this is not because they do not want to work but rather because they lack the training and the opportunities to gain meaningful employment the caucus substitute may mean the difference between thousands of young people wasting their lives away or a cadre of young people who will have the basic skills to obtain productive employment i hope that befljre the final vote on this budget resolption that you will go grocery shoppipig with a welfare mother on food stamps you might get a vivid picture of how difficult it is for the 22 million americans on food stamps to purchase nutrtional food for a family on a limited budget the grammlatta substitute would take away nickels and dimes from food stamp benefits when pennies may make the difference for a poor food stamp recipient under our substitute a welfare mother on food stamps will not have to choose between eggs or milk or between bread or butter as members of congress you and i know that we get free medical care right here in this capital or in bethesda naval hospital other americans are not privileged to the best doctors for free it is in recognition of this type of reality that the cec substitute provides a full 75 1 billion for health care spending let me elaborate in this area a bit currently over 28 million elderly persons receive health care under medicare the elderly are sick more frequently and for more prolonged periods of time than the rest of the population of every 100 persons age 65 and over 80 suffer some kind of chronic ailment 10 suffer from impaired vision and 17 have hearing impairment sixteen of every one hundred persons age 65 and older are hospitalized one or more times annually the elderly require three times as many days of hospital care every year as persons under the age of 65 for most of our senior citizens illness strikes most often and with greatest severity at the time in life when incomes are most limited millions of our older citizens cannot afford the health care that they need it is a sad commentary on our society when many of our aged are forced to choose between seeing a doctor or getting a prescription filled or whether they will spend the money for food or warmth the cbc substitute protects funding for medicare since the enactment of medicaid in 1965 life expectancy of all races and sexes has increased and infant mortality rates have decreased clearly the medicaid program has helped nevertheless 23 million black americans still endure poorer health care higher death rates lower life expectancy and a reduced sense of wellbeing than the white population the shocking fact is that only half of the poor people in this country are eligible for medicaid benefits thirteen million children are supposed to receive physical checkups medical and dental care under medicaid yet 1 out of 3 american children has never seen a dentist one in seven has no access to regular health care the caucus substitute protects medicaid benefits for the poor andsick in our society under the grammlatta substitute which incorporates a cap on medicaid spending many states if not most would have to slash medicaid eligibility and benefits in fact many states are already doing so our nation leads the world in terms of biomedical research in fiscal year 1981 we will spend over 3 billion for this purpose yet we still do not have adequate treatment for cancer we have not found a way to cure diabetes we do not know how to prevent a myriad of diseases which cripple and debilitiate our people our substitute protects funding for these important research activities millions of americans suffer from the wrenching problems of mental illness alcohol and drug abuse a presidential commission on mental health acknowledged and lamented the fact that we have neither adequate services or trained manpower to properly treat these problems our substitute aussumes that we at least maintain current levels of spending for mcntal health services research and training minorities are severely underrepresented in the health professions for example blacks comprise fewer than 3 percent of lhe nations physicians and dentists and pharmacists less than 4 percent of podiatrists less than 1 percent of veterinarians and optometrists the cbc substitute provides funding for the federal programs which were designed to address thes~e fundamental inequities let me say that the bottom line is that the ci3c substitute meets the human capital needs of this nationin health education employment income security science and technologybetter than any other proposal before you the caucus substitute offers proof that the budget can be balanced goveminent

deterioration in the farm export outlook the burden of record agricultural surpluses has been compounded by this reduction in the value of unitedstates farm exportsthe first such reduction since 1969 in addition certain commodities are experiencing a reduction in export volume as well as value corn export shipments for example are at a 5year low the dismal prospects for resumed strong growth in unitedstates export markets point to the need for developing additional domestic outlets for our grain production the development of an established alcohol fuels industry offers the potential for creating substantial new domestic demand for grain a goal which if realized could lead to strong and stable prices for american producers a mature alcohol fuels industry could also serve as a model for current efforts to promote the value added production and export for unitedstates goods for example those alcohol producers using the wet milling process can obtain from one 56pound bushel of corn 2 5 gallons of anhydrous ethanol 1 7 pounds of corn oil 3 pounds of corn gluten meal a 60percent protein product 14 5 pounds of corn gluten feed a 21percent protein additive and 15 pounds of highgrade

alcohol fuels based on mid1981 corn prices unitedstates onp would increase by 1 89 for each bushel of corn diverted from the export market to produce ethanol similar studies have projected the

country really needs is a marshall plan yes a marshall plan to rebuild american industry but that would take a lot of time and a lot of money there is an old saying given enough time and money you can solve any problem that may be true but we do not have either meanwhile american industry is growing old our industrial base is literally antiquated obsolete and in many cases bankrupt hurt the mostare small and mediumsized businesses those companies that provide most of the jobs in americathe very same companies which form the hard core or heart of if you willsomething we call the unitedstates defense industrial base our machine tools for example are typically 25 to 27 years old how can we expect to compete with the west germans whose machine tools average 15 years in age and probably more importantly with the japanese whose machine tools are only 10 years or less even in our highgrowth hightechnology industries we are being vigorously challenged the result of this is a higher cost for the myriad of items from very sophisticated components right down to the simple nuts and bolts sole sources are becoming distressingly commonplace many items are simply not being made in america any more the unitedstates dependency on foreign i r rces for fasteners castings forgings optical equipment and other basic parts is nothing less than shocking the situation i am describing has been documented in detail as part of 27 days of hearings involving more than 125 witnesses before the house subcommittee on economic stabilization i have the honor to be chairman of that subcommittee the situation also has been examined in many hearings before the house committee on armed services the joint economic committee and other congressional units the subcommittee on economic stabilization has a responsibilityindeed a dutyto do something to help remedy the problem that responsibility is vested in our exclusive legislative jurisdiction over the defense production act of 1950 therefore today i am introducing a series of major amendments to the defense production act to strengthen the domestic capability and capacity of the industrial base this is a totally bipartisan action joining me as the chief cosponsor is the gentleman from connecticut the legislation was jointly drafted by democratic and republican staff this is an allamerican problem needing an allamerican solution the bill entitled the defense industrial base revitalization act attacks the problem on three key fronts first the modernization of equipment and plant here we intend to help not the big corporations who serve as prime contractors instead the assistance under the bill would be targeted to highpriority subcontractors and suppliersbusinesses that do not have tax advantages or cannot use them these are mostly small and mediumsized businesses who run their financial affairs much in the same way most american families do that is they go out and borrow moneyfrom their neighborhood banker they depend on credit to purchase new equipment they compete for that credit with highly profitable service industries such as fastfood outlets and retailers selling blue jeans in many cases it is not a difficult choice for the banker to decide between financial statements showing a constant booming market and the small machine shop or foundry with lots of ups and downs and the lack of a clearly defined nearterm market this legislation will enable these businesses through financial incentives such as loan guarantees direct loans price guarantees and purchase agreements to get the capital they need clearly there is not enough money to help everybody therefore this would be in a sense a competition the administration is culrently developing a priority ranking of industries most important to defense including the most problem ridden in terms of capability and capacity the legislation requires a constant priority assessment of those industries which are necessary to the manufacture or supply of national defense materials required for national security or are likely to be required in time of emergency or war within those priority categories our legislation would mandate special preference to those companies that come up with plans showing unusual promise in boosting productivity improving quality developing new processes and reducing our reliance on foreign imports this would not be dependent on whether or not they are currently performing defense contracts the winners would be those companies willing to accept the full challenges and risks of industrial modernization a second major objective of this bill is to help provide the skilled labor and professionals to cope with existing and anticipated ynanpower shortages in our defense industrial base the legislation would direct the president to launch programs to fill these needs in high priority industries the defense department alroady has identified 73 of these critical skills in regard tc skilled labor we would propose a costsharing program with state vocational education boards wprking closely with industry labor and with educational institutions of the states the emphasis would be on training retraining and upgrading skills to operate new equipment and plant in highpriority industries of the defense industrial base in this program the idea would be to fill existing vacancies and to meet projected critical skill manpower needs this is not a social program we simply must provide the means to train people for the critical skills needed in any defense buildup for example the typical age of a skilled machinist today is 58 and in a few years more than half of these people will retire in many of our industrial centers today you will see columns of help wanted ads seeking highly skilled labor although there are plenty of people seeking jobs they do not have the necessary skills yet we have thousands of men and women currently out of work in depressed industries many of these people could be retrained or have their existing skills upgraded for job opportunities available right now and those that will be available in the near future on the professional side there are serious shortages of scientific and technical personnel in the fields of engineering computer sciences and many other disciplines our colleges and universities are hard pressed to retain younger faculty members to teach and they find it difficult to encourage students to continue their studies for higher degrees in light of high salaries from industry one of the major problems for our colleges and universities is the purchase of modern laboratory and other equipment to train these students and provide them with the means to do research much of the equipment is out of dateleterally 15 years or more behind the times in a number of cases so we are frequently producing professionals who are ill equipped to match the competition we are receiving from japan west germany and other industrialized nations this situation must be remedied what we propose to help this effort is a program of assistance in the form of matching grants for new and modern equipment in university schools of engineering and other scientific and technical disciplines needed for highpriority tasks in our defense industrial base the legislation introduced today has a third major objective it would direct the president to develop greater domestic capability and capacity to produce critical and strategic materials especially where unitedstates dependence i large and overseas sources are unstable or even unfriendly the proposed program also would emphasize recycling scrap improving extraction and processing and the development of substitutes and other advanced materials technologies the objective would be greater independence or insurance from possible cutoffs shortages and cartellike price increases these are all threats within the realm of real possibility experts in both the last and current administrations have emphasized the need to develop domestic sources for such key materials as cobalt titanium aluminum natural rubber and a number of other strategic and critical materials if you can believe it the soviet union is one of the primary sources for certain key minerals needed by the unitedstates defense effort especially military aircraft there is serious concern regarding this nations minerals import dependency our industrial health is dependent upon an uninterrupted supply of a variety of materials some of the most vital of these materials are imported in excess of 86 percent annually according to the bureau of mines data for 1980 for example we are 100 percent import dependent on our supply of columblum an essential element in superalloys used in jet and turbine engines in the case of bauxite and alumina the raw materials needed to make aluminum which is of particular importance to the transportation industry the unitedstates imports 94 percent of its needed supply we rely on imports for 97 percent of our manganese whose deoxidizing desulfurizing and conditioning properties are critical for the steel industry 93 percent of our cobalt which has several uses most attractive of which is cobalts ability to withstand high temperatures and 91 percent of our chromium which is used as an alloy to increase hardness and impact strength in steel as well as making steel more versatile the platinum group metals palladium rhodium fridium ruthenium and osmium and tantalum are also included in the list of critical materials upon which we are import dependent 87 percent and 97 percent respectively we need to develop more domestic sources and substitutes conserve more in their use recycle where possible and thus keep additional dollars at home while creating new jobs and saving energy m speaker we have a record defense budget this legislation allows us to spend those dollars more productively and efficiently by addressing the problems of our defense infrastructureaging tools and machinery and critidal manpower shortagesthe bill seeks to eliminate greater defense expenditures and waste a strong america must be prepared to respond to any challenges we have learned the hard way that a modern strong industrial production base is absolutely cascntial the only way we won world war ii was that america was able to produce weapons faster than the enemy could destroy them the lesson here is that weapons mean nothing unless you can manufacture their components spare parts and replace them this absolutely requires a vigorous industrial base with a good supply of the right materials and perhaps most important of al highly skilled men and women who can out produce any people in the world i know the sum and substance of what i have said here is a fact it is also an enormous challenge what is needed is action to meet tmat challengeaction now we believe the program we propose will not only strengthen our defense industrial base but all of unitedstates industry because they are virtually one and the same older industrial states which would have to make a major contribution to defenre preparedness could not only reinvest in unused industrial capacity but expand capability to diversify their economies let us put people back to workimproving their productivity making better quality products and regaining our competitive position in world trade in this case government can help to create a market the same industries mondernized under this legislation and the same workers trained for highly skilled jobs will produce not only needed defense items but also those for a vibrant peaceful economy the sectionbysection summary of the bill follows"], [0.4936578869819641, 0.5063421130180359, 1, "our consideration today of h r 6267 the net worth guarantee act is clear evidence that the house can move quickly on legislation when the situation warrants since the introduction of the chairmans original capital infusion bill in february the banking committee has moved steadily ahead examining the alternatives and devising a program designed to help the nations mortgage lenders survive current economic conditions few would doubt that such assistance is needed indeed a newsweek cover story last month so developed the publics awareness of the problems of the thrifts that congress was forced to reaffirm the safety and stability of the nations banking system these are times of great change within all sectors of our financial system and mortgage lenders would be challenged under the best of conditions prolonged high interest rates have helped to make the transition almost unbearably painful as institutions saddled with huge portfolios of low interest h 2453 mortgages struggle to compete for record cost deposits our committee heard testimony from the chairman of the federal home loan bank board which further quantified the extent of thrift probleins a negative 0 75 percent return on industry assets for 1981 losses of almost 5 billion over the year and net worth eroded by some 15 percent over the course of the yearthese statistics threaten the survival of many institutions survival is directly tied to interest rates rates which many expected to drop before now but which have shown enormous resistance to real improvements slight drops this spring were insignificant when corrected for inflation which virtually disappeared during the same period by the federal home loan bank boards own estimate some 400 institutions would exhaust their capital accounts this year if interest rates remain at current levels even with a drop of 200 basis points nearly half that number would not survive these are the grim statistics that motivate our action today for most institutions erosion of net worth have proved to be the most serious i fireat to survival cash flow is often adequate to keep them in business but when net worth falls below the guidelines established by banking regulators institutions are subject to intervention and often merger during 1981 the pace of mergers was furious unprecedented in industry history the publics confidence in the survival of the industry was eroded right along with net worth and that coupled with aggressive competition from nonbanking institutions like money market funds precipitated a dangerous decline in the share of net savings deposits flowing into thrifts twentythree of the 1981 thrift mergers arranged by the fslic required some form of financial assistance from the deposit insurance fund additional mergers of savings banks drew on the more substantial assets of the fdic the high costs of some mergers coupled with the growing potential for more largescale assisted mergers helped the regulators to recognize the limitations of the merger solution although the risk to the insurance fund depends on future interest rates and thus is impossible to predict accurately it became clear that some form of assistance would be necessary for the survival of both the industry and the insurance system during committee consideration of this legislation i ade 4 that we hold any proposal to certain minimum criteria in order that we accomplish our goal as efficiently as possible i believe that most other members of the committee shared my concern that the program we des gn be of longterm benefit to both the industry and to the nations consumers certainly i am convinced of the public benefits of the survival of the nations savings and loans but it is equally important to secure that survival as efficiently as possible first we need to protect against subsidizing those institutions which have no chance of survival there is no direct cost to the guarantees until an institution should fail whereupon the full value of the guarantees must be paid it makes sense to minimize the risk of such failures by permitting the regulators to withhold assistance from doomed institutions i am pleased that h r 6267 provides the necessary authority second we should deny federal assistance to those institutions whose troubles are the result of poor management and bad investment decisions it is not our intent to shelter the unwise from the consequences of their own mistakes we aim only to sustain those who are threatened by murderous interest rates the bill we have before us mandates that the regulators shall ascertain that the losses of any participating institution are not due to mismanagement they will also disqualify those who may attempt to manipulate net worth in order to qualify for the program these are important safeguards which i endorse from the beginning there was also a strong consensus among committee members that assistance should be limited to institutions with significant mortgage portfolios and that assistance should be tied to continuing that mortgage lending commitment in the first draft the bill specified a low rate of interest for new mortgage commitments as attractive as such rates would be to consumers i opposed requiring such lowinterest rates on the grounds that they would only perpetuate the current mismatch between assets and liabilities of thrifts i am pleased that the current version of the bill contains the mortgage lending requirement without specifying an interest rate one amendment accepted by the committee during markup was of special interest to those of us to represent states with franchise taxes such taxes are not based on profits and thus failing institutions are equally liable yet the committee was reluctant to permit federal assistance payments to flow through the institutions into state coffers the original version of the bill simply exempted institutions from such state taxes although i am opposed on principal to franchise taxes i am equally opposed to federal overrides of state taxing prerogatives and thus i was pleased to support a compromise amendment which simply provides for a delay in payment of state franchise taxes during participation in this program it is important to remember that the net worth guarantee program will not solve the basic problems which brought savings and loans so much trouble they will remain saddled with lowyield mortgages for many years and despite the fact that their investments in such mortgages were mandated by federal regulation this program does not address this problem i have introduced a mortgage warehousing program which would relieve mortgage lenders of the worst of this burden but my bill seems to have fallen victim to the budget ax the more fundamental problem which unless solved will remain a wolf at the door of these institutions is the level of interest rates we are really buying a temporary reprieve in hopes that future interest rates will provide a permanent solution to these problems it is clear that mortgage lenders will have an important role to play in the future if those interest rates return to tolerable levels but it is more difficult to predict when that might be in the meantime i com mend this legislation to my colleagues"], [0.49377596378326416, 0.5062240362167358, 1, "i submitted the udallobeyreuss substitute tax package to the house of representatives last week and because of the very hectic nature of that day did not have time to insert all of my remarks into the record while my plan was defeated there continues to be interest in the package that mr obey and mr reuss and i put together in light of the outcome on the taxcut vote i wanted to insert this edited version of my remarks today some 144 members of the house voted for the tudallobeyreuss plan i want to take this opportunity to share this full record of my comments with my colleagues as well as with my constituents in southern arizona let me take you back 4 years because i want to make two points first in march of 1977 we had a new president in town we all said give the new guy a chance and he went on television to tell us he had a comprehensive energy program to deal with the countrys priority problem hie sent the plan to the congress and said could we please vote yes or no up or down as soon as possible surely in the next few months and send it back to the white house by the august recess but there was no billnot in august 1977 not even in august 1978 the bill that was finally approved in october 1978 was pretty badly mangled at that now let us move to 1981 we have another new president in town and most americans have been saying let us give him a chance by april he comes before the congress to tell us that our economy and our energy policy are both in a mess and heres his huge and difficult and complicated program to clean it up could we please act quickly and give the president and the country some answers preferably before the august recess well we have heard about our democratic leadership stalling or falling to move quickly it is a bum rap we have worked hard and we have dealtwith budget cuts of historic size now we have given a president a program based on dangerous farreaching unprecedented economic assumptions not in 18 months as was our response to president carter but in 16 weeks i have watched with increasing dismay these last few weeks as the leadership on the republican side rallied around the president almost unanimously without asking the kind of tough questions about his policy that were askedno demandedof president carters and some of my democratic friends many of them played a new round of a tired old game called my tax cut is bigger than your tax cut any number can play but this year the stakes were extraordinarily high and our countrys whole economic foundation is at stake again let me return to 1977 because there is another parallel there to what we face in 1981 back in 1977 when jimmy carter and his new team came to town they told us that they had promised during the campaign to balance the federal budget and that this pledge would be kept but they had just looked at the new numbers and they said well hold on we simply can not do it after all in 1977 or 1978 and actually 1979 did not look promising but they would guarantee that by 1980a new election yeara balanced budget would be a reality as it worked out we had a 60 billion deficit now here we are in 1981 the president and his team with david stockman in charge tell us that they promised to balance the budget and its a pledge that will be kept but they just looked at the new figures and they can not do it in 1981 or 1982 anid 1983 does niot look all that great but you can be sure that it will be balanced by 1984which happens to be a new election year now they have even backed away from that saying 1984 does not look so hot either maybe 1985 we can not wait that long i sense a real and dangerous skepticism in america today people really question whether the congress is doing anything or can do anything about the economic mess we are in or whether we are going to be serious about helping turn this country around i believe that noth~ing would do more to return confidence to our people and our financial and investment institutions than a balanced budget now i am not alone in that belief the noted wall street economist henry kaufman has declared to fight inflation head on the ne ed is for the government to achieve a balanced budget in fiscal 1982 this would chop inflationary expectations and of equal importance would reduce the role of the government as a powerful demander of credit thereby freeing savings to finance the private sector our substitute was the only bill in the house or senate which could have achieved that goal of a balanced budget and it would have done it without mirrors or rash assumptions and it did not touch the national defense approprations we have already approved our bill did not try to outpromise the gop we were not competing to see who could give the mnost to th oil companies or to investors who straddle the commodities market we did not seek to engage in a bidding war what our bill sought to do was this first to bring interest rates down and to begin the process now this year the reagan administration is budgeting 106 billion for interest on the national debtthe third highest item in the budget the 1982 budget depending on whose figures you use will have a deficit in the 50 billion to 60 billion range we need to take government out of the business of outbidding businesses and individuals in the financial markets in this way we can free the capital that our country so desperately needs for productive enterprises our measure sought to drastically reducc outlays for interest on the national debt mr kaufman agrees here as well in business week of july 13 1981 he said if the reagan tax cut is in place by october 1 we face a new significant increase in interest rates second our proposal sought to raise 6 billion through tax reforms including the elimination of the oil depletion allowance and of commodity tax straddles the revenue loss would have amounted to 13 billion in fiscal 1982 but the estimated budget surplus for the year would have been 2 billion and 20 billion by fiscal 1983 third the same tax reforms would have provided the money to give americans an honest tax break phased in during 1982 it would not have been a tax break financed with borrowed money which was part of the administrative plan that the house approved under the plan that is becoming law taxpayers making 15 000 a year or less or 41 percent of the total tax filers will get 8 5 percent of the 1982 tax cut but people making 50 000 or more a year or 5 6 percent of the population will get 35 1 percent of the 1982 tax cut who are we helping let me digress for a moment and relate to you an imaginary conversation between dave stockman and a taxpayer it reinforces some points ive tried to make dave stockman walks out of the white house and bumps into a man on the street who makes 15 000 a year is married and has two children the man introduces himself and recognizes stockman how are things going asks the man not bad replies stockmnan i have good news for you what a tax cut stockman answers terrific says the man how much will a guy in my bracket get youll get about 150 says stockman yeah answers the man well thatll get me through a 40 pair of jordache jeans for my teenage daughter a 15 pair of tennis shoes for my boy maybe a 30 night out for my wife and i i can buy two tanks of gas for 30 and have 35 left over for the supermarket not terrific but better than nothing frankly mr stockman the thing that really pleases me is that you guys apparently have balanced the budget after all these years and youve got money left over to cut our taxes well i have to be honest says stockman we havent balanced the budget instead the deficit has gone up from 40 billion to around 60 billion and if our program works the way this mr laffer out in california says and if our best case assumptitons carry we are going to have another 128 billion in deficits before 1984 hey really says the man then where will we get the money for me and other americans to have a tax cut stockman says well borrow it when i was a congressman i used to call that printing money or monetizing the debt but isnt interest a big item in the federal budget this year asks the taxpayer i heard its something like 80 billion well yes thats right and well have to have some more interest payments even larger ones next year if we have that additional 60 billion deficit i mentioned in fact weve already budgeted 106 billion just to pay interest next year wont all of that cut down the money supply that we need for capital investment in homes and buildings and all the rest said the man i suppose says stockman but dr laffer and jack kemp say weve got to try this for 3 years first ive got to leave mr stockman says the taxpayer but it seems to me wed be a lot better off if we passed up a tax cut this year and got inflation under control and interest rates lowered and moved quickly toward a balanced budgetand then talk about tax cuts end of story except that i want to add that a cbsnew york times poll of february supported by other polls in more recent weeks showed that by a margin of 7~0 to 23 percent people would rather have a balanced budget before a tax cut if we are going to go into debt and drive up the cost of interest on the national debt by having tax cuts at least we ought to put that money almost all of it we allocated into getting productive assets built and installed and giving people jobs and creating long term economic activity instead what we have adopted as public policy on which all our hopes rest is that not only is there a free lunch but we will give you a bonus for eating it it is a little like going to see a doctor dr reagan says we have diagnosed your condition and run all the tests we find that you have a strange combination of symptoms some of our tests show that you suffer from serious highblood pressure and other tests show that you suffer from serious lowblood pressure what we are going to do is give you two kinds of medicine a pill for lowblood pressure for the right side of your mouth and a pill for highblood pressure for the left side of your mouth swallow both of them fast and you will be well by the next election it will not work george bush was right when he called it voodoo economics in heated debate there are often key facts in dispute let me give you one which is not disputed for all the talk by candidate reagan about balanced budgets and all the talk by president reagan about balanced budgets the administration holds no hope for a balanced budget until 1984or maybe 1985 according to the administrations own optimistic figures and accepting all their assumptions we are promised at besti emphasize at bestwe are promised another 128 billion in new budget deficits over the next 3 years the numbers are stunning computer folks have an old saying garbage in garbage out what they mean is that if you give your programer bad information the computer will give you bad results let me touch on three of the major assumptions we are offered as a guarantee that this untested program is somehow going to work a taxcut multiplier of 5 as against previous history in our nation and others of 2 being the best result you can expect but the assumption in the reagankempstockman plan is 5a multiplier of 5which has never happened anywhere in the free world as far as i know even rudy penner of the american enterprise institute noted there is no reason to think that a kemproth cut has 2 3 or 4 times the power of any other tax cut we have tried the white house assumption that interest rates will drop to 9 percent by the end of 1982 check with your banker and ask him if he believes that inflation will be running at 6 2 percent by christmas 1982 and will drop even lower after that there is an old story about a politician who visited a small town gathered voters in the town square and let fly with a long speech that detailed his program when he finished he paused then declared ladies and gentlemen thems my views and if you dont like emn then ill change em if the standard economic assumptions do not give the right numbers dave stockman simply changes the assumptions but they are phony they are wrong and they will not prove out you cannot even find people on wall street who believe that a magic economic elixir has been discovered who says some samples irving shapiro chairman of the du pont co in the wall street journal of march 9 1981 all weve got to rely on is an economic theory no businessman can run his company on an untried business theory and neither can a government sam nakagama chief economist for the investment firm of kidder peabody in the journal of commerce february 11 1981 when a republican treasury secretary calls for tax cuts to be enacted before expenditure cuts and amid double digit inflation and a rearmament program it is an invitation to financial disaster and from the republican ranks senator barry goldwater quoted by the associated press in the tucson citizen february 13 1981 i dont think it kemproth will work although i know thats not a popular thing to say i dont think reducing the average income tax by 20 or 200 is going to make a great deal of difference senator howard baker t he tennessee republican and distinguished h 6008 co senate majority leader on face the nation august 2 1981 what were doing is really a riverboat gamble were gambling that this new economics will work a real basic point in all of this is that the udallobeyreuss plan would have attacked high interest rates and provided for a balanced budgetnot with gimmicks or a riverboat gamble but with a sound and solid approach we had a chance to enact a plan with a real assurance of a balanced budget and we voted for one with a real assurance of 128 billion more in deficits now we must go ahead with what we have and i will do my part to help see that the reagan plan works but i doubt that it will year after year the american people have demonstrated that they want a balanced budget and yet when the time came we gave the taxpayers more deficit spending i fear we have played a cruel trick on the nation and that we may pay dearly for it in the years ahead"], [0.4938685894012451, 0.5061314105987549, 1, "today i rise to introduce a bill to improve the food safety laws of the united states while the current laws have served the nation well for over 75 years recent events have demonstrated the need to provide the food and drug administration and the secretary of hhs with the ability to respond with flexibility and to use the latest and best scientific knowledge available interest in substantial improvement of these laws is now nearly 5 years old since the beginning of major controversy over fdas decision to propose a ban on saccharin in march 1977 and continuing with the debate over the safety of nitrite numerous proposals have been developed to try to protect the public interest while permitting the appropriate level of scientific flexibility and administrative discretion some of the proposals have been too simplistic in their attempts to singlemindedly apply emerging and imperfect concepts like costbenefit analysis more recently others have been developed like s 1442 introduced by senator hatch that contain a number of new approaches but are both too complex administratively as well as too ambitious in the nature of some of the proposed changes the bill i introduce today has the advantage of examining these earlier proposals instead of reacting in either an emotional way during crisis situations or trying to change the world in one fell swoop it focuses on only the major problems in what is basically a good law it is intended to be concise in its approach to issues and will serve to focus the debate during the coming months the bill proposes six kinds of changes to the current food drug and cosmetic act first it recognizes as have the courts that there is a level of risk particularly in the area of indirect food additives that can be described as de minimis second it maintains a high standard of public safety while permitting the secretary to use the best scientific judgment available in determining safety by defining safe as a reasonable certainty that the risks of a substance under the intended conditions of use are insignificant because of existing interpretations this standard gives adequate legislative guidance to the fda without improving either quantitative risk assessment or an overly rigid congressional determination of safety third it permits the secretary to phase substances out of the food supply for periods of up to 5 years depending on the availability of substitutes and the nature of the health risk involved it also permits under narrow circumstances where no alternatives are available for critical substances the weighing of health benefits against health risks the bill does not permit the weighing of economic benefits to one part of the population against health risks to another fourth it authorizes the development of external peer review mechanisms for food safety decisions in either the national academy of sciences the federation of american societies of american biology or other institutions of the secretarys choice it does this in such a way that the decisionmaking authority still rests with the government on decisions and it permits all sides of questions including members of public interest groups to petition for review of decisions fifth the bill clarifies that the class of basic and traditional foods like potatoes peanuts nutmeg et cetera be held to a safety standard that requires the secretary to show that the use of these foods would be ordinarily injurious to health before he takes regulatory action as science proceeds the development of this category is necessary to insure that the fda does not have to take actions that are demonstrably foolish from the publics perspective for example if a cancercausing substance should be found in ordinary potatoes and it cannot be removed the secretary should not be in the position of either violating the law or banning potatoes sixth finally the bill simplifies the regulatory process for the issuance of tolerances for substances that rhould not be in foods like pcbs but which are often unavoidable current law discourages the setting of tolerances because the process is extremely burdensome by simplifying the process the fda will be able to let the public know what substances are in their food and permit the public to make informed decisions on the permissible levels in the absence of change decisions will continue to be made exclusively by bureaucratic fiat it is important to note that this change does not in any way change the governments responsibility to protect the public against these substances in the past much of the attention paid to the food safety laws has focused on the socalled delaney anticancer clause this is natural inasmuch as that clause represents the symbolic commitment of our society to protect us against any level of risk from cancer in our food supply it is a noble concept and one should not approach the changing of it lightly in examining the possibility of change i have increasingly come to the opinion however that we must have regulatory statutes that are both tough and realistic if the laws are to maintain the respect of the people with respect to the current delaney clause i now believe that first its importance in the actual administration of the statutes has been vastly overstated the general safety clause of the law is by far a more important tool in the regulatory arsenal second its absolutist approach ignores our ability to measure substances in increasingly small amounts and third its maintenance in an unchanged way is likely ultimately to bring the public agency that must enforce it into disrepute by forcing actions that may be demonstrably foolish because i strongly believe in the importance of a powerful but credible food and drug administration i think it is important to bring the delaney clause and the general safety clause into accord and to permit the secretary to judge with appropriate procedural safeguards when the risk of an added substance is insignificant if we do not do this explicitly by legislation we will be guilty of passing the buck back to the bureaucrats while permitting ourselves the luxury of strong criticism every time the agency does something we think is foolish this is bad public policy because it is ultimately destructive of respect for public institutions and the goals of the regulatory establishment that we have constructed as many of you know i have been strongly critical of many of this administrations actions in the health and safety regulatory arena i believe that many of the budget actions taken in the environmental protection agency for example are backdoor ways of dismantling public protection in the guise of regulatory relief in contrast i believe that this bill approaches regulatory reform in the serious and constructive fashion that the issue demands we do need to wrestle with the regulatory establishment we have created but we need to recognize the massive benefits in public protection that we have gained over the last decades i believe that this bill represents the kind of midcourse correction that will be good for both producers and consumers in the past months i have been critical of other attempts to change the law in my view that is part of the natural process of give and take on important public policy issues it is important to recognize however that senator hatch and many of my colleagues in the house have made important contributions in raising the right questions about the laws i look forward to working with all concerned parties to insure that the american

already critical air pollution problem the dpm planned and partially initiated is a system of automated vehicles operating on a 2 9mile gradeseparated guideway it will include 11 stations and facilities for transferring to other modes of travel at both ends it will run from the convention center to union station serving an area of 147 000 employees 12 000 residents and 1 500 businesses around 70 000 passengers per day will ride the system by 1990 the system will provide mobility reduce air pollution and will permit the heart of the los angeles region to operate it can be expanded easily implementation of a downtown people mover was adopted by the los angeles city council in 1974 as part of the official plan for the city the downtown people mover program was supported by the nixon ford and carter administrations in 1976 it competed with 38 other communities to be a part of our national policy it was selected as a tier 1 city and is the only tier 1 city which has a viable project in 1976 transportation secretary william coleman committed 11 million for engineering of the project he further stated that subject to environmental clearances and other statutory conditions it was umtas intention to provide up to 100 million from the discretionary capital grant fund to the project in april 1980 transportation secretary neil goldschmidt advised that dot would provide the full federal share of the estimated 175 million cost if the environmental requirements were met the environmental impact statement for the project was satisfactorily completed on july 14 as a consequence the 96th congress approved 41 5 million for the start of construction with 70 million projected for 1982 however because of federal spending reductions the supplemental bill before you reduces the 41 5 million to 28 5 million for fiscal year 1981 the consideration for fiscal year 1982 will not be 70 million but 13 million which represents the portion your committee deferred from the fiscal year 1981 spending at this time there is no commitment beyond the 1981 appropriations and no projection beyond 1982 for this project to date los angeles taxpayers have helped pay for construction of rapid transit systems in every major unitedstates city except their own the funding in the 1981 appropriations bill for the downtown people mover now proposed to be struck by the

important factor it was concern about rising costs in all transportation sectorscars buses and parking that attracted attention to people mover technology people movers are extremely cost effective low operating costs are possible through automation drivers are not required on board vehicles people movers operating in airports and at other locations show excellent public acceptance and safe operation with automated transit vehicles construction costs are also very reasonable today more than 15 million in private sector construction has gone into the los angeles downtown people mover the federal government has spent 18 7 million and other public agencies have contributed 6 million the 3 billion of new construction in los angeles adding 60 000 people to downtowns employment population will otherwise require more than 30 000 additional parking spaces the cost of these parking spaces is well over 500 milliona cost which eventually must be paid by downtown employees shoppers and visitors in the form of rapidly escalating parking fees just as important is the fact that downtown streets and freeways will not accommodate the additional cars and traffic the people mover will allow parking facilities to be built on the fringe of downtown and provide a quick safe and efficient method of transfer into the downtown area it will also tie in with regional transit service at the convention center and union station and encourage commuters to use amtrak commuter rail freeway express buses and carpools thereby reducing traffic congestion on approaching freeways over 47 percent

killed in the house of representatives if the bill dies the united states will revert to a 1949 farm act as a basic policy it contains no support for sugar even the 17 cent price in the farm bill being considered by congress is well below the local industrys production costs of around 20 cents a pound another aspect of the support price situation is the development of a substitute sweetener

in the months ahead of how much saving the sugar industry is worth to au uts for myself its quite a lot mfom the honolulu advertiser dec 12 1981 american sugar needs support to compreter by dr thomas k hitch the united states has not had an affirmative sugar policy since 1974 when the 1934 sugar act expired our sugar policy from 1934 to 1974 40 years was to have sugar prices stabilized in the american market by assigning marketing quotas based on unitedstates requir ements to domestic and foreign producers so that prices found a level that would be fair to both the american consumer and the american sugar producer since 1974with no sugar policythe price of raw sugar in the american market has been on a roller coasteras high as 65 cents in 1974 as low as 9 cents in 1976 as high as 44 cents in 1980 and now at about 16 cents the unitedstates beet and cane sugar producers cannot remain in business on a permanent basis with this kind of wild1ly fluctuating price levelwith two of the last eight years being boom years 74 and 80 one being barely profitable 1975 and the other five being deeply depressed years with tremendous losses even during these years the american consumer has not benefited because while there have been more years of cheap sugar than of dear sugar the price of sugar rose to such astronormical heights that it probably hurt the consumer more in those years than he has helped in the cheap years also when very high sugar prices push the price of randies ice cream soft drinks and baked goods up they tend to stay up after the price of sugar falls so that the american consumer to a certain extent lives with high sweetening prices even when sugar becomes cheap again to understand the world sugar market one has to realize that some 80 percent of the sugar produced in the world has a guaranteed home at a guaranteed price that prices in these countries do not fluctuate up and down with world under and overpro duction and that the socalled world price for sugar is set by demand and supply forces that affect only that 18 percent of the worlds sugar production that is uncommittedand therefore very cheap when world production is surplus and very dear when world production is short to put it another way all the major sugar exporting countries of the world have a government guaranteed set price for sugar boasumed in that country with the price set at a level that will make it profitable to grow sugar in such large quantities that it is a major export item this is truefor cuba brazil australik philippines south africa argentina india mexico and the eec as well as the rest of the smaller sugar exporting countries take the eec through its common agricultural policy cap european growers are not only guaranteed 27 cents a pound but are encouraged to produce excess sugar for export and in the last decade the eec has become a major exporter of subsidized sugar in contrast to having traditionally been a net importer of sugar european sugar is now being sold in large quantities in the unitedstates market when the price for raws is about 15 cents after paying shipping and insurance while the price in europe is 27 cents this situation is demonstrited by the fact that when the world sugar market price skyrocketed from about 10 cents a pound in 1973 to 65 cents a pound in 1974 there was no change in the domestic price of refined sugar in the countries that produced 60 percent of the worlds export sugar and only a modest change upward in the other export ing countrieswhile the price in the unitedstates more than doubled the same thing happened when world sugar prices fell furthermore most of the worlds sugar importing countries are buffered against fluctuations in this small but highly volatile world marketbuffered generally by longterm agreements with sugar exporting countries to provide them with a normal supply at a normal price this is shown by the fact that in that same period of rapid price rise 19731974 the countries that consumed 22 percent of all world sugar imports bad no change in the domestic price of sugar those accounting for 12 percent of world imports only a 1 to 15 percent rise and with only a handful of countries with the unitedstates being far and away the major one suffering from the full inflation of prices the socalled world sugar market being only a small fraction of world sugar production is a market where in periods of world sugar shortage the buyer pays exorbitant prices and where in periods of world surplus all homeless sugar is dumped if the unitedstates does not adopt a constructive sugar policy it will ultimately lose its domestic sugar industrywhich will be a considerable economic loss since among agricultural products sugar ranks tenth in terms of acreage fifth in terms of tonnage and sixth or seventh in terms of dollars to the farmer the unitedstates sugar industry will not be killed by cheap foreign sugar that is produced more efficiently than ours it will be killed by foreign sugar that is dumped into our market at either a loss to the producer or at a profit that is provided by subsidies from the government of origin unitedstates sugar production is probably among the most efficient in the worldjust like our production of wheat corn rice soya beans and many other agricultural products but it cannot live on a 12 cents or 15 cepits or even 17 cents per pound pricea price which incidentally is about the same as good top soil at your corner garden shop in short if the unitedstates were to require that foreign sugar not be allowed to be sold in the american market at a lesser price than it is sold for in the country of origin the unitedstates sugar industry would be profitable and have a long and successful life furthermore if we lost our domestic sugar industry the nation and its consumers would have to live with the roller coaster of the world sugar market and could even find itself facing an opeclike foreign sugar cartel since the top 13 sugar exporting nations ship about 80 percent of the sugar entering world tradenumbers much like those in the oil cartel finally if the unitedstates lost its domestic sugar industry it would face catastrophe in the event of war or major shipping interruptions let us remember that in such times sugar has always been about the first commodity to be rationed that napoleon developed the beet sugar industry when the british blockade stopped the flow of essential foreign sugar to europe and that all the countries of the world that protect their domestic sugar industries do so primarily because of these strategic considerations lets get an affirmative unitedstates sugar policy before it is too late"], [0.494292676448822, 0.505707323551178, 1, "the tobacco subsidy program is wrong the tobacco lobby knows it is wrong and no slightofhand will change that fact today the house debates a bill with the pleasantsounding but totally misleading title of the no net cost tobacco support program act of 1982 the speed with which this legislation was brought to the floor was indeed remarkable and very revealing of the power of tobacco lobby no hearings were conducted on this legislation in washington last year i was told that i could testify but no such opportunity was given to me the bill was introduced and reported by the subcommittee on june 15 the full agriculture committee reported it on june 16 the committee received permission to have until midnight on june 18 to file its report copies of the report were not available for review until this morning and now we take it up under suspension of the rules why is the tobacco lobby so afraid of letting the members of the house consider this legislation in a thoughtful manner they would have us believe that this bill does not affect the american people they would have us believe that it pertains only to the tobacco industry nothing could be further from the truth the commodity credit corporation borrows funds from the unitedstates treasury these funds are then loaned to the tobacco marketing associations and used to give nonrecourse loans to tobacco producers what the tobacco lobby fails to comprehend is that these funds come from the american taxpayer it is our taxes that treasury collects it is our money that it borrows it is our taxes that pay for the interest on the notes treasury sells the american taxpayer foots the bill for the tobacco subsidy program but the tobacco lobby does not want the peoples representatives to debate its pet program in a reasonable manner ii r 6590 should not have been considered under suspension of the rules the bill is flawed and no member will have an opportunity today to correct those flaws the house should not be misled by the title of this bill as presently drafted h r 6590 is vague and less precisely drafted than it could have been the bill may reduce the cost of the tobacco program but it will not establish a no net cost tobacco program first there is the question of administrative costs i realize that the agriculture and food act of 1981 exempted from any proposal the administrative costs common to the operation of all pricesupport programs but nevertheless these costs are costs of operating the tobacco support program i would like to bring to the attention of the house some facts with which the members might not be familiar on april 23 the general accounting office gao released a report titled tobacco programs production rights and effects on competition it makes for fascinating reading as you may know treasury loans money to ccc which in turn makes loans to the 13 tobacco marketing associations the associations make nonrecourse loans to producers a nonrecourse loan absolves the producers from any liability for losses incurred when the crop is sold gao pointed out that for those crop years where the tobacco taken under loans was sold 57 million in principal was not recovered this is a lose to ccc and therefore to the american taxpayers whose funds are loaned to ccc gao also noted that as of december 1981 fluecured loans outstanding for the 197580 crop years totaled 640 million loans have shifted mostly to less desirable grades that cannot be sold readily because they are priced higher than foreign tobacco of comparable quality if the tobacco is to be sold before it deteriorates price discounts probably will be necessary ccc therefore cannot expect to recover the full amount of its loans and a goodly portion of that 640 million in principal will be a loss h 3688 co i present this information to stress how important it is for us to understand exactly what constitutes a net loss under the language of h r 6590 section 101 of the bill only hints at what a net loss is the proposed section 106a d 1 of the agriculture act of 1949 states that the secretary of agriculture shall require contributions that will result in accumulation of a fund adequate to re inburse the corporation for any net losses which the corporation may sustain with the association the proposed section 106a d 3 states that the fund shall be used exclusively for the purpose of insuring that the ccc will suffer no net losses including but not limited to recovery of the amount of loans extended to cover the overhead costs of the association after net gains are applied to net losses of the ccc that parenthetical clause is the only definition of net loss in the entire bill gao had indicated that in the past ccc had lost 57 million in principal on loans it most likely wi1 lose millions more on the 640 million outstanding to date on fluecured tobacco i know that ccc will lose millions on 1982 and subsequent crops that cannot be sold for the cost of the loan that in my opinion is a net loss that should be recovered by the fund and that should have been spelled out specifically in the bill otherwise we may find regulations effectively limiting the liability of associations and increasing the cost of the program to the american taxpayer every month when millions of americans send a check to a thrift institution as payment on their mortgages the money is applied first to accumulated interest and then to principal tobacco associations do not operate that way gao noted that since 1966 cash received from loan repayments is applied first to loan principal and then after the principal is liquidated to interest receivable this procedure is inconsistent with cccs procedures for repaying its treasury borowings and with normal banking pro cedures gao also noted that treasury charges ccc interest on daily outstanding balance owed which includes unpaid interest on borrowings from prior periods the associations however pay interest to ccc on the daily outstanding principal balance which do not include interest from prior periods thus associations are able to reduce their principal quickly and then pay interesta lot less interest than otherwise owed using data for the crop years 197880 gao estimat ed that ccc lost 2 million in interest in fiscal year 1980 alone this is bad banking and bad business but it has been happening for 16 years without even a legal basis in a letter report to me dated june 16 1982 gao confirmed that there is no statutory authority for this action ccc recognizes this and it advised gao that it would change its procedures as of june 16 however no change has been made i submit that given past practices congress cannot depend on ccc to correct itself congress must require that proceeds be applied first to interest and then to principal like every other business loan in this country i must commend ccc for one good decision however reluctantly it was made up to april 1981 tobacco support loans were made at lowerthanmarket interest rates since that date loans have been made at the same interest rates charged by the treasury but consider the cost to the taxpayer over the years agriculture officials calculated that the amount of interest paid to the treasury since the inception of the program through fiscal year 1980 could total 845 million ccc records indicate however that it had collected 254 million or a net loss of 591 million cccs comptroller could not attest to the figures because interest expense was based on yearly beginning and ending average loan balances and the interest income was based on probably incomplete docu mentation the gao report means that the american taxpayer has been financing the tobacco support program through losses in interest that should have been collected if ccc had charged the associations what it cost ccc to borrow funds and that ccc continues to lose money through improper procedures for determining interest on outstanding loans nothing in this bill prevents ccc from continuing its old ways i submit therefore that in the few remaining years of the tobacco support program that program should be administered efficiently and properly h r 6590 contains no guidance in this area next comes the subject of net gains defined in the bill as the amount by which total proceeds obtained from the sale of a crop exceed the principal amount of the pricesupport loan plus interest and charges the april gao report noted that now net gains are distributed to the producers h r 6590 in its proposed section 106a d 5 of the agriculture act of 1949 would require net gains to be used to offset any losses sustained by ccc under its loan agreements with an association for 1982 and subsequent year crops but the proposed section 106a d 6 permits the secretary if he determines that the net gains exceed the amounts needed to cover losses to release the excess to the association which may use it for other purposes now remember that these are nonrecourse loans once the producer receives money for his crop the crop belongs to the association and indirectly to ccc ccc assumes the risk for these loans if the proceeds are insufficient to cover the principal of the loan it also should receive the benefit of a net gain in the sale of the crop why should the associations and perhaps through them the producers receive a windfall this too is a cost to the taxpayer in that the net gains could be used by ccc to offset losses incurred in its dealings with other associations participating in the program before i conclude i would like to comment on some of the other provisions of this bill i preface these remarks with the caveat that because of the lack of a committee report i have not been able to study h r 6590 us well as i would have liked the adjustment in price support levels is cosmetic insofar as i am concerned permitting the sale of allotments apart from the land does not do as much as one might think it still permits the allotment program to continue in addition sales of allotments could occur only within the same county thereby perpetuating the unnecessary concentration of tobacco production individuals who own a farm but who do not farm the land themselves may still have allotments equal to 50 percent of the farms tillable cropland this perpetuates the feudalistic system of leasing allotments i try to be a reasonable man i do not believe that the perfect should be the enemy of the good this is not a completely tinedeemed bill the reforms it envisions just do not go far enough through this bill however the tobacco lobby has admitted that the tobacco program indeed costs the american taxpayer money even if it does not reveal how much the bill also opens up for the first time a special interest subsidy program in his colloquy with me the gentleman from north carolina agreed to hold comprehensive hearings next year and to consider some of the improvements that could be made to this bill to minimize the cost of the program to the american people we do not need a tobacco support program i remain committed to the elimination of this feudalistic program which is nothing more than welfare for a privileged class but as long as we have a program it should be operated at no net cost to the american taxpayer i do not believe that ccc knows how to operate a no net cost program h r 6590 despite its efforts in section 101 fails to make the present unwarranted program less offensive to the average american taxpayer who is subsidizing the tobacco allotment owner pending the elimination of the tobacco program i am prepared to work for the least costly tobacco support program possible"], [0.4943692088127136, 0.5056307911872864, 1, "to delete funding for thle mx missile system he and others have spoken to the absurdity of the proposed multibilliondollar investmentnot only from a military standpoint but also from the perspective of a country struggling to reduce the rapid pace of the nuclear arms race if we are truly serious about strengthening our defense capability we will today put an end to this kind of wasteful unjustified expenditure the proposed mx missile program represents nothing more than a tremendous diversion of critical resources away from areas of genuine need both within and outside of the defense budget study after study has concluded that our most pressing military need is not the purchase of increasingly costly and sophisticated nuclear weaponry rather our needs are in the conventional forces areain the improvement of the morale and competence of our personnel in the provision and maintenance of our basic equipment in the adequacy of basic logistical support yet as the country gears up for a massive nuclear buildup it is these elements of our military preparednesselements essential to real national securitythat are by and large ignored perhaps the greatest absurdity of the mx is that it is proposed as a means of enhancing american deterrence when our nuclear forces already provide a tremendously powerful counterthrect to soviet aggression to put the issue of our nuclear deterrent in perspective it should be noted that even if the soviet union launched a first strike against the united statesa strike that was so extraordinarily successful that it totally eliminated our landbased nuclear force our airborne nuclear fleet and all the nuclear submarines that are in port at any one timethere would remain at sea 20 nuclear submarines each carrying 16 missiles each missile carrying 8 to 10 warheads each warhead having an explosive power seven times that of the bomb that fell on hiroshima these 20 subs alone would be sufficient to destroy every major economic industrial and population center in the soviet union three times over in terms of accuracy size and survivability the unitedstates nuclear force is more than sufficient to deter soviet aggression and in the absence of any operable agreement on strategic arms limitation the decision to develop even greater nuclear capability will only fuel the already growing threat of a major and destabilizing arms race but these are military arguments that have been addressed and addressed effectively by those who have proceeded me i think what really requires discussion at this point are the broader implications of the approach that we appear to be taking to national defense issuesan approach that is symbolized by the mx missile debate what is happening is thatout of a sense of fear unsupported by evidence or reasonwe are indiscriminantly throwing dollars at the pentagon and in the process we are ending up with less security rather than more moreover the kind of unnecessary and uineconomic military investment which we consider todaythe quintessential example of which is the mx missileundermines the very economic foundations of our nation and thereby our national security it is difficult to conceptualize the sheer magnitude of the defense program being promoted by the administration over the next 5 years the united states will spend over 1 6 trillion on defense 1 6 trillion if we were to spend that sum at the rate of 1 million per day 365 days a year it would take over 4 000 years to exhaust the war chest put another way over the course of the next 5 years we will be spending on the average 830 million a day on defense alone the economic implications of the defense buildup are staggering last fall the pentagon asked such luminaries as the nobel laureate lawrence klein otto eckstein and michael evans along with forecasting firms such as chase econometrics and merrill lynch economics to examine the impacts of rising military spending their conclusion large increases in the military budget will lead to greater deficit spending and with tax reductions exceeding cuts in social spending the defense increases will push the federal budget even further into the redmeaning continuing high interest rates and continuing high rates of inflation but that is only part of the economic cost of wasteful and excessive military spending economists are also warning us that our defense spending binge by diverting scarce capital and technical expertise away from other sectors of our economy threatens directly our efforts to revitalize our private industrial base we are all keenly aware of the tremendous difficulties the united states has encounteredin recent years in the competition with the germans and japanese and the explanation for our difficulties is traceable directly to their relatively greater commitment of capital to the private sectors of their economies over the past decade american fixed capital investment as a percentage of our nations gross national product ranged between 17 percent and 19 percent during the same period german fixed capital investment was between 20 percent and 26 percent of gnp and japanese fixed capital investment was in the 31 percent to 36 percent range is it any wonder that modem and efficient japanese and german firms have been able to overtake the aging american industrial system for emphasis it should be noted that in 1977 for every 100 of new fixed capital formation the united states applied 46 to the military sector in sharp contrast in japan only 3 70 of every 100 of new fixed capital formation was applied to the military this concentration of japans capital on productive economic growth goes far to explain the current success of that countrys industry where productivity grew 6 2 percent in 1980 by contrast aging plants and equipment in the united states led to a decrease in the average output per person in manufacturing industries of 0 5 percent the important point in the context of the legislation before us is that this economic disparity will only widen if we fal to bring defense spending under control and if we fail to recognize the overall economic impact of wasteful defense expenditures as economist bruce russett has noted every dollar in military spending results in a new loss of over 27 cents in fixed investment in civilian goods and a drop in personal consumption of 42 cents interest sensitive sectors like housing and durable goods cars appliances and furniture are especially hard hit when excessive arms spending bids up the cost of borrowing this loss of investment and consumption to the military decreases longterm growth opportunities making job creation difficult and preventing any growth in real wages if in the process of arming america we allow our countrys economy to decay i submit that we will have only weakened our nations security clearly the question before us today is not whether we can afford both guns and butter we can and must afford both but what we cannot afford is waste and extravagancebe that in domestic or in military programs and we must recognize that our national security is as dependent upon our economic strength as it is upon the number of missiles in our nuclear arsenal this is the real meaning of the amendment

sale of awacs to saudi arabia this debate is not just aboutsaudi arabia or awacs planes what we are debating is something far more profound and far reaching the decisions we make today combined with those to be made in the other body will have a deep and his tonec effect on our future as a power for peace in the mideast the heart of this issue is not awacs technology but foreign policy not the security of one type of aircraft but thb security of our nation the western alliance and our friends in the mideast let us look at some of the questions before us some say we should not give the saudi the awacs unless there are americans to man them others question the alleged insecurity of the awacs technology in saudi hands i recall a story i heard the other day a highranking administration of ficial was being questioned by a distinguished member of the other body about the awacs deal the administration official said to the senator if the saudi dont buy awacs from us theyll simply turn around and buy a similar plane from the british and the senator replied let them buy it from the british if thats what they want and so the administration official said if you have no objection to the saudi pos jessing the technology as such why not let the united states make the sale instead of great britain and the senators reply to that was my time is up and i have no further questions ~ a vote against this sale is not going to deprive the saudi arabians of sophisticated flying radar technology is there anyone who doubts the capacity of the british nimrod to eventually perform awacs tasks does anyone doubt the saudis will buy the nimrod it is only a matter of money and the saudis have plenty of that if the saudis buy nimrods there will be no joint control of the plane so what are we gaining by forcing the saudis into a situation which deprives usof any chance of influencing the use of this technology is awacs a threat to israeli security of course not the israelis know perfectly well the saudis and other arab nations cannot mesh technologles in such a way that the saudi awacs could direct arab aircraft in a war against israel may i add one more point concerning the security question for over 30 years the united states of america has been sending our most sophisticated weapjons systems to the state of israel but since the creation of the state of israel there has not been a single day when anyone could guarantee the survival or security of israel they have always lived on the brink of destruction for over 30 years we have been told we must give israel every new weapon system it wants because it is in constant danger of disaster but suppose we had replied we cannot give israel high technology equipment because israels security is threatened we risk capture of our stateoftheart weapons technology israels security from invasion is too unstable to trust them with sophisticated weaponry which might fall into the wrong hands would not such an argument be missing the point in giving threatened israel sophisticated weaponry for over 30 years we have not taken counsel of our fears we have instead followed our commonsense that israels possession of high technology equipment is in our interests despite the risks it could possibly fall into enemy hands the same argument should hold true when it comes to saudi arabia the united states should not base its policy on fear but on selfinterest we are told that the fate of the shah of iran is a warning to us all do not sell sophisticated equipment to an autocratic ruler in the mideast because it will fall into the hands of our enemies the only thing wrong with such an argument is that it is based on a totally false analogy the iranians and the arabs are different people with different histories different customs different forms of government and different geopolitical roles the shah tried to force feed irans military modernization process thereby alienating many iranians the sadidis have used 72 to 90en of its military agreements with the united states to buy construction services infrastructures training and other elements the shah was opposed by irans religious leaders the saudi family faces no such opposition and is in fact closely tied to the religious leaders the shah changed leadership in his armed forces so often there was complete chaos the saudis have had great stability and continuity in its command structure and ministerial leadership since the 1060s so the analogies with iran are simply false we have an entirely different situation in saudi arabia what about the alleged threat to internal security from the millions of foreign workers who are in saudi arabia that threat cannot be dismissed lightly but it also cannot logically stand in the way of the sale if an internal threat to the saudi kingdom is so great that our awacs will be threatened the disaster will go beyond the mere capture or destruction of awacs it will engulf all of saudi arabia itself the loss of awacs will be the least of our worries besides if such a massive and imminent threat exists it wtll occur before we sell the awacs and if the danger is not immediate how can we predict what is going to happen in 1985 or 1090 the united states is irrevocably tied to saudi arabia for the foreseeable future economically and geopolitically our two nations hay mutual interests we may not like it some of our constituents may not like it mr begin certainly does not like it but like it or lump it the saudis need us and we need them i am not one of those who say we should be nice to the saudis because they allegedly hold down the price of oil we all know they charge exactly what is in their longrange interests no we should act only in our selfinterest and yes i am as irritated as anyone over the saudi reluctance to cooperate with american strategic initiatives in the mideast they have been uncooperative when it comes to the question of american forward bases and our role in regional security but it stands to reason that not selling them awacs will not make them any more cooperative it will only make matters worse what about the concerns of many americans over the effect this sale will have on the state of israel as one who believes that israel is vital to the national security interests of the united states i am convinced i 7ils figure comes from saudi arabia awacs and americas search for strategic stability in the near east a publication of the international security studio program of the wilson center smithsonian institute building washington d c by all the available evidence this sale will not endanger the security of israel nobody is asking israel and saudi arabia to like each other we are not running a computer dating service for mideast lonely hearts all wve are saying is that despite mutual dislike those nations have common enemies that can destroy either or both helping the saudis will not harm israelunless israel decides to perceive such help as harmful and we should not make policy based on the perceptions of other countries saudi arabia will not go away the geopolitical problems of the mideast will not vanish the hard strategic decisions will not suddenly be solved by denying awacs to the saudis our two nations are bound together like contestants in a thrceeegged race at a picnic we may be uncomfortable together we may stumble and find fault with each other but we have to learn to move together or else we both will lose summing up we find that every argument presented against this sale has no foundation in fact the awacs will not be a threat to israel but the nimrod might be a threat according to findings of the senate foreign relations committee joint control of the awacs does not guit the saudis but if they buy nimrod there wvill be no joint control and americans will have absolutely no voice in how the information is used we are told that awacs cannot help the saudis against soviet attack that is absolutely correct but it can help the saudis against air attacks from soviet client states you cannot logically argue that awacs is good enough to threaten israel and then argue it is not good enough to help defend the saudis from attack but that is exactly what opponents of this sale have argued voting against awacs will not stop the saudis from gaining awacstype technology all it will do is insure that we do not have a part in selling the technology training the crews and monitoring the information on a xetltime basis is this what those opposed to the sale want i do not think so but it is exactly

finished for the past 6 months we have labored mightily on a task of unprecedented importance to the wellbeing of our nation today we can put the capstone of our efforts into place by approving the administrations bipartisan tax package and by giving this administration a chance to do that which the voters asked itand usta do last november my decision to support the bipartisan tax package came only after a long and thorough scrutiny of the facts of the situation i kept my options open until all cards had been laid on the table and in the end i decided to support the administrations plan for several key reasons first the acrosstheboard cuts in marginal income tax rates and the timely removal of present tax penalties on investment income will generate badly needed savings among middle and higher income earners second the bipartisan package will increase the takehome pay of all workers over a 3year period while easing the burden of inflation third the plan through accelerated depreciation will generate more cash flow for industry and will stimulate increased development in newer more productive plants and equipment finally the bipartisan plan recognizes the contribution of small businesses to our economy and it includes several measures to strengthen their position the turning point in my deliberations over this crucial vote however came when i saw that the administrations proposal is the best plan for the average american worker and hence the people of my home state of maine and the northeast region of the country all of us have been inundated with information on this facet of the taxcut bills and we have heard each side proclaim its bill as the friend of the worker this aspect is important to my constituents because theyare by and large hard work~ers who earn only moderate incomes with this in mind i studied the two plans before us today i saw that social security increases under president carter and inflationfueled tax bracket creep will total about 22 percent for the average family in the next 2 years i then saw that the democratic plan calls for only 15 percent in tax cuts during that period an amount which will not cover these builtin hikes i asked myself if i could in good conscience tell my constituents that i had voted them a tax cut after supporting the democratic plan and i determined that i could not i also heard the claims from the other side of the aisle that their tax cuts are directed toward moderateincome groupsthose with average incomes between 10 000 and 50 000 per year under the administrations package this income bracket which now pays 72 percent of the personal income taxes collected by the federal government will receive 74 percent of the tax cut savings i find this equitablemuch more equitable than tax increases of 400 billion forced on the american people over the last 10 years while we simultaneously gave lip service to five socalled tax cuts one source of particular pride to me concerning the administrations bill is the fact that my colleagues and i on the small business committee were able to give muchneeded assistance to small business through this legislation we hear so much about big business in this day and age that we often forget the importance of small business to our society our nations 18 million small businesses are a leading source of jobs innovation investment and savings in our economy they account for 60 percent of existing employment 80 percent of new jobs and half of all industrial innovation numbers like these cannot be ignored and the administrations bill does not neglect them the bipartisan package increases equipment writeoffs for small business to 10 000 by 1986 it increases tax credits for the purchase of used equipment it raises the limits of taxexempt accumulated earnings from 150 000 to 200 000 per year finally it increases the allowable number of stockholders for small corporations from 15 to 25 also i am extremely pleased that the hanceconable tax plan includes a 15percent tax credit for woodburning stoves which is not included in the ways and means bill since woodburning stoves are widely used in the state of maine it will provide the financial incentive necessary for individuals to install woodburning stoves the tax credit will also serve a demonstration of support by the federal government for the effectiveness of woodburning stoves as an energy alternative in reducing the nations consumption of oil the maine people should be commended for their efforts in significantly conserving their usage of home heating oil finally it is truly unfortunate that we were forced to include a wide variety of extraneous provisionssocalled sweetenersto satisfy the special interests of this country it is too bad that we could not be voting today on a clean tax billone that was aimed solely at giving the american people a long overdue tax break but that is the nature of the legislative process and the administrations proposal is certainly the best one before us today i must also confess that certain provisions in both tax bills before us today tempted me to vote against all tax bills i am speakinig of the provisions included in both bills to provide tax reductions for the oil industry some of us supported a rules change to lift the oil industry cuta out of todays bill and to show them the light of day but our efforts were rejected it is unfortunate that in order to give our people a muchdeserved tax break we also had to capitulate to special interests and simultaneously give the oil companies a tax break we ignored the fact that oil companies already receive extensive special tax provisions in our laws we ignored the reality that oil companies would receive the general business tax breaks included in these bills we ignored the recent astronomical price hikes and profits of oil companies and instead we camouflaged more breaks for big oil into a forest of tax legislation nevertheless i will vote with the administration today while i do not agree with certain provisions of this legislation i do not think it is fair to deny the american people meaningful tax relief any longer our economic problems are well known the solution to these woes is less certain but the administrations plan i believe offers a more realistic change to get our economy moving again we have acted in this chamber in recent weeks to set a new economic course and today we should keep that course"], [0.5069329738616943, 0.5069329738616943, 0, "curing the economic problems of michigan and other northern industrial states will require both creative solutions and unprecedented cooperation my colleague mr pursell of michigan has taken a very thoughtful and pragmatic leadership role in this effort his recent speech to the new england society of newspaper editors and publishers is an outstanding analysis of this dilemma and i include his remarks in the record as follows oxiz nationindxvxsxmze by carl 1 pursml it is certainly an honor for this congressman from michigan to bring his message to this gathering of the distinguished new england society of newspaper editors and publishers the topic at hand requires the critical examination broad perspective and practical application characteristic of editors and publishers a group known for getting to the point and demanding appropriate action ironically it may have been one of our most wellknown editors and publishers whose words are most associated with the problems of the northeast midwest region everyone remembers the wordsf of the new york tribunes horace greeley when he said go west young man those words were more than advisory they were prophetic from now until the year 2000 the census bureau expects the population of the socalled sun belt to grow at a rate four times that of the 18 states of the northeast and midwest the real reason as you know is not climate but jobs and while employment opportunities grow in the south and west the capital investment that creates jobs is lagging in our region during the past decade capital investment in the sun belt was nearly twice that of the northeast midwcst bome of the socalled experts have wit nessed this trend and proclaimed it inevitable as though it were some kind of modern extension to the concept of manifest destiny and seeing these developments in those terms these experts have solemnly advised the people of our region to stop their economic suffering forthwith and move to where the jobs are i think we would all question such advice you may not recall as readily another svored quote of horace greely the wusion that times that were are better than those that are has probably pervaded all ages i strongly believe that it is also an illusion to think that the times to be will not be better than those that are in short the best days for our region are ahead of us not in the golden days of the past by and large jobs are where you make them and with the proper balanced concern for the needs of the nation at large we can stand and act in accordance with that fact a continental country such as ours can do no less for it would make powerful little sense to move generation after generation of americans across our great land mass in quest of an elusive and everchanging job market such a policy would not only be economically infective but just plain inhumane our very history argues against it dec ades ago the federal government began to pursue a deliberate policy of investing billions of dollars in the economic revival of the south and development of the west massive amounts of dollars were poured into rural electrification projects like tva port construction military bases defense projects space programs oil subsidies tobacco and peanuts allotments and on and on the great northeast and midwest peoples never thought to question this policy because they were and are above all else americans with the greater interest of their nation at heart they never once thought that their own prosperity would suffer for having extended the hand of the federal government on behalf of their fellow americans in other regions but the times they are achanging the moment has come to realize that in economic terms the west has been won and the south has been reconstructed now it is time to draw a lesson from history and be reminded that what worked for the south and west will also work for the north and midwest which is ravished by an industrial complex badly in need of reconstruction and modernization needless to say our region desperately requires the industrial revenue base needed to rebuild its cities and to modernize its aging network of bridges road water and sewer systems yet despite these gaping needs the 18 states of the northeast and midwest collectively sent 165 billion more of their treasure to washington than they got back between 1975 and 1979 my state of micli gan gets back about 66 cents for every dollar going to our nations capital if we continue as we have we face an economnic balkanization that will serve no ones best interestsleast of all the nations one of the most vital tests for america today is whether we can frame a rational national economic development plan and in so doing avoid the terrible pitfall of creating economic upheavals that pit one region against another the truth is our various regions are parts of a single economic whole they are dependent on one another with each offering unique strengths and special resources the others lack the 18 states of the northeast and midwest spend too much time emphasizing problems rather than proclaiming how much we have to offer that the nation needs and can benefit from for example the great lakes st lawrence system and other sources provide the worlds largest supply of fresh water a vast expensive infrastructure including huge plant capacities and an integrated transportation system is in place and capable oi serving millions of people in large cities and smaller communities in an effective manner at far less than the cost of replacing it from the ground up our varied terrain provides opportunity for a wide assortment of activities while a continuous round of changing seasons presents excellent working conditions i might add at this point that the nickname frost belt is a misnomer for our climate is among the most temperate in the world minerals timber and other raw materials are abundant throughout and a varied mix of oil gas coal and hydroelectric energy remain in plentiful supply soil climate and other factors enable the region to not only feed its people but to export food and fiber throughout the world we have some of the worlds finest schools unparalleled research capabilities and a strong feeling of individual pride and community loyalty that cannot be measured the regions greatest resource is of course its peoplea skilled and motivated work force ready and willing to continue making productive contributions in existing industries while ready to meet the special demands of new technologies in congress i have been working primarily through two groups in an effort to secure equitable treatment of all regions by the federal government and to promote the positive contributions our region can make to the nation first the bipartisan northeast midwest congressional coalition of which i am a member of the steering committee and cochairman of its budget task force secondly an ad hoc group of northern republicans commonly referred to as the gypsy moths of which i am chairman most of the efforts of these two groups this yearlike those of congresshave centered around president reagans economic recovery program as you undoubtedly know i actively support the basic components of the presidents program and voted for the key implementing legislation when it came before the house of representatives namely reducing federal spending so as to beat inflation and bring down interest rates reducing individual and business taxes to provide investment capital and leave more money in the hands of workers and working to develop a bigger national economic pie rather than struggling over a shrinking pie that sets region against region and interest group against interest group while strongly supporting the presidents bottom line i believe that a certain amount of negotiating should take place in order to avoid certain rcgional distortions and other difficulties for example i had introduced legislation to phase in the tax cut over a fiveyear period rather than three years my greatest concerns related to the regional effects of rapidly raising defense spending while significantly decreasing domestic programs meanwhile conservative southern democrats now known as the boll weevils continue their traditional demands as the price for votes on key legislation year after year no matter who is president the boll weevils fight for three basic areas of immense benefit to their region public works 2 oil tax breaks and 3 defense spending let me give a typical example of each of these areas 1 the controversial tennesseetombigee projecta waterway running parallel to the mississippi riverreceived administration support and the house passed its fiscal year 1982 appropriations by a vote of 208 to 198 it is estimated that this project alone will eventually cost about 3 billion 2 oil tax breaks in the economic recovery act including exemptions to the windfall profits tax will cost over 12 billion during the iext three years 3 the administrations 15year defense plan calls for 1 46 trillion through fiscal year 1986 this is a particular boon to the sun belt as 80 percent of all dod employees are concentrated in the south and west california and georgia alone have more than all of the 18 states in our region combined in fact over the last decade defense department employment in the northeast midwest actually declined by about 30 percent it is our view that several billion dollars could be shifted from the proposed lncrrase in defense to needed domestic programs of vital importance to our region while not in any way harming national security in fact such a move could be helpful before completing his term of office earlier this year the distinguished comptroller general elmer b staats identified up to 10 billion in dod mismanagement and waste the house republican research committee has outlined as much as 25 billion savings through reductions in waste fraud abuse along with a restructuring of the procurement process in addition we are concerned that a too rapid increase in defense spending could even have a harmful effect on the military experts have predicted shortages of skilled labor in defense industriesespecially in the south capacity will be strained and managerial oversight stretched thin resulting in substantial costs overruns while my coalition and glypsy moth colleagues generally agree that a responsible trimming of the defense request will focus needed attention on the best way to achieve a truly effective military and strengthen defense by strengthening the economy there is less agreement on what domestic programs should be given the greatest emphasis this is due to the great diversity within our region the priorities of downtown manhattan are often not the same as those of the hills of vermont we fuund that out when we tried to help jim jeffords get that tax credit for wood burning stoves nevertheless we have had modest success during the past yea r in negotiating for the region for example president regan personally pledged i o me his support for continuation of a 3 4 billion test program targeting defense spending to high unemployment areasthe socalled maybank program the administratiorn agreed to shift approximately 2 7 billion ir budget priorities in the omnibus reconciliation act enacted in august from that originally called for in the spring this included funds for health medicaid education student loans vocational education youth training transportation amtrak conrail and mass transit as well as for energy conservation programs such as low income energy assistance and weatherization projects provisions were added to the tax bill to encourage rehabilitation of existing plants rather than moving operations to the south and west cooperative research and develop activities between private industry and universities and special tax treatment of tools used in automobile production i am proud of our work and i am thankful for the progress we have made but it is only a beginning representing a relatively small part of the effort needed to ensure lasting success so much of our work has been simply to retain what i call maintenance programs such as food stamps school lunches health care unemployment benefits and others vitally important but which do not contribute directly to our future growth and development needless to say we must continue this work but it must also be expanded ceta positions must be replaced by productive jobs in the private sector not welfare benefits health research must provide answers that replace health care benefits with preventative health practices high technology applications must supply the jobs laid off autoworkers cannot find on the assembly line if people are to live productive lives in the intercity they must be able to provide themselves with adequate housing transportation and education as a county commissioner i struggled with these issues hoping that the property tax along with revenues from state and federal government would provide the resources for meeting local needs as a state senator i struggled with the same problems but from a slightly different perspective that time i hoped that the income and sales taxes coupled with uncle sams contributions would balance the budget now as a member of congress i find that i am looking for answers to the same problems from yet another perspective while each level of government is working toward many of the same goals there exists a profound degree of fragmentation and isolation particular federal programs may or may not meet the peculiar needs of a certain community but the mayor or city manager grabs whatever federal funds are available and works them into a patchwork of federal state and local revenues in an effort to meet a strained budget state officials present their federal budget priorities not in terms of which programs are most effective but which ones will provide the most dollars as they work desperately to balance their budgets meanwhile mimbcrs of congress are presented with such a vast array of demands and corresponding programs that they can hardly keep up with their content and legislative status to say nothing of their implementation unfortunately government officials do not have a monopoly on this parochial method for dealing with problems competition and lack of communication are often the rule in relations between labor and management private industry and the schools producing future employees and yes cocasionally even between leader of the press and the communities they serve where 0 where do we stop and take a coordinated look at the needs of a particualr community or region and develop a comprehensive plan for its development and operation instead we continue living in a vacuum from year to year with little planning on a longterm basis and even less coordination among related jurisdictions in my view if we truly are to deal with our problems in an effective manner we must address the chaotic situation li have just described we must do it by region within states and we must do it by region within the united states in that regard i would like to share briefly with you two proposals i have advanced together with the detroit news i have suggested a statewide leadership conference in my home state of michigan to serve as a catalytic mechanism for key decisionmakers to sit down together and hammer out a comprehensive agenda it would consist of a working group of 6075 peoplelarge enough to reflect the spectrum of michigans people and interests but small enough to allow meaningful interaction with one another some years ago i organized a similar broadbased conference to set an agenda for the future of communities around my home town it has been extremely successful in identifying goals and producing results secondly i discussed with president reagan and subsequently presented the white house with a draft of a proposal for creation of a northeast midwest economic advisory council the general purpose of which would be to assemble members of congress governors mayors and other representatives of each level of government federal state and local within the region to advise the president and congress with respect to the federal governments role in helping meet the problems of the northeast midwest as well as in the development and use of the areas vast resources i see four main functions of such a council it would 1 serve as the governments focal point in considering the ne nws regional implications of federal policy 2 gather information necessary from public and private sources for meaningful consideration of these implications 3 serve as a vehicle by which representatives of the private sector as well as public officials can interact with federal personnel during the policy making process and 4 advise the president and congress on a continuing basis issuing formal reports when appropriate this is of course just one proposal and i welcome your reactions to it as well as challenge you to come forth with any other creative ideas for affecting the decisionmaking process in such a way as to best serve simultaneously the interests of our region and the nation as well it is essential that this goal be met to everyones good fortune the economy of the sun belt will continue to thrive but that growth does not require the continued decline of our region over time the supposed advantages of the sun belt may pale more growth means more population more urban problems increased taxes additional pollution etc o"], [0.5067527294158936, 0.5067527294158936, 0, "this is it we have had a tremendous amount of discussion on the fiscal year 1983 budget it is now time to discuss and act on the need for a balanced budget resolution this budget contains all the elements that so many of my colleagues in this body have talked about for the last 7 and 8 months there is no addon deficit in this budget this budget will sent the strongest signal both to main street and wall street and will be a tremendous incentive to bring down interest rates i have heard that need expressed time and time again especially from this side of the aisle i would like to review with the members of this body the facts supporting the rousselot balanced budget substitute amendment to the first concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1983 the balanced budget substitute ac complishes the following balances outlays with anticipated revenues at 701 75 billion for fiscal year 1983 by restraining increases in spending in comparison the budget committee recommends a deficit of nearly 100 billion recognizes the unexpended and unobligated federal fund balances that have been accumulating while the bureaucracies try to figure out how to spend the money which has been authorized by the end of fiscal year 1983 over a billion in unobligated funds will have accumulated for the various bureaucracies to spend in addition a like amount will have accumulated in pension reserves total unobligated balances are substantial the federal bureaucracy will not starve under the balanced budget substitute takes into account waste and fraud in the government which is encouraged by excessive federal spending according to the justice department fraud may be costing the government as must as 25 billion per year fiscal belt tightening will encourage the federal agencies to be more careful with the peoples money the balanced budget substitute offered in previous years has experienced growing support among the members of the house in 1975 when i first introduced it it received 95 aye votes in 1978 it received 170 aye votes and in may 1980 this balanced budget resolution received 191 ayes to 218 noes only a 27vote margin the reason the reason is simple the balanced budget substitute is based on an economic model which soundly stresses the interrelationships between large deficits and low productivity high tax rates and low productivity and high interest ratescaused by excessive money growth and federal borrow ingand increasing tax rates together these factors influence our tax revenues and rate of economic growth unfortunately the interrelationships of these factors is not well understood by some of the members of this body large deficits and higher tax rates will impede our nations economic development the members of this house have a chance to vote on our balanced budget substitute which does incorporate the interrelationship of these factors a yea vote will be for less government lower taxes no deficits less inflation lower interest rates and more productivity and greater employment opportunities a nay vote will be for more government bigger deficits more inflation higher interest rates less productivity and more unemployment this will slow down federal spending exactly the way many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have talked about for the last several months spending will be at a level of 701 75 billion revenues at 701 75 billion for a balanced budget this will be a tremendous incentive to all of the various sectors of the economy that in congress we have finally lived up to our responsibility to live within our means we have talked about it we have discussed it we have rehashed it now you can vote for it right now with one positive constructive vote many of our colleagues have said they are concerned about small business and agriculture and all of the other phases of our economy that are now in recession this is the responsible budget resolution to vote for to give encouragement and stimulus to small business how do we do that the national federation of independent business nfib an organization with inexcess of 650 000 members has sent each of the members of congress a letter which said we endorse this budget resolution as the best way to provide stimulus and help to small business why because it takes away the tremendous addon deficit that all i repeat all the other resolutions contain there will be no new deficit spending required under this resolution that means that there will be less competition by the treasury of the united states in the marketplace to be borrowing so much money economist after economist has said if congress would only live up to its responsibility and not add so much to the deficit we know there would be it tremendous reaction in the marketplace we would not need all of that new interest to be charged by the federal government it would be brought down to a real level of reductions remember that the third or fourth largest item in any of these budgets is the interest charged on the current 1 100 billion debt all other resolutions talk about and address themselves to adding to that tremendous burden that the american people and the marketplace already carries now we believe that it is important to have this congress go on record and say that now is the time to bring down spending to such a level that the treasury does not have to go out and borrow so much in our resolution we also contemplate after october 1 1982 freezing all increases in federal payments to individuals that would be i will say to my colleagues after the 7 4percent increase that is contemplated for social security so that would not be touched i knew the members would be glad to hear that but all other payments would be frozen at the level of october 1 the overwhelming majority of our former secretaries of the treasury of this nation has saidand you read it on monday may 24 in the washington postcongress should accept its responsibility to freeze the payments to individuals beginning in october 1982 and show the american people that this government can live within its means it is imperative that the federal deficit be significantly reduced we ask that of everybody else but we always make ourselves an exception these are former secretaries of the treasury men with judgment from having to manage that tremendous deficit for long periods of time this resolutionand remember it is setting targets for spending for 1983 1984 and 1985can do that now we do not have to wait so many of my colleagues have projected time and time again and said oh well get to a balanced budget sometime in the future many many times in the chamber ever since we have had a budget process starting in 1974 committee chairman after committee chairman has come up here and said oh we should have a balanced budget but we cant do it this year and we cant do it next year well get to it a little latter the american people are asking why not now why cannot congress live within its means everybody else does approving an addon debt of 100 billion to the already enormous feder al deficit will escalate inflation and interest rates and will decrease the earning power of americas working taxpayers it will crowd out investment and production and cripple the ability of individuals and the private sector to save invest expand and develop new resources and technologies this is what stimulates our economy and creates the permanent meaningful jobs that our nation in seeking we can balance the budget in fiscal year 1983 by reining in wastefulspending and by expanding the tax base by maintaining the present economic recovery program that sparks economic growth in 1978 senator william proxmime joined me in criticizing the excessive deficits that are added to the federal budget year after year in the additional views to the joint economic committee report of 1978 he said i believe that both the presidents proposed 500 billion budget and this committees estimate of expenditures of 500 to 505 billion are too high these expenditures represent an enormous burden on american taxpayers they should be cut by a minimum of 25 billion and better yet by 35 billion in order to provide a freeze on federal outlays of about 165 billion as the distinguished financial expert henry kaufman proposed before the house committee on the budget further as one who has routinely examined the budgets of numerous government agencies as a member of the senate appropriations committee i assert without fear of contradiction that there is not a single general government function where a 5 to 7 percent cut of the funds could not result in a more efficient or less wasteful program combined with better services to the american public one can name the function and know from experience that the budget could be cut without harming the function the everincreasing deficits like those recommended by the majority constitute a trend so ominous that even many of the liberal economists are claiming that we are deficitaddicted they admit that deficits are no longer stabilizing to the economy and that rather than simply acting as an occasional stimulus deficits have occurred in greater magnitude and regularity every year the weakness of our past economic policies is that it removes the discipline of the balanced budget further politically popular but economical unproductive expenditures can be easily clothed in the virtue of deficitcreating stimulus packages it is time to place rastraints on increases in spending while many of the chairmen of various house committees have lamented about the deficit that is facing us they are at the same time recommending increases of more than 50 billion in spending apparently the philosophical difference is that they want more and more spending and more and more taxes i believe we should have less spending less taxes and more prodperity there has been some good economic indications in the news recently inflation has 1ll but disappeared as a major issue housing starts were up in february by 6 percent from january and nearly 12 percent from the october low building permits for privately owned housing units were up 14 percent in february from october indicating more future increases in housing starts the industrial production index increased 1 6 percent in february the first rise since last july a nearrecord 57 percent of the workingage population is employed the record is 59 percent income from wages and salaries rose 7 7 billion in the period from january to february the deficit for the first 5 months or this fiscal year is 2 billion less than the deficit for the same period in fiscal year 1981 and finally interest rates though still unacceptably high have taken a drop in the past year the prime rate which was over 20 percont last summer has dropped to 16 5 percent there are sigr of economic recovery the unitedstates eroniomy is entering the early stages of a recovery the consumer price index has declined for the first time in 17 years air travel which traditionally signals a change in consumer sentiment is picking up and the sales of unitedstates made autosmanaged to increase 6 1 percent for the middle 10 days of april compared with the same period last year the semiconductor industry one of the last sectors of the economy to cave in is showing signs of being about the first to rebound the time is now for this congress to take action to balance the federal budget and to place our nation on an economically sound basis i want to say that i recognize the hard work of the members of the budget committee and the many difficulties that they have faced but the appalling fact is that even after all their hard work all the difficult choices they have brought to the floor of the house a resolution which projects deficits exceeding 100 billion that means that if we are to pass this resolution a majority of members of the unitedstates house of representatives must go on record as stating that the deficits which are appropriated for this year or the next or the one after that are ok that is baloney perhaps a majority of you here can cast such a vote by supporting the committee budget i certainly am convinced that a majority of the american people would not cast any such vote i certainly will not i support the presidents program for economic recovery because the president has shown the determination to control rampant federal spending i have continued to not only support but to advocate many of his restraints proposed for government spending but coupled with that we have huge deficitsdeficits which are now apparent to us all but which also have put a hamstring on the control of federal spending if we are to have any hope of getting on a sound economic basis if we are to reduce interest rates if we are to encourage jobcreating economic growth if we are to continue to hold down inflation then i believe the present budget resolution must be substantially reshaped the figures submitted by the budget resolution simply are too high on the spending side and as a result too high on the deficih side in addition they fund this sperding with increased revenues even the revenues are too high let us not forget that this means higher and higher taxes for our constituents the projected deficits are too alarming to be permitted to stand i do not contend that these deficits can be cut without discomfort but the longer we pyt off getting on a sound ecoriomic basis the more difficult it will be for everybodythe rich and the poor alike the defense department must be aware for example that while a strong national defense is essential it cannot be maintained in the long run without a sound economy and a soundly based financial structure eqtitlement programs cannot be exempt from reductions except where we are awaiting the report of the committee which is now studying the entire scope of the social security program with the mission of preserving its solvency we must have a credible program of deficit reductionotherwise the critical element of business and consumer confidence will be lacking and a soundly based and sustainable economic recovery will not be forthcoming i have discussed this subject with many prominent and noted economists and they overwhelmingly agree that while the seeds of recovery are in the groundit does not insure a bumper crop what is needed to tend to these seeds the necessary nutrients and water and sunshine is a drop a substantial drop in interest rates these economists all agree that an elimination of the federal deficit would be just what the farmer ordered for these seeds what remains to be seen are the strength the scope and the duration of any such recovery and the determi nation of that will depend to a significant extent on what is done by the congress in acting on the budget the immediate and actual conse quences of our budgetary decisions are considerable but the psychological effects are even greater in summary i cannot support the budget submitted by the budget committee for two basic reasons one spending is too high and two the deficits are too great what i can support is the alterna tive budget resolution substitute i and several of my colleagues in the house including two members of the budget committee have introducedthe bal anced budget substityte for the past 11 ydars i have offered my balanced budget substitute resolution the need for this resolution is even more pressing this year it is imperative that the congress send a signaland a strong oneto wall street and the business community the deficits incurred by the rampant federal spending of previous years is effecting the economy of this country a lot of people lend money or have money loaned to them by others they know about deficits and they know we have got to somehow do something about it if not we will have another period of superinflation the federal reserve is going to be forced to loosen money enormously to prevent a disaster unless we have fiscal restraint here in the congress any approach that does not substan tially reduce deficits will not be credible to those that lend money interest rates will not come down if large deficits are passed by the congress people have become educated about our deficit our colleague on the senate side senator pete domenici has stated on the floor of the senate that the budget process for all its shortcomings has finally convinced people that they ought to look at the budget for a few years into the future make some projections and say something is wrong or gee things are great can you imagine how the business community would respond if we told them that we had a balanced budget in 1983 i can tell youthey would say that interest rates would go down that this is the signal that wall street has been waiting for now can you imagine what these same lenders will say it we produced a fiscal year 1983 budget with the deficits skyrocketing or even camouflaged with a social security budget shifted to the side surely interest rates would not be lowered it is now time to solve these deficit prob lems it is unrealistic to expect interest rates to come down when a 100 billion 1983 federal deficit coupled with federal offbudget borrowing will consume 80 percent of the personal savings of americans as the federal govenment borrows more and more money it leaves only a tiny residue of savings which can be used for personal and business loans that scarcity of available savings keeps interest rates high and if we do not bring interest rates down dramatically and i am talking not 2 to 4 but 6 to 8 percentage points we will face higher unemployment ever greater numbers of bankruptcies and the prospect of a return to double digit inflation as pressures mount to increase the money supply to finance federal borrowing courage is what is needed the balanced budget substitute creates hardship for some americansbut it is a fair and equitable discomfort it calls for spending restraints in all federal programs no one is exempt the american people want to go back to work our resolution will accomplish this otherwise we will have a weak economy high unemployment and further deficit spending let us bear in mind that while reducing the interest rateswe will be putting americans back to work while balancing the budget is not easyand by no means politically popular in all circlesit is necessary it is a budget that can initiate action and a budget that will show americans that we mean action and can do it in a limited timeframe judging by our current fiscal policy the congress has no intention of balancing the budget through an expanding economy todays high interest rates are wiping out all the economic gains that we could be making in response to the tax cuts that were enacted last year 1981 day by day inflation has been increasing the tax burden levied on labor and capital in so doing it is virtually guaranteeing a recession inflation is a monetary phenomenon and until we start trading tobacco leaves in the economy as our forefathers did inflation will continue to be a monetary phenomenoncaused by too much money chasing too few goods if we are trying to slow down inflation we should slow down the federal reserves printing pressesnot the productive economyand the only way feasible to do this is to eliminate deficit spending despite all the myths we must face the cold facts as to what budget deficits are and are not budget deficits represent an obligation that the government has to those citizens from whom it has borrowed it is an obligation to levy taxes on the general citizenry upon the maturity of the debt in some instances the budget deficit is financed via the federal reserve banks printing presses and this can be inflationary historically the feds role in financing the debt has been partly to blame for our current high interest rates the real problems with running budget deficits is that in most cases they are simply an expedient way of redistributing earnings from one segment of our society to another segment by forcing future generations to pay for the tab unfortunately todays generation of taxpayers is already paying part of the tab with deficits growing the federal governments obligation to increase tax rates has also been growing as a consequence our nations financial managers have been systematically turning down high risk projects with paybacks too far off in the future the bottom line has been that investment has been dropping off over a period of years and along with it productivity the only reason investment has not fallen completely out of bed is because of the tax cuts we enacted last session there can be no doubt of the need to balance the fed eral budget large deficits associated with increased federal spending either contribute to inflation or serve only to stifle investment because of the expectation of higher taxes in future years nor can there be any doubt that the drafters of our constitution ever intended to provide the congress with a free ride to spend to their hearts content by virtue of inflation and higher taxes they adopted provisions to limit the federal governmentbut adoption of the 18th amendment has lead to the emergence of powerful special interest groups in society who are competing for larger and larger shares of a growing federal spending pie the congress is in need of a new set of fiscal rules which automatically limits the growth and the size of the federal pie by constraining the power to raise taxes either through inflation or by direct vote ironically the moie the federal government has spent the less productive our economy has become congress must renavigate its fiscal course and reduce the size and scope of federal government we must put an end to the unconscionable federal intrusions into the workings of our national economy congress has the power to restrain federal government spending and balance the budget now 701 75 billion is a tremendous amount of money and let us talk about how it affects the poor according to our budget committees statistics the average poor family has spent for it on its behalf for a family of four roughly 17 000 a year by the federal government now we admit that many of those dollars do not actually reach those poor families they are chewed up by the bureaucracies in all kinds of overhead expenditures under this budget resolution that average would still be maintained in addition with the efforts that are not underway to eliminate the bureaucracy and make sure that more of those dollars genuinely go to the poor that is still a very tidy sum it is a sum to be allocated to each poor family in this country so if the attempt is made to say there is nothing in here for the poor people that just is not true the levels of expenditure in all of these functional categories that you have seen clearly are at the same level or almost the same level as 198182 and we cannot make the judgment that it will be adequate for all the poor and all the needy but it is there what we are saying is that if there is a sacrifice to be made in future increases in spending it should be evenhanded and fair and across the board that is what we recommend in this balancedbudget resolution now the spending levels as the members well know are still estab lished after we pass the budget resolution the way that that is allocated is still done by each committee the authorizing committees and in the case of revenues the committee on ways and means i would for the record just like to explain the methodology used to determine projected receipts for fiscal year 1983 the march 1982 monthly treasury statement provides us with 6month totals for federal receipts for fiscal year 1982 these figures are then extrapolated for the full year based upon previous 6month proportions thus 6 me as treasry report 6 m ful w ercent march 1979 201 597 465 940 43 27 march 1980 228 681 520 050 43 97 march 1981 260 635 599 212 43 49

determining fiscal year 1983 receipts is admittedly more hazardous using this method of computation slight variations in economic assumptions can wreak havoc upon any projectionsand they have but it is necessary to arrive at an approximate figure if for no other reason than to be able to gage spending therefore just carry the formula one step further the fiscal year 1982 total of 647 890 million represents an 8 11 percent increase over 1981 receipts this sum plus a similar 8 11 percent increase for fiscal year 1983 yields 700 434 less 2 5 percent for the thirdyear tax cut nets 682 923the projected fiscal year 1983 total to answer the obvious questions first applying an 8 11 percent increase is not unreasonable since the average annual increase over the past 3 years has been 11 65 percent significantly despite the recession 6month revenues this year are 11 11 percent higher than for the comparable period last year so the lower percentage increase of 8 11 percent is not overly optimistic second the july 1983 thirdyear increment of the tax cut package enacted last year will reduce revenues by 10 percent for the year since there remains only the final quarter of he fiscal year however the effect on receipts would be an approximate 2 5 percent reduction third the resulting net increase from fiscal year 1982 to 1983 of 5 4 percent is not incomparable to the 4 7 percent average increase for 1964 and 1965 following enactment of the kennedy tax cuts"], [0.5067301392555237, 0.5067301392555237, 0, "another in a long string of articles purporting to show wall streets newround disaffection for the administrations economic program appeared yesterday in the washington post mary mcgrory no erstwhile proponent of reaganomics herself writes that big business and recalcitrant liberals are ironically linked in their opposition to the interestfueling budget tax cut package we have heard a lot of this line recently so it was quite a surprise to receive the results of a business poll in the mall yesterday which indicates exactly the opposite the nationwide opinion survey conducted by touche ross tallied responses from 1 606 corporate leadersover 63 percent of whom were chief executive financial or operating officiera of their respective corporationsrepresenting a wide spectrum of the business comnmunity in terms of size type and geographic location when asked if they thought the next tax bill goes far enough in removing obstacles to investment and productivity more than 53 percent replied no whien asked if the new tax bill will benefit their companies over 85 percent said yes cohvetsely on whether it would hurt business 97 percent said no nearly 51 percent chose capital recovery allowances as the strongest feature of the new bill when asked what the effect of the new tax law on the economy would be 87 percent replied that it would increase investment incentive fight inflation or have some other positive psychological effect that does not sound like wailing and gnashing to me in fact it sounds pretty positive and true to form also true to farm was the day before yesterdays surge in the stock market following the decline in the prime rate to 19 percent i believe it ought to be apparent to everyone here that economic events will run their course if we simply allow them to that does not mean tampering with shortterm stopgap measures or raising taxes or revising the next tax law or artificially propping up sagging industries it means balancing the budget by trimming deficits so that interest rates can fall thereby promoting further and more longlasting economic surges this member has on previous days over the course of the past 2 weeks taken some time at the close of our session and read from a study prepared for the republican research committees economic task force budget study subcommittee this subcommittee produced a work product in the latter part of july wherein we identified 272 itqms where savings could be made in fiscal year 1982 these totaled some 52 billion we are not necessarily su~ggesting that these items should all be implemented we are saying that if the congress would assert the courage in this institution to make the cuts necessary to balance the budget these items among others certainly should be considered on previous days i have read very briefly through items relating to legislative 21 cuts judiciary 8 cuts executive office 4 cuts funds for the president 15 cuts agriculture 27 cuts commerce 8 cuts defense military 15 cuts defense civil 4 cuts education 9 cuts energy 13 cuts and health and human services 16 cuts today i would propose to read through a list of cuts for housing and urban development totaling 15 for some 3 304 249 600 and in the department of the interior 6 cuts totaling 297 557 300 the first item from hud is housing programs subsidized housing in this category we would allow 20 percent above fiscal year 1980 the proposal as it is in the present law would provide for a 51 4percent increase over the preceding year moreover the gao finds considerable overcommitment of funds due to inaccuracies in contracts we believe this is excessive and should not be tolerated if adopted this would save 1 421 941 800 in housing programs payments for operation of lowincome housing projects we would cut 10 percent from 1981 these projects have been illadvised illconceived and illmanaged we propose eliminating operation of september 24 1 981 rrentarks e 4437 the most wasteful portions of those projects and achieve savings of 215 080 000 housing programs congregate services would be eliminated funding authority for this program has already been deleted and remaining outlays should follow suit this would save if adopted 5 300 000 housing programs troubled project operation subsidy we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the additional funding of housing projects is redundant if the worst offenders would be deleted we could remove that redundancy this would save if adopted 57 399 200 housing programs lowrent housing loans and expenditures we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the current proposal is for an increase of 173 5percent increase from 1980 which is altogether in our judgment unnecessary and unreasonable if implemented this would save 51 473 400 government national mortgage association special assistance functions we would improve this by following the recommendations of the general accounting office for improving accounting procedures which if adopted for this program would save 22 700 000 onma emergency mortgage purchase assistance we would improve the servicing of multifamily mortgages and provide incentives for prompt payments this again is a recommendation of the general accounting office if adopted it is estimated to save 500 million community planning and development community development support assistance wve would cut 10 percent from proposed funding for block grants not including udag these grants have helped corporations and developers not the needy this would save 411 300 000 community planning and development community development support assistance we would eliminate udag funding to decaying inner cities which should be redeveloped under the concept of enterprise zones not out of subsidies from the public treasury if implemented and adopted this would save 500 million new community development corporation we would eliminate funding for this program because we feel it can be better financed in creation of enterprise zones if adopted this would save 37 117 000 neighborhoods voluntary associations and consumer protection interstate land sales we would eliminate this on the grounds that the federal government should never have gotten in to this area to begin with and n addition this regulatory body has expanded into the intrastate field as well which certainly is not justified if implemented this would save 300 000 fair housing and equal opportunity we would eliminate this on the grounds that it is unnecessary it should not be functioning as a separate program but rather as policy if adopted this would save 6 100 000 management and administration public assistance and income supplement we would allow a growth of 20 percent above 1980 currently proposed spending represents a 5 1 8percent increase from 1980 which we believe to be excessive if implemented this would save 19 572 800 management and administration law enforcement activities we would allow a 20percent growth above 1980 the proposed increase is unnecessary because of cutbacks in enforcement activities if implemented this would reduce spending by 1 570 400 finally for this category we would follow the recommendation of the general accounting office by correcting auditing procedures which if implemented would save 54 395 000 in the department of the interior the first item here of the six that are proposed departmentwide we would correct auditing procedures recommended by the general accounting office which if implemented would reduce spending for this category by 59 510 000 land and water resources elm range improvement we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by limiting further land acquisition if implemented this would save 1 350 000 land and water resources blm resource management we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by restricting regulation and management if implemented this would reduce spending by 24 482 500 land and water resources elm miscellaneous permanent appropriation general purpose fiscal assistance we would allow 20percent growth above what was spent in 1980 the current proposal allows a 74 4percent increase from 1980 which we perceive as unwarranted this if adopted would save 201 515 600 land and water resources water and power resource service general administration we would allow 20percent above 1980 the proposed 50 1percent increase from 1980 is in our judgment excessive and should not be tolerated this if implemented would reduce spending in fiscal year 1982 by 8 899 200 land and water resources office of water policy salaries and expenses we would eliminate this new agency on the grounds that it is not needed there is little justification for its existence in our opinion this if implemented would reduce spending by 1 800 000 to sum up this category of the department of interior these six items would result in spending 297 557 300 less in fiscal year 1982 for the department of housing and urban development the 15 items total 3 304 249 600 some members in this chamber may from time to time ask the question if it is so simple why do we not do it that is why do we not balance the budget why do we not assert the necessary independence to bring the discipline to bear to match the outgowith the income and remove one of the great obstacles to economic recovery of this country the answer to that question is puzzling but it is probably more political than anything else there is a drum beat that runs through these chambers which says that if the members exhibit the courage to cut the spending this will1 aggravate those people and organizations adversely affected and these same special interests who are cut down or cut off will retaliate against the offending members in the voting booth that philosophy has been driving this institution for almost a generation it still is the controlling philosophy in this chamber then you may ask what hope is there for the people of this country if we who have the stewardship of raising taxes and voting spending do not have the courage to match the outgo with the income i think one constructive way is to demonstrate that we can balance the budget of this nation in fiscal year 1982 while at the same time providing for the recognized needs of the downtrodden the poor the handicapped and the deprived in our society because when you analyze these items that i have been reading i challenge members to stand up and honestly say that we cannot do that because if we adopted this or that item we would be working against the genuine interests of the poor the downtrodden the handicapped and the deprived those who do not have the ability to fend for themselves i say to the members here look at these items carefully we have prepared them in all sincerity we as an institution cannot go on year after year spending more money then we take in in this fiscal year which will close in less than a week we will have probably gone into debt roughly 90 billion in the last 5 years we have added to our national debt over 300 billion notwithstanding the election of november 1980 the spending of the congress of the united states is today out of control the members of this institution do not have the discipline at least as they have exhibited it up to now to match the outgo with the income i think the constructive thing for us to do is to demonstrate with a work product of this type that we can cut spending we can cut our bureaucracy we can cut out waste fraud and abuse i think it is reasonable to undertake this effort in a bipartisan way and try to bring some fiscal sanity into the affairs of this nation"], [0.506209671497345, 0.506209671497345, 0, "i cannot think of anything that would be more helpful to older americans today than to demystify the issue of social security minimum benefits the administration and members of the house of representatives and the senate decided to eliminate the minimum benefit in the budget reconciliation process this change was not undertaken without considerable research about its potential effect on older citizens removal of the minimum benefit was recommended precisely because it is an unearned benefita welfare type of income supplement that a recipient is not entitled to from his or her payroll tax contributions maintaining these unearned minimum benefits will cost 7 billionputting unnecessary pressure on the already stresseoi trust funds it is important here to recognize that there are two different kinds of minimum social security beneficiaries one group of beneficiaries has worked for years under social security but at low wages the formula that is used to determine their benefits is purposefully weighted so that they can receive more than they actually should based on their payroll tax contributions these longterm lowwage earners receive benefits that are higher so that they can have a better standard of living after retirement these people who have worked at least 19 years under the system are completely protected as they should be from any benefit changes there is a second group of persons who receive a minimum benefit and who are the subject of current discussion this group has as a rule worked for a short time under social security at high wages based on total lifetime earnings the average individual receiving this minimum benefit could have paid less than 355 in social security payroll taxes over their lifetime and receive a benefit of 2 122 in 1982 this amount would also be increased annually to reflect changes in the cpi in certain instances a couple could receive at least 3 183 in 1982 by paying as little as 3 in payroll taxes over their entire working lifetime it has been found that on the average a husband and wife getting an initial minimum benefit in 1982 would be paid more than 100 000 during their retirement lifetime from the social security trust funds for this average couple that would be about 300 times what they paid into the system these cannot be considered earned benefits now it is important that we are all clear about those that will be affected by the change there are presently 3 million persons receiving the minimum benefit research undertaken byf the general accounting office shows that only 17 percent of the minimum benefit recipients are truly needy and that 74 percent do not depend primarily on social security for retirement income the general accounting office also estimates that 450 000 minimum beneficiaries are already receiving federal pensions averaging 16 000 annually in addition 50 000 have retired spouses who are estimated to receive an average of 18 500 in federal pensions and 300 000 have spouses who are earning an average 21 100 this accounts for 800 000 of the 3 million current minimum benefit recipients another 1 2 million are only technical minimum beneficiaries actually these individuals received more than the minimum benefit because they are entitled to dual benefitstheir total benefit payment is based not only on their own low earnings but on the earnings and social security taxes of their spouse their total benefit would be unaffected by elimination of the minimum benefit also in this group are 200 000 persons who have earned benefits that are equal to the minimum benefit because earned benefits would not be affected these people would not lose any benefits of those receiving the minimum benefit 500 000 are also receiving supplemental security income which is adjusted for receipt of other income therefore those people who would lose the social security minimum benefit would have that same amount replaced under the ssi program an important step was taken to eliminate possible hardships for many of the needy persons receiving social security minimum benefits under the present law one is not eligible for ssi unless he or she is 65 blind or disabled under our new proposal when the minimum benefit is eliminated people who are between the ages of 60 and 64 will be considered eligible for benefits under ssi if they meet other eligibility requirements i think it is particularly important to understand all these facts in light of the charade undertaken by the democrats in the house of representatives today the democrats introduced a resolution that strongly urges that the necessary steps be taken to insure that social security benefits are nor reduced for those currently receiving them they did this knowing that this resolution is not binding and has no force to bring about any change it was used in a partisan effort to improve the popularity of the democratic party statements were continually made that 3 million needy older persons would be hurt by the elimination of the minimum benefit even though this is clearly not the case beside the availability of ssi needy individuals will also be eligible for other federal programs such as food stamps and medicaid benefits the administration and the republican leadership of the house did not want to make this important effort to improve the system an emotional and partisan issue they did not want to be ~placed in a negative role for their attempts to strengthen the system for the wage earners to diffuse this growing bitterness most republicans including myself will vote with the democrats in support of the resolution in closing because of what i have just said i will fully understand the proposal to eliminate the minimum july 21 1 981 co benefit because it is not accomplishing the purpose for which it was originally intended most of the people who receive it were not the low wage earners for whom it was developed moreover many beneficiaries receive adequate income from other sources i believe that it is in the broader national interest to stabilize the system and keep it viable for current and future beneficiaries in doing so we must continue to honor our 46yearold contract wvith the american worker without jeopardizing senior citizens who depend on social security as their primary means of support if high unemployment and high inflation continue to have a negative impact on the social security system we must attempt to correct the deficits by phasing in changes over a long enough transitional period to allow future retirees time to

congress make clear that the american people stand united behind great britain in the tragic struggle developing over the falkland islands we all hoped that armed conflict could be avoided secretary haigs skillful and energetic effort to facilitate a peaceful settlement is to be commended that effort probably required a certain degree of evenhandedness now that argentine intransigence has made it clear that such an approach will not work the administrations decision to come out in full diplomatic support of britain is entirely appropriate the views of a distinguished member of the other body notwithstanding the notion that the united states had any real choice but to back great britain in this dispute is danger ously superficial regardless of the validity of competing claims of sovereignty argentina by seizing the islands by force has marked itself as the clear aggressor in this case the united states had no choice but to make it absolutely clear that the use of force to solve international territorial disputes will not be tolerated there are other profoundly important reasons for offering full diplomatic support to great britain in terms of right and wrong american foreign policy will seldom go aqtray if it is premised on support for the principle of nelfdetermination as john stuart mill once said one hardly knows what any division of the human race should be free to do if not to determine with which of the various collective bodies they choose to associate at issue in the falklands is not decolonialism bzut recolonialism the principle at stake is whether small numbers of people in small places in the world can determine their own destiny argentinas claims to sovereignty over the falklands are historical in nature dating most recently to 1833 these claims thus predate the entry of california to the union and carry dubious legal validity today the main test of international law to be applied on the sovereignty issue is not that of historicism but that of selfdeterminaticn it is the british who have assured the 1 800 people of the islands that through a plebiscite they may determine their own destiny it is the argentine military junta which through the use of force is denying this prospect finally strict considerations of national interest dictate that we support britain in this struggle solidarity in the western hemisphere is important but in a strategic sense it cannot be compared to the vital need for solidarity with the most steadfast member of nato our premier security alliance the aforementioned member of the other body in casting the sole vote against a resolution similar to the one we are now considering asserted that we have a vital need for the support of the argentine junta in preventing the spread of communist influence in central america this is hogwash that we must rely in any significant way upon military dictatorships of the type now in power in argentina to help preserve democracy in el salvador or elsewhere shows the bankruptcy of our policy in central america too often that policy seems to be premised upon the profoundly mistaken notion that it is possible to fight communist totalitarianism with equally despotic regimes of another stripe it would be tragic if a dispute in a remote corner of the south atlantic provoked by a corrupt regime with flagging domestic popularity should lead to severe strains in our most crucial collective security system embracing the north atlantic the longstanding bonds of mutual support that linked us in world war i and world war ii with britain simply cannot be jeopardized for a military government like that in power in argentina for all of these reasons it is profoundly important that we approve this resolution demonstrating solidarity with great britain the sanctions against argentina announced by the administration last friday coupled with offers of materiel support to britain should make it clear to argentinas leaders that rbfusal to withdraw their invasion forces from the falklands is a policy that will lead only to international isolation and bloodshed if the argentines nonetheless persist in their intransigence it may be necessary to consider going beyond the measures announced to date and to join great britain and her european and commonwealth allies by curtailing argentine exports to the united states economic sanctions are an imperfect response to political problems but solidarity with our allies may demand no less of us if this crisis continues if we cannot support our closest ally with minimal economic sanctions on an issue in which international law is so profoundly on britains side our european allies will inevitably ask whether we can be depended upon in a nato security context we all hope that further bloodshed can be averted if argentina persists in its present course however great britain deserves our full diplomatic support as called for in the resolution for reasons of right reasons of alliance and reasons of heritage we must be a united states behind a united kingdom finally issues of right and judgment aside there are certain lessons for our government and the world community in this conflict first much as it may be desirable it is not always possible to fence sit on important issues of the day even when choosing sides a nowin proposition in this case the prides and prestige of leaders in two governments are at stake and it is not inconceivable that after the initial outpouring of patriotic concerns the preparations to use force on both sides will inevitably lead to actions that may in the final measure prove to be liabilities for both governments internal support for both governments may be jeopardized and that two governments friendly to the united statesalbeit one a democracy and one a rightist military dictatorshipmay fall whether or not this occurs the liabilities of the falklands crisis to america are very great especially as they relate to our hemispheric relations it cannot be stressed enough that our peculiarly american heritage and relations with our neighbors to the south will and are being stretched to a profound degree because of our carefully considered tilt to great britain neverthless a probritish stance is the only appropriate position for america to take much as we might have preferred not to take a stand we have no choice except to do so as dante wrote the hottest circles of hell are reserved for those who in a time of imoral crisis maintain their neutrality second despite our preception that britains international legal position is sound there are concerns in america about the appropriateness of levels of response clearly there has seldom been a more unnecessary war and friends of britain and argentina urge today those tactics of restraint which hold the greatest prospect for a negotiated settlement here the oftquoted advice of the british military strategist liddell hart is relevant keep strong if possible in any case keep cool have unlimited patience never corner an opponent and always assist him to save his face put yourself in his shoesso as to see things through his eyes avoid selfrighteousness like the devilnothing is so selfblinding third there are lessons for the united states and britain about a foreign policy disproportionately premised on arms sales ironically our closest ally is being opposed by weapons systems supplied to the argentine military by ourselves and by the british perhaps the world would be a safer place if foreign aid programs were more oriented to economic than arms assistance fourth the conflict over the falklands underlines the lack of adequate institutions available for conflict resolution in the world the u n in new york and the international court of justice in the hague would appear to be the logical places where differences between these two great countries should be brought yet neither of these institutions were prepared to act immediatelypartly because there was not a joint britishargentine desire to submit to neutral thirdparty arbitration partly because a number of countries in the world including the united states have been conducting a foreign policy having the effect of undercutting rather than building up respect for international institutions it is ironic that today we want the u n to play a greater role in this truly important dispute involving questions of international law and rights of the seas but that just last week the united states culminated a year and a half of negative dillomacy by voting no on a law of the sea treaty which would have bolstered international law on twothirds of the earths surface including the south atlantic it is also ironic thait while we are turning more toward unilateral diplomacy we are seeking in this crisis international interventions for peace somehow the world has to understand that beyond the immediacy of this dispute is the problem it underlines how to resolve conflicts without resort to force clearly new policies of all the great and lester powers of the world are demanded"], [0.5057815909385681, 0.5057815909385681, 0, "in title xiv of the 1977 and 1981 farm bills the congress sought to halt decades of decline in federal funding and emphasis on research and education in the food and agricultural sciences it is no secret why america leads the world in the production of food fiber and forest products the effort to put our country in that leadership role began as far back as 1862 when our government entered into a longstanding commitment to endorse and support public expenditures at state landgrant colleges and universities for agricultural research and education programs for the extension of technical knowledge from the science laboratories to the user farmers and ranchers of this nation this effort also included as well programs that enhanced the living conditions and standards for farm and rural people and people throughout our country this commitment reached its climax in 1939 when approximately 39 percent of all federal research and development funds were allocated to agricultural research and education unfortunately by 1975 funds for agricultural research and education had sunk to approximately 2 percent of the federal r d budget fortunately for the american farmer and consumer these earlier efforts paid such rich dividends that our nation gained the capability to produce a cornucopia of food fiber and forest products far outstripping the capabilities of our competitors moreover our agriculture industry with only about 3 percent of the nations labor force as farmers produces such an abundance of food and fvber that our own people enjoy the best quality diet purchased with a smaller percent of disposable income of any people in the world in the history of man this remarkable feat has been made possible through extensive technological developments adopted by our farm producers and processors these developments and adoptions have as their basis the research and educational institutions our landgrant colleges and the 1890 institutions across the nation agriculture is one bright spot for america in the world marketplace while our nation is blessed with natural resources necessary for extensive agricultural production as well as a favorable climate in much of the nation the might and importance of the industry are dependent on other factors primarily past technological development we must continue to develop new technology if we are to maintain our world market position two decades ago most americans held the notion that products made in japan were cheap handmade trinkets with little durability what a change has taken placel where in the world will similar changes take place to enable farm producers to outcompete american producers only if we maintain a commitment to those factors that have enabled the american agricultural industry to grow in magnitude and importance will we maintain our ability to sell significant amounts of our production to the world and pay for the vast qualities of raw products we must import from other nations to fuel and feed our own industries and provide jobs for american labor and only by selling to the world market can we share in meeting the needs of hungry undernourished people of the world it is known that the worldwide demand for food and fiber will increase throughout tile rest of this century it is anticipated that people of the world will seek a better quality diet which will include more animal products in other areas of the world there have been examples of dramatic improvements in agricultural production india long riddled with famine is now producing enough wheat to meet most of its domestic needs this is a direct result of unitedstates wheat research advanced by normand borlaug at cimmyt in mexico and subsequently adapted in india similarly rice production in asia has significantly increased as a result of research at the international rice research institute in the philippines we in this nation have experienced approximatey a twofold increase in crop yields since 1940 largely a result of technology initiated over a century ago we know that there are substantial dividends for investments in technological developments in tuture agricultural production some have said that the importance of agriculture is equal to if not greater than that of our national defense system in regards to maintaining a strong competitive agriculture the soviet union and peoples republic of china are placing the highest priority on food production research with emphasis not only on output but on stable production from year to year we feel that the future of america can be no better than the future of the agricultural industry it is within the national interest to provide public support for agricultural research and education while we know there will be demand for farm products we should not take for granted the possibility that american agriculture will fill that demand without competition in most recent years productivity on american farms has been plateauing some of the reasons for this plateauing are soil erosion reduced soil organic matter soil compaction chemical residues more less productive land in production increased pressure on prime land for nonfarm uses fewer options for water fertilizer and pesticides increased regulatory constraints and decreased support for agricultural research and extension in real dollars this plateauing is not the result of not having any remaining potential to realize from continued research and education while approximately half of the agricultural reseach in the united states is funded with private funds we do not feel the nation should rely more heavily on this funding source furthermore many necessary projects would never be undertaken were we to rely on private initiative funding of food and agricultural research involves the expense of having things ready to go when research is required being prepared demands maintenance and replacement of research tools flocks herds barns feed milking parlors machinery field stations land orchards crops irrigation equipment and greenhouses we see a need for consistent formula funding of the hatch act as these funds are the basis for maintaining research systems benefits to farmers from research which reduces the cost of producing food fiber and forest products spill across county and state lines when we develop improved technology early acceptors and implementors benefit but in the long run the true benefactor is the american consumer research benefits everyone in the supermarkets therefore it is appropriate to maintain significant federal funding federal funds provide an element of federal influence this influence is in the form of coordination of efforts and results in minimizing duplications federal involvement also provides for upward and outward movement of information the usda science and education agenciesars csrs and extensionare examples of effective federal agencies further csrs and extension which manage federal state partnership research and education programs are federal agencies with relatively limited staffs that provide valuable coordination points for these programs the next generation of researchers and teachers and demonstrators

nonpolluting agriculture is the only major industry that directly depends on solar energy we farm the sun plants are literally biological sun traps and we ought to invest more of our resources to learn more about this magical process we recognize and agree with the need to reduce government spending we also recognize the dramatic returns available from investments in agricultural research and education we are convinced that the commitment should be increased and that the federal partner must participate in the increases we hope that the future will have increases even more extensive than those proposed by the administration in this years budget i am proud to report that the president and the secretary of agriculture are both in full support of the need for maintaining our leadership role in american agriculture now and into the future in this regard is is important to note that the only element of the fiscal year 1983 agriculture budget that received an increase was the research and education program moreover i havd been informed by secretary block himself that an outstanding scientist and leader in american agriculture for the position of assistant secretary of agriculture for research and education has been recommended to the president for nomination to the senate for confirmation further committing this administration to a strong agricultural research and education

inspect various nuclear power and waste facilities this tour involved 5 days in japan and 5 days in taiwan while the primary purpose of this visit especially in japan was to learn about the status of the commercial use of nuclear power in these foreign countries i also used the occasion to talk with the officials of these governments about other matters of foreign and domestic policy the overwhelming impression i have of these countries is their successful economic growth and the purposeful linkage of that objective with developing independent sources of energy both countries have expanded their economies using the free enterprise system as much as possible and keeping state planning restrictions to a minimum what this means for the stability of their currencies unemployment rates and the continued improvement in the standard of living for the japanese and the free chinese people i will defer to the economists for detailed analyses but there is no doubt that in general both countries are in very good shape economically despite having small land masses and very few natural resources of their own although there are many factors contributing to the success stories of these two allies of the united states as you know my responsibilities on the energy and commerce committee would cause me to look carefully at their energy policies having done so i believe that these senergy policieskeyed tp making japan and taiwan independent of the opec oil cartelconstitute a major reason for the current good health of the japanese and the free chinese the time spent in japan was devoted to examining the countrys nuclear power developments japan presently has 22 nuclear powerplants in operation~ with an installed capacity of 15 000 mwe thereby making it the second largest nuclear power producer in the world nuclear pow~er supplies approximately 13 percent of japans total electriclty and accounts for about 4 percent of its total energy supply by 1990 jarqns goal is to almost triple the percentage of nuclear power in its energy mix as in other countries there jr some opposition to nuclear projects especially from local populations ~ proposed nuclear sites nevertheless i believe there are three fundamental reasons why japan will move forward with its nuclear programs first there is a strong consensus in the government and among the japanese people in favor of nuclear power because of its critical linkage to their domestic economy and international trade second the nuclear industry iswellstaffed and wellfinanced it is better integrated with the other japanese economic sectorsbanks universities and governmentthan any other japanese energy producer the japan atomic industrial forum is made up of a large cross section of japans economic interests going fer beyond reactor manufacturers accordingly one can expect an expanded public relations campaign designed to educate the public to the positive a~pects and beniefits of nuclear power and third nuclear power represents the closest energyindependent source that japan can attain toward this end japan has a vigorous research and development program in all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle beginning with exploration for uranium through waste disposal the principal japanese organization for undertaking these programs is the power reactor nuclear fuel develormant corp pnc pnc is actively engaged in reprocessing spent nuclear fuel at its tokalmura facility which i visited close to a hundred tons of spent fuel have been reprocessed at this faciity moreover at the same site a plutonium fuel fabrication plant is in operation pnc also has responsibility for the design construction and operation of japans joyo fastbreeder research reactor plans are underway for construction of the 300mwe monju fast breeder prototype reactor and a target date for operation has been set for december 1987 the total cost of construction will be approximately 400 billion yen 200 million twenty percent of the total cost80 billionwill be borne by the private sector itaiwan has an equally if not more ambitious nuclear program for the future although due to the difference in industrialization with japan it of course has far fewer nuclear powerplants now in operation nevertheless by the end of this century the goal of the free chinese is to have about half of their electricity emanating from nuclear power their existing powerplauts have been built by general electric and westinghouse however for the first time the taiwan power co is now seriously considering purchasing a system hid by a company other than one from the united states the company in question is a french one in answer to my inquiries about this possible change in what has heretofore been an exclusively buy american policy on nuclear matters i was given the following answer recent uncertainties about the consistency and rellability of unitedstates commercial nuclear power export policies i my visit to taiwan was more general in nature than in japan so that the itinerary included more than just nuclear matters as a result i was able to talk to president chiang chifigkuo premier sunyun suan and several of the cabinet secretaries about developments in their areas of responsibility of interest to the united states along with inspecting one of their nuclear powerplants in the republic of china i had the unique opportunity to spend a day on the island of quemoy where the state of military readiness is indeed something to see i also met with representatives of the american institute in taiwan the american soybean association and the american chamber of commerce to learn more about current conditions in taiwan especially following the unitedstates derecognition decision in 1978 as you know a legislative factfinding trip is more important for what one learns than for what one sees while i saw some new thingssince i had never been to the orient befortamong other things what i learned in japan and taiwan that has particular significance for current unitedstates export and energy policies was twofold first in order to get out from under the thumb of the opec oil cartel both countries are offsetting oil as an energy source with nuclear power and second not only are we losing business for our people because of the inflexible nuclear nonprolif eration act of 1978 but more importantly we are losing control over the sensitive materialplutoniumwhich becomes more accessible with the development of advanced nuclear technologies around the world both japan and taiwan would rather work with united states on constructing nuclear reactors purchasing enriched uranium reprocessing the spent fuel safeguarding the sensitive material and managing the wastes involved but for reasons of energy independence they will goelsewhere if rigid unitedstates policies force them elsewhere with particular reference to japan i would urge my colleagues in the house to read the risen

described as the magnificent seven i guess we would have to say that really there is maybe a magnificent six with one alsoran and that is the member who is speaking now i was genuinely moved by all the remarks that have been made about our distinguished colleagues and i think the thipg that impresses me the most is the sincerity with which these presentations were made by each and every one of the members we are told that a friend is one who comes to you when all others leave that is particularly significant for all those who have gone through a number of elections and then find themselves on the losing side of an election that is in itself a test of the caliber and character of an individual i would also suggest to those who are leaving as i have tried to convey to my friends something that i believe has relevance to those of us who are departing and that is that a real happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery when he has to take a detour so i am going to be presenting my remarks concerning all the distinguished californians with whom i have served and i would like to offer a few comments about at least the three members who are here on the floor i am pleased to come to the well and pay this tribute to my fellow californian wayne grisham who will be leaving the congress at the end of his present term we can ill afford to lose members with the ability dedication and unlimited potential of my good friend wayne grisham he is leaving behind an impressive record of service to our state and this nation and in that respect he has only continued the pattern he set before coming to the nations capitol in fact wayne onisham left one highly distinguished career in the city government and business community of la mirada to start another one in washington in he wasted no time putting to work his strong background of experience in both local government and the private sector in the relatively short span of 4 years wayne has played a very active and effective legislative role in congress it has been my good fortune to have worked closely with wayne on the public works and transportation committee he has been a particularly valuable member of our aviation and water resources subcommittees having served as a fighter pilot in world war ii wayne has had a special interest in aviation his experience and expertise in this area have enabled him to make an important contribution to the cause of a safe and efficient airport and airway system wayne brought to the public works and transportation committee and to the post office and civil service committee on which he has also served a firsthand knowledge of public works transportation and other needs facing the cities and towns of america that background also served him well as a member of the suburban caucus and the travel and tourism caucus with his extensive knowledge of local transportation needs it therefore was only natural that wayne should play a key congressional role in important transportation projects such as the century freeway project which provides for the construction of a roadway through the very heart of los angeles county eventually to connect the east and west sides wayne grishams world war ii experience which included being shot down over germany and becoming a prisoner of war undoubtedly helped shape his great appreciation for and commitment to a strong national defense and he has worked tirelessly and effectively to that end throughout his service in the house wayne has also built a strong record in support of fiscal responsibility in government a balanced budget lower taxes less government intervention and a reduction in both government spending and excessive regulation he has pursued his concern for reducing government regulation as a very active member of the regulatory reform task force those of us who have had the opportunity to serve with wayne grisham have been most fortunate he has been one of our most dedicated and hardworking members and i shall miss working closely with him in committee and in this chamber i am pleased to tribute to my good fellow california colleague barry goldwater jr who will be ending his congressional service at the close of the 97th congress our state and the nation is losing a highly effective public servant in barry goldwater jr and certainly the 98th congress will miss his tremendous contributions having worked closely for the past 14 years with him on matters affecting california and the nation i know very well the void his departure will leave in this chamber bairy goldwater jr has made an enormous impact on the affairs of government since coming to congress in 1969 his california constituents wisely returned him to washington for seven consecutive terms and as a result we in this chamber have had the good fortune to enjoy barrys special talents and coriderable legislative experience he has been a valuable member of the minority leadership of both the public works and transportation and science and technology committees on the latter he serves as the ranking republican of the transportation aviation and materials subcommittee and he is a member of the energy research and pruduction subcommittee it has been a special pleasure for me to have served with barry on the public works and transportation committee he has served on both our aviation and investigations and oversight subcommittees his leadership during this congress as the ranking minority member of the investigations and oversight subcommittee has enabled that subcommittee under the able chairmanship of elliott levitas to meet its mandate to provide oversight of the important programs under our committees jurisdiction certainly in the field of aviation an area in which he and i share a common interest barry goldwater jr has had few equals his special insight into the problems needs and potential of aviation particularly general aviation and his vast legislative experience in this area have proven invaluable to the development of sound legislation to insure the growth of a healthy national airport and airway system of course barrys record of accomplishment ranges far beyond the scope of public works and transportation he has been one of our most outspoken members and particularly so in assessing the proper roles of the federal government he has led the fight to limit the growth and size of government to end unfair government competition with the private sector and to protect the rights of states against encroachment from the federal government he has also applied his expertise as a member of the energy research and production subcommittee to the vital search for workable solutions to our nations energy problems all americans can be thankful for the successful efforts of barry goldwater jr in guiding his landmark 1974 right to privacy act into public law as a result private citizens now have access to government files about them whenever barry has attacked an issue he has done so with his full energies dedication and tenacity and far more often than not he has been highly successful in his efforts his efforts have been guided always by what he considered in the best interest of his constituents and the nation his presence and his leadership will be missed in our california delegation and in the congress and i personally will miss his

most proud of his record of congressional actions which includes being the only member of the minority party to have a record of 24 amendments passed and to have been appointed as chairman of the house task force on american prisoners and missing in southeast asia we have all known bob as an individual who has worked above and beyond the call of duty on issues that are consistant with the ideals for which he stood and i am proud to have had the opportunity to list bob as one of the most esteemed members of the california delegation and a special friend bob dornan will be remembered as the champion of such mutually shared concerns as returning our vietnam pow mias the prolife movement restoring the production of the b1 bomber and stopping the sale of american high technology items to the soviet bloc countries many of these causes had been a focal point of interest to bou long before the initiation of his congressional career many arericans became acquainted with bob when he was a tv news anchorman during the vietnam era as a war correspondent bob aired 14 air combat stories consequently bobs interest in the pow mia movement had been an ongoing concern for the past 17 years bob had served in the unitedstates air force for 5 years as a fighter pilot then 18 years in the air force reserve during this time he had personally flown over 17 highperformance united states and foreign fighters boas background represents a significant expertise factor which contributed to the solving of difficult legislative issues regarding our military and civilian aircraft systems and the questions of selling american technological systems to foreign governments bob is a leader who has successfully mastered the rare combination of technological competence and humanitarian concerns since the 1960s boa has been active in civil rights issues and he has achieved recognition for his work in this area by being the recipient of several awards which include the brandeis award the cardinal mindzenty award the tom dooley award the hungarian freedom fighters award and numerous community awards for work against drug abuse it was my privilege and honor to have had the opportunity to work with boa dornan these past 6 years boa has been a shining example of the high principles and standards which is the cornerstone tradition set forth by our founding fathers to which we all strive as members of this esteemed body of congress above all bob is a gentleman in the world of our great statesmen and most significantly a loyal and devoted husband to his lovely most patient and

rousselot during our many years in congress john has become known for his consistent efforts to fight excess government spending cut taxes and balance the federal budget john was one of the original supply side economic supporters very early he recognized that excessive federal taxes destroy initiative for individuals encouraging consumption rather than savings he has been honored with countless awards including the guardian of small business award watchdog of the treasury and even an emmy award for the lomaxrousselot debate on kttv television it is with sincere and profound sadness that i realize john rousselot will not be returning for the 98th congress those of us who have observed john closely realize he is a real dynamo and his attention to detail on the floor helps keep the house action honest he has extraordinary follow through if john gave you a commitment his word was his bond our colleague has a very distinguished record in the ways and means committee and the members will be deprived of his talents john has the ability to retain an inordinate amount of information pay close attention to detail and still he always finds the time for his colleagues and his constituency the congress will long remember the extraordinary legislative contributions joun has made to the american people i want to take this opportunity to express my sincere and heartfelt thanks to john his lovely wife yvonne and his three lovely children as a result of johns untiring and dedicated service he has left his footprints on this legislative body the great state of california and the united states of america as a spiritual and religious man i believe that god doesnt close one door without opening another i hope that the door s that open for john and his family will have a happy and rewarding future clan burgener has left his mark on the record of congress and most importantly in the minds of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who like myself were so privileged to serve with this outstanding legislator clair burgener began his public service on the san diego city council and the state legislature where he gained a reputation for performance and followthrough this

a tough job to be done and you want the job done wellcall on clain burgener and he will see it through while i served as dean of the california republican delegation clair burgener took on a very special assignment as our representative on the allimportant committee on committees his sense of fairness and very constructive approach afforded us with results that far exceeded our expectations to say that he has earned our deepest admiration and respect is at best an understatement his position as secretary of the house republican conference is further testimony to this fact clair burgener has a richness of character that has afforded him unique access to the personalities particpating in the political process which has proved to be instrumental in his service as a key member on the house appropriations committee in that capacity clair will leave a legacy of energy and water projects such as santa margarita and the special initiatives in addressing reclamation reform which will stand forever as living monuments to the service of this very distinguished and congenial gentleman from southern california with all of these responsibilities and commitments clair burgener always made time to address our shared concerns for the handicapped and retarded which gained him recognition with a national constituency all of his qualities are based on a lifelong adherence to the christian ethicqualities which will leave a deep impression on me as i reflect back on our relationship clam and his lovely wife marvia both radiate the kind of goodness that makes them the kind of people you are very comfortable to be around while most of us have committed the golden rule to memory clair and marvia have committed it to their lives we of the california delegation and yours truly are proud

than worth the effort the question however is whether the general assembly is worthy of the task whether the general assembly is even attemptine to fulfill the mandate set down decades ago is in doubt the united nations should clearly understand the united states is wedded to the concepts upon which the united nations was founded it is not wedded to all bodies in the institution"],

respected colleague who passed away on apr1 12 at the far too early age of 67 his sudden passing was a severe blow to this body and i am sure i1 speak for all of us present today when i say that he will be missed i have served in washington for a great many yearsand can recall few colleagues who were as gifted as tenny among his many gifts which we will all remember i think the two i will remember most were his ability to hold an audience spellbound with his voice andhis great love of all people two attributes which went hand in hand as an orator humorist and inspirational speaker few could touch him yet his words touched so many every speech had a purpose for our dear friend every sentence had a message to coin a phrase when tenny spoke everyone listened i have said that he was fond of all people but that was only part of the story he cared for them as well whether they were in his district or in a prisoner of war camp somewhere in southeast asia he fought hard for the aged handicapped disadvantaged and underprivileged of our nation as a member of congress he epitomized what a public servant should be a man who always believed that the needs of the general public should never play second fiddle to the desires of a special few to us he was a colleague a man we enjoyed working with on the floor or in committee but to a special few his staff he was much more than just a congressman he was the father of a very close family a family which loved him as well as loved by him i have been told he never was too busy to help out in a crisis whether it pertained to office or personal matters the lessons they learned from him and the love shared will remain in their hearts and minds forever to his family and staff i extend my sincere condolence on their loss a loss shared by a nation which appreciates all that he tried to accomplish for it in this time of sadness they surely must be sustained by the memory of his lifetime and numerous achievements as well as by the respect in which his memory is held by those fortunate to have known him"], [2.2411346435546875e-05, 0.49997758865356445, 0, "there has been one clear loser in the budget debates this yearnot the republicans or the democrats or the boll weevils or the yellow jackets or any of the other types that live on capitol hill the real loser has been congress itselfand perhaps a bit of the american spirit congress made a national spectacle of itself debating for days last month and finally approving not one of the eight bills offered our colleagues in the other body did only marginally better approving a bill that provides for big increases in both real spending and taxes while maintaining a big budget deficit i have been home running in a statewide primary and i can tell you what i heard i heard folks at home saying it is business as usual here in washington with congress either paralyzed into inaction or approving resolutions of dubious fiscal responsibility congress simply appears to be unwilling to offend any of the special interest groups who so effectively court votes of its members congress loss is the nations loss and it has created a voting apathy evident in the primary elections earlier this weekthe result of cynicism about governments willingness to do the right and necessary things last year congress put on the books an economic recovery program that is our only hope to reverse years of inflation economic stagnation declining real wages and falling employment opportunities we must not undo the great good we did last year by succumbing in an election year to short term political expediency we must approve a budget that keeps the major elements of last years tax cuts in place at the same time we must provide a realistic plan for reducing budget deficits by cutting unproductive federal spending in my opinion the latta resolution comes closer to achieving that objective than either the jones alternative before the house or the resolution approved in the senate we cannot achieve economic recovery until we approve a budget that tells the financial markets that we mean business about ending inflation without restoring the punitive taxes that have so grievously reduced capital formation in our nation we must act and we must act now at the same time we cannot expect miracles overnight rome was not built in a day and america cannot be rebuilt in one either our nation has been building our present economic problems for at last a decade the presidents program will take time to work but there are signs that recovery is beginningthe leading economic indicators are improving the cost of living and underlying rate of inflation are falling car sales are rising and interest rate reductions are awaiting our action the presidents program is more than a plan to end the recession that began before he took office it is a plan to revitalize the american economy for decades to come although it is not yet 1984 this budget debate has taken place in an orwellian dream world of double speak we are throwing around numbers on the deficit and revenues and spending that have no realistic basis in fact for example we are speaking of tax increases without even specifying what these increases are it is time for us to get our act together to tell both the financial markets and the people that we mean to carry out the only economic program that has a chance to reverse years of high inflation high unemployment and economic stagnation a vote for the latta resolution is an important step toward reaffirming our only hope the presidents program for economic recovery"], [3.349781036376953e-05, 0.49996650218963623, 1, "i too rise in support of h r 5879 as a representative from the state most severely impacted by refugee populations this measure is of particular importance to me there are now about 600 000 indochinese refugees in the united states and over onethird of them reside in california los angeles county alone has more refugees than the state with the second highest refugee population texas in addition seven counties in california have more refugees than 40 states combined to say that this influx with its attendant high dependency rates has placed strains upon the public health education and welfare systems of callfornia would be an understatement because we have been pushed to the limits of our capabilities we need a policy that takes into consideration more carefully the domestic impacts of federal decisions to admit refugees i believe that h r 5879 is a constructive step in establishing such a policy the bill requires periodic consultations between voluntary agencies and state and local governments prior to the arrival of refugees it directs the office of refugee resettlement to develop placement strategies that avoid new resettlements in already impacted areas and it requires an extensive study on the advisability and feasibility of establishing an impact aid program during full committee markup i offered an amendment to abolish the discretionary authority of the federal government to provide for anything less than full federal reimbursement to the states for their costs in providing cash and medical assistance to refugees who have been here 3 years or less with the adoption of my amendment the committee evidenced its conviction that the federal government should be fully responsible for refugeerelated expenditures during the first 3 years the committee thus has fashioned a reasonable and responsible piece of legislation to which i can give my wholehearted support it insures that the federal commitment to our refugee program does not terminate with the refugees arrival here states and localities urgently need federal financial help if they are to join effectively in the effort to resettle them and to place them quickly on the road to selfsufficiency i urge my colleagues support of this meritorious legislation e"]]}
