profound phenomenon has occurred in the ownership of newspapers in this country while the number of daily newspapers has remained fairly constant the growth of groups or chains has become predominant today almost twothirds of the daily newspapers are owned by chains and media conglomerates more significant f the fact that these chains control more than 72 percent of all daily circulation the four largest chains control 30 percent of the nations daily newspaper circulation while the 25 largest chains control over 50 percent of all daily circulation in the past few years the chains have been buying 40 to 50 theretofore independent dailies each year at present there are just over 600 independently owned dailies left in 10 years the independently owned daily now an endangered species may be extinct moreover 10 to 12 chains or media conglomerates may be then control virtually all of our daily newspapers with ties to television cable and other electronic media the same situation prevails in the weekly newspaper field last year some 175 weeklies were purchased by the chainsthe same chains which own and control daily newspapers the trade press reports continued incursions into the weekly newspaper field by these media giants the chains are not establishing new newspapers daily or weekly but are buying out existing newspapers and each purchase results in the loss of an independent community based voice and base of opinion the chains buy newspapers not to enhance the scope of their editorial and reportorial coverage but to maximize greater profits this has been referred to as bottomline journalism they are paying 40 50 and even 60 times annual earnings for the remaining independents they know that the number of newpapers remains constant and they are pulling out all of the stops in this interchain competition to snap up the remaining independents why do the independents sell out obviously the high prices are too great a temptation for some and others find there is no interest in the next generation of their families to operate an independent newspaper however the most significant cause of sales to the chains may be found in the federal estate tax laws this has been attested to by present and former owners of newspapers the president of the evening news association a chain which publishes the detroit news has commented speaking from the point of view of my experiences with this company i would like to reinforce the extreme importance of the federal estate tax media merger decisions there is no other single factor or such importance in my opinion the internal revenue service bases its valuation of an estate on the amount a willing buyer will pay a willing seller thus while an independent newspaper owner may consider value to be 10 to 15 times earnings which is also the priceearnings ratio of publicly traded chains the irs must look to the amount a chain would pay for an independent that is 40 to 60 times earnings for example if a newspaper were earning 250 000 per year its value to a chain might be as high as 12 500 000 the estate tax at 70 percent would be over 81 2 million should the heir to a newspaper seek to borrow such sums to pay estate taxes the annual cost of interest on the loan would be more than three times the newspapers earnings even if in its wisdom and within its discretion the irs should find the value of this newspaper to be only 7 500 000 the tax rateat 70 percentwould require payment of over 5 million this would still be more than the owner could borrow since interest charges would be better than double the earnings of the newspaper is it any wonder that the heirs must sell or that the owner sells prior to death to put his estate in order there are no other options the independent local newspaper act offers a novel approach to the estate tax problem rather than seek a lower tax rate for newspapers or exemptions or exclusions from the sums to be paid or valuation of newspapers at an artificial rate the bill provides for a form of prepayment of the estate tax this is to avoid the catastrophic situation now facing the heirs to a newspaper the independent local newspaper act would allow the owners of an independen newspaper to establish an advance estate tax payments trust to be funded by corporate earnings with not more than 50 percent of pretax income of the newspaper in any year the contributions to and income of the trust may be invested solely in obligations of the united states excess funding of the trust is expressly prohibited the funds accumulated in the trust may be used only to pay the estate taxes of the owners of the newspaper this advance estate tax payment trust does offer major tax benefits to owners of independent newspapers the funding is with pretax income of jit ly 15 1981 the newspaper and sums in thetrust are not a part of the owners estate for tax purposes it must be recognized that with a valuation of 40 to 60 times earnings it will be difficult to fully fund the trust and there must be an incentive for funding however if the owners of the newspapers having established such a trust sell their newspaper the bill provides for penalties which would amount to some 118 percent of the funds in the trust thus there is a carrot to induce maintaining independent newspapers and there is a stick to preclude an attempt to take advantage of this proposal the bill also has a recapture provision should the heirs attempt to sell the newspaper after having benefited from the trust this recapture provision follows the format established in the tax reform act of 1976 also tracking provisions of the tax reform act of 1976 the bill provides for an extension of the time for payment of estate taxes where the estate includes the interests in an independent local newspaper such extensions would be subject to payment of interest this proposed bill has been criticized as special interest legislation the same was said of the family farm or tax reform act of 1976 this bill is at this time limited to newspapers an economic reason is only newspapers are now selling at such egregious ratios with the exacerbating affects this has on estate tax liabilities a more important basis for this legislation is that only the press is referred to and protected in the first amendment to the constitution preservation of the marketplace of ideas through maintenance of independent editorial voices is in the national interest and is a valid basis for this legislation the joint committee on taxation estimated the cost of this proposal at 10 million annually this may be an overstatement of cost and it is possible that the bill could provide a favorable revenue flow and a positive gain to the treasury finally this proposal could serve as a precursor for other family controlled businesses if after passage of the independent local newspaper act it is demonstrated that the act resulted in stemming the tide of newspaper mergers without burdening the treasury the terms of the legislation could and should be expanded to include other categories of industry while the idea of prepaymbnit of estate taxes is novel at this time if this proves successful with newspapers the coverage of the legislation would be broadened so that it is not limited to one industry one final note delay in passage of this legislation will limit the benefits it is intended to provide every week at least one daily and approximatelyfour weekly newspapers will be absorbed by the chains and their independent voices stilled forever unless early action is taken the independent community based newspaper may be as fondly recalled as the carrier pigeon and other species of an earlier time"], [0.4925766587257385, 0.5074233412742615, 1, "a vibrant

commerce this program bers of the administration the need for some positive action on the steel trade issue i would like to share with my colleagues some of the reasons for my strong feelings on this topic in 1974 the late congressman pettis and i formed a steel caucus to deal with the problems which we were experiencing on the west coast with only one minetometal steel facility on the west coastthe kaiser plant at fontana calif national policy on steel imports did not adequately deal with our regional concerns together congressman pettis and i effected some small changes in the trade act of 1974 to deal with our concerns now i am sorry to say the import problems which affected us on the west coast are national in scope basically the western steel market has had import rates at twice the national rates this is due to the relatively small rate of steel production in the region causing imported steel to fill the gap in demand when national steel import rates increase the west coast experiences even higher import levels since the importers are already in place there for example this year the national steel import rate for the first 9 monthis of this year is 18 percent on the west coast the figure for this same period is pegged at 46 percent well above our usual doubling of the national rate this situation has caused kaiser steel to have to do a better job of competing withf foreign producers kaiser invested 200 million in a major plant modernization effort they installed a continuous casting facility a technologv which is one of the most modem available and one which people point to as providing the japanese with a competitive edge they aggressively sought markets by concentrating their production on energyrelated areas producing pipe for oil and gas pipelines they engaged in an aggresive battle with foreign producers and still ost money the reason for this cnntinued loss was the fact that the foreign producers were bringing steel into this country at subsidized prices below the exporting countrys cost of production national import penetration increased and the western steel market had twice those rates then we saw the trigger price mechanism tpm instituted to deal with the dumrpting of foreign steel in our country the tpm set minimum import prices for steel based on cost of production freight costs and a modest profit allowance however the tpm uses japanese cost of production and japanese freight rates to the united states what this means for the west coast is that since it is closest to japan it has a lower freight cost component and has the lowest tpm level in the nation as soon as the tpm went into effect the west coast was flooded with imports as foreign steel producers sought the lowest cost entry point into the united states one clear indication of the west coast being used as an entry p int for imported steel is the fact that while the western steel market accounts for only 8 percent of the national market 20 percent of our national steel imports come in through the west coast this shows me that my suspicions about the tpm levels on the west coast having had a detrimental effect upon our region are correct we now have european steel flooding th western market and european steel s ervice centers being set up on the west coast we had not had much european steel on thle west coast in the past and i think that any rational person would agree that the west coast would not ordinarily be a natural market for european steel we can only assume that this is a result of problems with the setting of the tpm levels on the west coast many of us representing western districts have tried to get this transrortation differential problem corrected we have not met with much success and the tpm formula remains based upon japanese production i am reluctant to advocate the abolishment of the tpm program since it has had some beneficial effects and kaiser steel would be worse off without the tpm what i would like to see is recognition of this inequity in the tpm formula and some serious steps taken to correct this problem but there are other anomalies on the west coast which have contributed to problems there we have a great number of steel centers on the west coast and many foreign producers are buying into these operations this strengthens their competitive p6sition in the western market there is as well a problem with these steel centers buying steel offshore and then bringing in these products circumventing the tpm program these related p~arty transactions must be addressed if the situation is to improve on the west coast i am encouraged by the upcoming trade negotiations with the european community i feel that this is an excellent opportunity for the new administration to correct many of the trade imbalances with the ec which we have endured for the past few years i hope that our negotiating team will be able to get the ec to realize the damage which their trading policies are doing to our domestic steel industry i hope as well that our negotiators remember that regional injury was made a part of the 1979 amendments to the trade act and that any agreements that are made with the ec will have to abide by this provision we in the western steel market will be paying close attention to these negotiations in light of our recent experiences with european steel producers but any action taken with steel imports comes too late for the 3 000 workers who are being laid off at kaiser steel over the next few months because of its losses kaiser is having to shut down its primary facilities its coke ovens and furnaces these facilities will require rebuilding in the near future but kaiser does not have the money necessary to complete the job and still remain a viable operation i will not go into my feeling about the administrations cutbacks in t1ta assistance and training funds at this point programs which would have helped these 3 000 steelworkers i will say that the jobs of the remaining workers and the health of my districts economy depends upon what we in washington do about our trade problems our industry can compete in a fair and open market a modern facility like the kaiser steel plant can compete against foreign producers but this competition must be fair and not involve dumping steel in this country at less than cost of p~oductton"],

current needs of americas vietnam veterans the first part of this bill will address the most perplexing issue facing vietnam veterans since their return from the war over 10 years ago and that is the question of agent orange i have already introduced legislation to compensate vietnam veterans who may be suffering from conditions due to exposure to that deadly herbicide i will continue to push for passage of this legislation but in the meantime i feel that there is an intermediate step that everyone agrees can and should be taken this intermediate step would require that a veteran who feels his condition is a result of exposure to herbicides and who is examined by a va physician and determined to be in need of medical assistance will be provided with the necessary hospitalization or outpatient treatment this will at least assist veterans and their families in defraying the expensive medical costs that areassociated with chronic illnesses cancer et cetera in the meantime the va air force and center for disease control epidemiology studies will hopefully be able to provide us with more definitive evidence of the likelihood that service in vietnam or exposure to herbicides can cause chronic health effects if an association is proven compensation can and will then be paid second my bill will address the recommendations made by the white house interagency work group on phenoxy herbicides to the va regarding their proposed epidemiology study these recommendations were to expand the scope of the study to include the possible effects of factors other than herbicides namely medications dapzone chemicals penta chlorophenol or any other products that may have health implications on veterans who served in southeast asia third this legislation will reauthorize the vietnam veteran outreach centers which in their initial year of operation counseled over 50 000 vietnam veterans and members of their families this program has been tremendously successful and i am encouraged that both the house and senate veterans affairs committees as well as the senate budget committee have included funds for the continuation of the prograni the vet center in sioux falls s dak has counseled over 600 persons many of whom i have spoken with they have been virtually unanimous in their praise for the program and desire for its continuation fully 48 percent of the vietnam veterans visiting these centers have stated that a major impediment to their successful rehabilitation is their inability to find a job as we are all aware most previous government efforts ceta hire i and ii et cetera aimed at assisting vietham veterans in getting a job have been a dismal failure one of the few exceptions to this unfortunate pattern has been the va administered ojt program where 74 8 percent of those enrolled have completed the program and 95 percent have gone on to use their training for actual employment purposes thus the final portion of my legislation will give vietnam veterans identified through the vet centers or other va offices an opportunity to train under the ojt program regardless of whether they have been delimited or not i feel that this last effort should be made to reach out and assist those vietnam veterans who desire to become gainfully employed i have introduced this particular section of the omnibus bill earlier as h r 2391 finally i feel that passage of this omnibus legislation will be a substantive indication to vietnam veterans that every effort is being made to assist them in completing their readjustment from the war and that this nation is behind those who have fought in the past just as it is now behind a new vigorous effort to revitalize its armed forces and seek new recruits for possible future con frontations i hope that

amendment the small generator loophole was the most serious deficiency in the existing rcra system present epa regulations by the way in opposition to the clear legislative language of the statute have been drawn in such a way as to unequivocally exempt 92 percent of the nations hazardous waste generators from virtually all hazardous waste controls on the basis that they are small generators the net effect of this exemption is to explicitly allow generators of up to 2 200 pounds per monththat is over a ton of hazardous waste per monthto dispose of their hazardous wastes into solid waste landfills or local dumps i distinguish between hazardous waste landfills and solid waste landfills that are not capable nor prepared to accept these types of materials these facilities are not designed to contain hazirdous wastes are incapable of protecting ground water supplies and are the leading cause of the nations abandoned and leaking dumpsite problems according to epas own data over 50 percent of the priority superfund sites are such solid waste landfills or local dumps that have previously accepted hazardous waste materials the office of technology assessment the independent bipartisan arm of the congress estimates that this exemption allows up to 2 7 million tons or 6 billion pounds per year of hazardous waste to be disposed of in sanitary solid waste landfills this amount of waste is equivalent to 6 6 percent of the total waste stream in this nation the battelle institute a study that was also undertaken by epa has issued a similar estimate they say it is 7 percent of the solid waste stream that goes under this exemption the ota report also states that the scope and severity of the generation of hazardous wastes by small generators were greatly underestimated by the epa while the gentleman from texas emphasizes epas estimate which has been criticized by ota is 1 percent of the national waste stream the exact percentage in my opinion is irrelevant whatever percentage is put into the equation we are still talking about billions of pounds of hazardous wastes potentially being put into our drinking water supplies moreover epa in may of 1980 committed to a lowering of the small generator exemption based upon the vgwy 1 percent estimate that the gentleman now refers to as the basis for his proposal of inaction the only thing that has really changed is epas policy on this very important issue epa now believes that the exemption is not a significant problem despite the overwhelming additional evidence to the contrary epa has even denied the waste disposal industrys petition to close this loophole the agepey also asserts that its previous study of the small generator exemption is sufficient yet they support this amendment which does nothing more than to study the problem for an additional 3 years this is really a classic example of a calculated policy of inaction groping around for a justification earlier this year the public and the congress were outraged and appropriately so when epa lifted the ban on the disposal of containerized liquid hazardous wastes into hazardous waste landfills that is landfills that are supposed to be prepared to accept those materials other provisions of this legislation deal with needed restrictions on the types of wastes that can be placed into hazardous waste landfills however unless similar restrictions are placed on hazardous waste disposal at solid waste landfills the environmental consequences will be disastrous this is because 92 percent of the hazardous waste generators can now freely dispose under this exemption of their hazardous wastes at local dumps which are totally unsuited for receiving this type of material consider the irony of the following situation the current small generator exemption of 12 tons per year translates roughly into a volume of 60 drums if a nonexempt big generator were to dispose of a load of 60 drums into a sanitary solid waste landfill there would be public outrage however if a small generator as defined by epa disposed of 60 drums of the same material it is legal although the fact of the matter is that the harm to the environment would be indistinguishable in devising a remedy for this serious loophole the committee examined the report and the recommendations of ota and the policies of 20 individual states that have already restricted or totally eliminated the small generator exemption i am going to for a specific purpose read the list of the states arkansas california illinois indiana kansas louisiana massachusetts michigan missouri minnesota new hampshire new jersey new york north dakota ohio oregon rhode island south carolina vermont and washington parenthetically i note that the state of texas department of health is on the verge of lowering its own small generator exemption according to information that we have from the assoelation of state and territorial solid waste management officials i took the time to read this list for a very important reason i do not know how any congressperson from any of those states can support the amendment of the gentleman from texas and then go home to his constituents and say that we in our state have removed this exemption but i voted against making this a national standard such that state x which is immediately adjacent to us allows these 12 tons per year to be dumped in their landfill infiltrating into the aquifer that knows nothing about state boundaries which is now polluting our water this is a totally indefensible position in addition the ashland chemical co is already operating a small generator and waste collection and treatment service in 34 of its 60 major markets many of which are in states that already restrict this loophole let me deal finally with one of the arguments that i know is superfically very perbuasive the question about small business and the impact on small business of removing this loophole the argument is that this is somehow antismall business that is pure nonsense i would ask any of the congresspersons from those states that have already taken this action if they have had a whole lot of small business people beating down their doors prior to the initial consideration of h r 6307 saying that retail clean ers are going out of business gasoline stations are going out of business because these 20 states have already taken that action the answer is they have not the reasoning is we are not talking about mom and pop retail operations generating 12 tons a month of dioxin of pcbs or phosgene or phenol we are not talking about small businesses average neighborhood stores we are talking about rela tively large generators of these wastes now is the time to act on this matter and not to sanction

floor who believe strongly and powerfully that this drug problem must be addressed i would simply say to them in the process of dealing with the drug problem will we unalterably distort and pervert our way of government and our way of life we have never allowed ourselves to see law enforcement agents in military uniformsnever every time that issue came forward many of us felt great pain i do not want to return to the days of the 1960s when we needed troops to implement laws that civilians were charged with the responsibility to implement and i certainly do not want to go further than thr t to nazi germany where i can see uniforms involved in implementing laws and enforcing laws that civilians ought to be enforcing so this gentleman will say to you irrespective of whether there is a constitutional concern we all in this room know that we have evolved a way of life that has separated out clearly the civilian function and the military function i do not think we need 226 billion to be talking about waging war in the world let alone waging war in this country i find it ludicrous and tragic that many of my colleagues supported a budget resolution that substantially cut the budget of the drug enforcement agency and then said but i want to go home and tell my constituents that i am not soft on communism so i voted for a big military budgetand oh by the way we have a drug problem and since we cut the money out of dea let us go over where we are putting all the money and get the military to solve the problem then maybe this gentleman ought to say i think we need to deal with mass transit in this country maybe we ought to get the military to develop a mass transit system i think we olight to better educate our children but since all the money is going to the pentagon maybe we ought to get pentagon personnel to educate our children we need housing in this country for tens of thousands of human beings but since much of our money is going to the pentagon maybe we ought to let the corps of engineers build the housing your response would be that is a civilian function we do not need the military to engage in this activity i am simply saying to you if it is not good enough to try to build mass transit to educate our children it is reasonable to say that we will not do it in terms of law enforcement if we have a significant problem of law enforcement in this country then let us address it but let us not delude ourselves into believing we can simply throw the ball to the military and run home and say i have done something for the drug problem when we have perverted and distorted our way of government we need to effectively keep that dichotomy between civilian and military once we put law enforcement people in military uniform we conjure up in peoples minds the agony of nazi germany and the pain in the 1960s when many in this country chose not to address the problems and we were forced to have the military deal with it i do not think the drug enforcement agents are saying we do not want to implement the laws what they are saying is we need the necessary capability to do i and that is not turning that function over to the pentagon so i would conclude by saying that it is my hope that we are not treading on constitutionality and even it we are not we are treading on a way of life that should be precious to us and in the process of solving the problem let ub not create problems for our childrens future and their childrens future"], [0.49282681941986084, 0.5071731805801392, 1, "on october 15 1981 iintroduced hr 4762 a bill to create an intercircuit tribunal of the unitedstates courts of appeals the proposed legislation will provide necessary help where it is needed most in the federal judicial system at the appellate level i am pleased that the chairman of my committee mr rodino and two minority members on my subcommittee mr railsback and mr butler have joined in cosponsoring this proposal the intercircuit tribunal of the unitedstates courts of appeals act is a modest idea which uses for the most part existing judicial resources the new panel also will rely on existing manpower in the unitedstates marshals servic it therefore will be extremely low in cost the tribunal will be composed of between 14 and 22 circuit judges who are in regular active service or who are senior judges the judges are to be designated by the chief justice of the united states the tribunal is a patch that fits neatly in the larger tapestry of the federal judiciary the new name symbolizes this fit rather than creating a national court of appeals with transfer jurisdiction from the other courts of appealswhich actually suggests to some a lowered status for the existing excircuit courtsthe tribunal will have reference jurisdiction from the supreme court of the united otates thus all petitions for review continue to be routed to the supreme court furthermore after the rendering of a judgment by the intercircuit tribunal a petition for certiorari may once again be filed in the supreme court in the final analysis therefore any argument that this new court would act as a gatekeeper and redurce access to the supreme court must fail analysis the supreme court will remain in the words of chief justice earl warren th~e ultimate tribunal to which all citizens poor or rich may submit their claims moreover the proposed legislation dovetails neatly with the proposal to create a court of appeals for the federal circuit which presently is moving n through both the house and the senate and which hopefully wvill be enacted into law during the 97th congress sonmc commentators have argued that that bill is a national court of appeals in disguise the legislation that i am introducing today is further evidence that that argument is specious the intercircuit tribunal will be a temporary entity since it is sunsetted after 5 years due to the courts experimental nature there are reportback provisions so that congress might determine whether the court has been a failure or a success before discussing the reasons for the legislation i briefly would like to delineate its background in 1971 chief justice warren burger acting in his napacity as chairman of the federal judicial center appointed a sevenmember study group on the caseload of the supreme court the socalled freund group studied the myriad problems affecting the supreme court and submitted recommendations for change in 1972 in 1973 the congress created a commission on revision of the federal court appellate system called the hruska commission after its chairman to study the structure and internal procedures of the federal circuit courts of appeal in different forms the freund group and the hruska commission both recommended the creation of a national court of appeals their recommendation was in response to a finding by both commissions that serious caseload problems existed in the federal appellate system requiring the immediate attention of congress shortly thereafter in 1977 my subcommitteethe subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justiceheld 7 days of oversight hearings on the state of the judiciary and access to justice we received testimony from individuals who had participated in the foundation work on the freund group and the hruska commisoion testimony also was heard from the policymaking arm of the federal judiciary the judicial conference of the united states because of the serious nature of the questions considered by the subcommittee the chief justice of the united states warren e burger participated by submitting a written statement into the record the testimony and statements presented by the respected witnesses confirmed that the federal judiciary was indeed suffering from endemic overload as observed in a department of justice report submittted into the re rd by former solicitor general robert bork the federal courts however now ftxce a crisis of overload a crisis so seriour that it threatens the capacity of the federal system to function as it should this is not a crisis for the courts alone it is a crisis for litiganti who seek justice for claims of humrnn rights for the rule of law and it is therefore a crisis for the nation as regards the appellate capacity of the federal court system this overload was described as having especially deleterious effects one of the main functions of appellate courts is to insure uniformity and consistency in the law by resolving conflicts in decisions between or among trial courts or lowcr appellate courts the supreme courtwhich of course sits at the apex of the federal judicial systemcan devote plenary consideration only to about 150 cases a year hundreds of other petitions from the circuit courts have to be left unsettled some of these appeals are of high national priority or identify serious splits among the circuits some concern individual rights guaranteed by the constitution and sonmc relate to the delicate balance of powers in our federal union since my subcommittees hearings appellate court problems have actually worsened congress has had a hand in this in moving to resolve court congestioni we have substantially broadened the base of the judicial pyramid perhaps because problems are easier to identify at the trial level perhaps because they are more amenable to legislation solution congress acted several times during the 95th and 96th congresses to confront problems at the trial level of the federal judiciary the unitedstates magistrates system was reformed a comprehensive bankruptcy act was passed and an omnibus judgeship bill was enacted these legislative initiativesconsidered collectivelydramatically broadened the ground floor of the judicial pyramid the net result has been dramatic statistical increases in the number of appeals being taken from the district courts to the circuit courts and ulti~iately to the supreme court with the exception of the creation of a handful of circuit judges circuit council reform and the split of the fifth circuit nothing has been legislatively enacted that would imnprove the functioning of the federal appellate system it is noteworthy in this regard that the modest appellate improvements mentioned above have assisted the courts of appeals while actually placing more burdens on the supreme court in short the workload of the supreme courtwhich in 1972 as being at the satuation pointis now assuming even more dangerous proportions as a consequence immediate remedial measures are called for these measures should not dramatcally alter the nature of the high court rather they should rely on its essential role in the american judicial system several things can be done first diversity of citizenship jurisdiction ought to be abolished there is a high number of appeals in these cases and therefore the elimination of diversity would actually improve the functioning of all elementstrial and appellatein the federal court system i already have introduced legislation see h r 2404 97th congress 1st session 1981 to accomplish this end similarly the mandatory jurisdiction of the supreme court should be eliminated we rely on the supreme court to resolve cases on the merits we certainly can rely on the court to determine which cases it can hear for my legislation to accomplish this end see h r 2408 97th congress 1st session 1081 last as explained above we should create an intercircuit tribunalcomposed of sitting circuit judges to assist the supreme court in satisfying its enormous responsibilities by deciding matters assigned to it by the supreme court the tribunal would be of enormous assistance to the high court especially in the area of resolving circuit conflicts and insuring national uniformity of the laws i believe that the ultimate beneficiaries would be all the people in this country i encourage my colleagues to take a hard look at this legislation many of the members of the house and judiciary committees have informally considered this idea at the last of our williamsburg meetings their initial support has encouraged me to work on this legislative proposal i already have shared a draft with chief justice warren burger and prof leo levin director of the federal judicial center as individuals they have expressed support for this modest proposal have encouraged its introduction and have asked for its careful consideration by all interested members of congress in closing i urge your support for this bill the text of the bill follows h r 4762 a bill to establish an intercircuit tribunal of the united states courts of appeals and for other purposes be it enacted by the senate and house of represent ativcs of the united states of america in congress assembled that this act may be cited as the intercircuit tribunal of the united states courts of appeals act"], [0.4928925037384033, 0.5071074962615967, 1, "i economit stabilaty throughi the

these funds are a supplementadditionar funds to provide enrfchment is eliminated this means the federal money can be used to replace local revenueslocal maintenance of effort need not be maintainedinstead of enriching the educational experience of a disadvantaged child to compensate for deprivation equality of educational opportunity in a sekregated sdtting is pushed beyond all reason this intensifies the issue of busing iwonder how can those opposed to busing also oppose improving the neighborhood schools the other point ri this discussion concerns a vocationall education which is also being cut 25 percent the first year and 20 percent thereafter while the federal share is small the amount levers state and local finds as well as some private money ione may well ask where are skilled persons to come from to fill the jobs in defense since less than 8 percent of jobs require no definitive skill where again one may ask even in the private sector are persons to acquire those skills sfnce virtually all training programs are being abolished or restricted iwage rates dinflation are sure to escalate let me conclude with an overall observaition defense expendituresejustiffedor notare highly inflationary economists agree that the vietnam buildup contributed to the stagnation that set irr during the 197wt and contnues today presrdent johnson refused to finance defense by taiatioh and left it to inflatitn if defense has the high prtority the proponents contend especially if the case is built on a current weakness that prevails then it follows that the public would be willing and should be asked to support it with the necessary funds it should therefore be funded on its merit rather than from domestic programs in total disregard of evaluation reports as to their cost effectiveness and their relationship to critical human needa today the situation is even more acute we start with high inflationseveral times moreinstead of simply not increasing taxes to pay for defense buildup we now propose to reduce taxes we say to the public do not worry about footing the bill for defense security you will receive a tax gift instead let the social programs pay the bills however in this story with a sad ending the problem of inflation remains the structural programs that offer the real hope of reducing the inflation pressures of breaking the bottlenecks of skill shortages in defense industries and of reducing the costs of governments are being dismantled the story need not end there under the cbc proposal we can move ahead to invigorate the economy through a progressive tax reduction arid without sacrificing defense we can target our spending on costeffective programs in health housinz education energy andi other essential domestic priority areas we can attack inflation with key structural programs while insisting on lower interest rates and oil prices this is the way to go let history recoid we had the good sense to act before it was too late o

occasion is to comply with an indication and a promise i had made with respect to the resolutions and the bills i have introduced concerning the federal reserve board highinterestrate question and related financial fiscal monetary matters that agitate the country and flagellate it so severely i said before that when i introduced last year the resolution calling for the impeachment of the chairman of the federal reserve board paul volcker and then subsequently the followup resolution that included the members of the open market committee socalled which means the federal reserve board plus five private bankers i was ridiculed to a certain extent not too much but some and i have gone through this before all through my career such as it is in elective public office i was ridiculed when i initiated my career on the city council of the city of gan antonio when singlehandedly i advocated called for fought for and i mean i use the word fight advisedly i never talk a fight if i am going to get in a fight i fight a fight i try to avoid one but if i get in one i am going to fight it i am not going to pull punches and i am not going to talk it i am going to fight it at that time it had to do with the socalled city water board water utility it was structured very much the same as the present light and gas utility is in my area i had started the fight on that one when i left the city council to seek the position of state senator and won that so that the fight still remains unsolved and is in fact the main reason why the city of san antonio continues to be so victimized in fact robbed in the most vital section of all which is the indispensable energy light and gas to the people today but at that time the city water board was structured the same way it was a closed selfperpetuating cooperation anchored down in what they considered then as iron and an indenture that had been entered into in 1925 and here in 1953 with an indenture that had a life of 40 years people ridiculed me laughed at me at first in fact were absolutely insulting and then later when it aroused the publics attention and the knowledgeable citizens support then there was anger toward me and i had everything from threats to actual attempts to try to frame me up all of which in effect and strangely enough i think contributed to the main reason why i am here today as an elected congressman from that district i do not think that if those fights had not been fought and won incidentally eventually that i would be here today because i certainly have never had any kind of organized backing of money or base of any perpetual type and have had to confront all of those forces but wlhat i am saying is that on the local level it was no different except just the scale than wnat i have confronted here on some of the fights that i have found myself engaged in during the last 20 years that i have had the great privilege of serving in this capacity so when i introduced these resolutions i had some comment and some commentators in fact just not too long ago the very prominent magazine newsweek had an extensive article on paul volcker specifically and the federal reserve generally and the gentleman who wrote the article made allusion to me and said that i even had a grandstand resolution of impeachment of paul volcker but interestingly enough the very next line he said however it must be admitted there is no other way that a chairman can be removed well i thought in a way that was a sort of lefthanded respectful admission that maybe i did have a serious purpose and that there was a serious and logical reason upon which i based my motivation for introducing the iesolution but more importantly i consider the two bills that i introduced contemporaneously that have to do with what i consider to be the long overdue congressional oversight and responsibility for seeing in 1913 when the congress passed the federal reserve act of 1913 but things have become so contrived and so distorted that even members of the congress have talked to me in terms of such a nature that the federal reserve is considered to be a separate independent whohy autonomous institution that they infer sprung from the brow of job where as a matter of fact it is a creature it is a creature of congress it is a creature of the people the congress being the representatives of the people the federal reserve board is indeed not an autonomous selfgoverning selfdetermining body but it has behaved that way to where it now believes it and in the 20 years that i have been on the banking committee in the congress 20 years and 3 months to be exactly i have seen no member of the federal reserve board i have seen no chairman of the federal reserve board ever come to the congress and answer a question having to do with the most responsive and responsible activity of any organization and that is accountability accountability as to how how they arrive at their judgmental decisions that determine whether or not the american people will continue to be robbed by extortionate rates of interest never the only agents we have such as the gao as long ago as 18 years ago told me that they had no jurisdiction to do that they could not go in they call it an audit i was not asking for an audit i was merely asking to find out what were the procedures in these judgmental decisions in fact even as to administration of the entity itself and who if anybody in the federal reserve boards structure itself would be responsible for oversight did they do they now have such an office as an office of inspector general i do not know i cannot find out from anybody obviously not from the lack of accountability but it has reached such a point that i is ridiculous last month the president had a secret meeting with the chairman of the federal reserve board can you imagine the chief executive of our country having to have a secret meeting to reckon with and discuss the question of high interest rates and related matters that have to do with monetary and fiscalpolicy in secret and the chairman of the board being obsequious to accept and go over and sit down and meet in secret they never did come out you know it is jut as if it were two heads of foreign states having a summit meeting except that they never have issued a communique you do not know what they agreed on so the speculation in the wall street journal the speculation in the washington post by the official writers and the experts and the either selfappointed or paidforbeing experts all have said and i am sure it is conjecture because even they did not say they have sources and the only sources would be paul volcker or president ronald reagan but they say that there obviously was no understanding as to whether or not mr volcker would yield even a little bit in what is in the jargon of that world tight money policy the real issue and i think the one that is attributable directly to the fact that a nation such as ours would have reached that hardtobelieve point where it would not only tolerate but accept without whimper a 21percentplus interest rate as a prime rate mind you a prime rate and never in the history of any country never in the written history of mankind even going back to the time preceding jesus christ even the jewish elders even they had laws in fact at one time one of those ancient kings mandated illegal on penalty of death any payment of interest then subsequent to that and by the time jesus christ appeared on mankinds horizon it was illegal at a certain rate then and all through mankinds history why because and i have not seen any economists i have not seen anybody on our level come and define it this way because interest rate or rates is a mechanism by virtue of which the wealth of a society is transferred it is that simple but now i rise because i promised that if i could i would try to get seri ous consideration of the first impeachment resolution why the impeachment resolution is that a showmansbip a gimmick to get publicity well if i thought so i would be pretty dumb i have a lot of other ways that i think i have garnered in 28 years of public elective office that are easier shorter and quicker to get publicity but i do so because it is necessary to have somehow an awakening of a responsibility first on the part of the congress my colleagues as to the absolute need to go back as we should have done several decades ago to complete or try to complete the continuing process really of the federal reserve act because things have happened that have canceled out the main reason why the federal reserve act was adopted but when we study history and in fact to the very beginning of our government as we understand it that is under this constitution this has been the central problem it is to me unbelievable that in 1981 and 1982 we would have reached the point that is absolutely the same as the first congress confronted when it had to originate and found what they called the bank of north america then the first bank of the united states a 20year charter they had the same issues what is the issue let us face it squarely and without any kind of folderol or fancy words the issue is power who is going to exercise the power of control oi money over the people and that means interest rates and hamilton himselfyou know when you use labels i dislike labels because they are never accuratebut even by any loose terminology in the abuse of words today i think hamilton would have been considered the conservative of the day even he and what he is recorded in history as having said even jefferson who was for more vehement if i were to say about bankers today what jefferson said i would be assailed immediately as a bitter antibanker congressman but the reason they said it was for that central reason but they had the honesty the courage the intregity to control and not let the control get out of the peoples hands so the first two banks were successful even though by the time andrew jackson came along and you had the failure to renew the charter or the bank other conditions had crept in naturally because by then our country was bustling it was bursting at the seams it was expanding but what was the central issue the same as in the beginning where were the credit allocations going to come from in order to fire the engines of industry and new manufacture so then we jumped we hit the civil war and everybody even in the congress has forgotten the 1865 national currency act that is the one that gave birth to the socalled national banking system again what was the central issue the same one who is going to control the country now is trying to lick its wounds forge ahead the industrial revolution was really bound up exponentially and the country was again bursting at the seams so you had the depression the depression of the 1870s and then a refurbishing and a reenactment of the national act in 1b95 or thereabouts but even then control was still lost sight of and so in 1907 the country again had reached the point where it was continuing to expand tremendously it was going into areas beyond continental north america and therefore the needs for credit and the like were even greater they were exponential again and what happened that socalled banking system was doing the same thing that the federal reserve is trying to do now and so what happened you had the calamitous depression of 1907 and finally in 1912 the congress trying to answer it could not do it bilaterally you could not get a joint congressional action so finally the house of representatives enacted a resolution and created the pujo committee that was the father of the 1913 federal reserve act and what was it they came up with the restructuring to meet the conditions of 1912 and 1913 of the original central question that confronted george washington alexander hamilton thomas jefferson james madison and our great great founding fathers and later andrew jackson and later abraham lincoln and later those presidents who followed abraham lincoln and then woodrow wilson in 1912 and and when you read the memoirs of carter glass when you read the memoirs of those who were trying to forge the congressional action that became labeled the federal reserve act of 1913 and you read about the stony silence and the incipient resistance that woodrow wilson met when he met privately with the bankers in the white house and carter glass and them the struggle was the same the issue was the same but for the moment at least the power was still defined essentially in control of the people but by 1923 and the creation of such a thing as the open market committee remember what gives rise to that entity but what it did was to open the door to the fox to get into the chicken coop at will and from then on it has been just a matter of what discretionary judgment the fox march 25 1 982 is going to use as to how many chickens he thinks he has to consume at any given moment that is exactly what it amounts to today because then that has been compounded since 1952 with this gimmickry that postures the united states uniquely we are the only country in the world in the industrialized world or any other where we allow our money to be handled this way where our tax money handlers for our government pays interest on its money no other country does that in the whole world yet that has gone unchallenged not even debated so the usurpation as i charge of the rightful powers of the federal reserve as exercised through the chairman and the members of the board on the open market committee is certainly within the definition of impeachable offenses and so i promised the last time that if i failed to receive any serious consideration by the house judiciary committeeand i read into the record the last time the letter i had received from chairman rodino in which he says that he instructed the staff to look over the requesti have not heard the results of that instruction i do not know but he said that he did not think that there could be much action because the committee was overloaded it had a very pressing schedule so i said well within a reasonable amount of time if it looks obvious that it will not receive serious consideration by the responsible committee then i will proceed to have a de facto judiciary committee proceeding of impeach ment on the house floor and i here and now announce that the next time that i am privileged to address the house i will initiate such a proceeding in the meanwhile i think that it is obvious now we have the very same administration and its spokesmen the money managers the money regulators of all of these institutions are now coming in for instance as of yesterday and the day before yesterday the chief regulators the chairman of the federal deposit insurance corporation the chairman of the home loan bank board who finally admitted yesterday to what we could not get him to admit a year ago and mind you i say this not because i want to say i told you so or he is to blame or she is to blame but because if we can trigger actioni am not interested in this gamesmanship of blamesmanship this is what the president has been doing since he was sworn in this is what everybody in and out of congress has been doingblaming somebody blaming carter or blaming this or blaming thatwhen what we need is to get together to devise an affirmative program to correct the ills because as finally admitted yesterday even if interest rates were to fall now it is too late the chairman of the home loan bank board said many of these institutions are gone they are dead some of those even now that have been temporarily salvaged through the socalled gimmickry of mergering they are still not out of the woods but if this is not reversed a substantial number will be out before the end of the year now what kind of business is this in america in the united states how far have we gone down the trail of the primrose path of compla ency of trying to whistle as we passed a graveyard and cannot somebody on the part of our responsible appointed leaders or elected leaders either executive or congressional have the fortitude and the courage to say ok even if it means that i will be charged with eating crow even if it means that i will be charged with having to backpedal on what i said was my program and indispensable to america for its salvation even if it means that i will lose my seat this next november or at any future time this is what we must get together on basically this is what we must do to solve the problem not to find the excuses to try to seek action of an emergency nature that at best is temporary and may save or may not save a few maybe maybe not maybe not for long because a way can be found that will save face i think we have already paid an enormous price in blood and money for that kind of policy in the other areas in international areas what i am saying today is that the essential problem confronting our government our people our leaders is basically the same one that has confronted our country since the beginning of this form of government insofar as fiscal and monetary matters are concerned but that now because of the nature of the changed world we have a factor over which we have up to now even minimal control and that is the international that we must take into account some of which may be amenable to american government control but this is the area that now has escaped the vigilance and the accountability that we ought to demand for the american people after all this is what it is all about the issue is not whether reaganomics is rigidly right or rigidly wrong the issue is not whether henry gonzalez is going to be reelected or should be reelected the issue is how are we serving the american people and even if the american people can be fooled as they have can be lulled as they have mostly because they are not informed mostly because as on the international level the issues are not honestly presented to them because leaders are fearful that the american people might be frightened or that their anger will be such that they will be thrown out of office i have been privileged to travel especially in the last year in behalf of the subcommittee that i chair on housing and urban development from the eastern shore to california and what i see there does not confirm the fear and the lack of confidence that i see reflected in our political leaders i see courage i see greatness among the plain average american who says just give us the truth what are you afraid of tell us what is the truth we do not know we entrusted it to you we assume that you at least ought to know what are the issues and this is where i think we have been victimized on the international level as long as we have not found a way to control or at least thwart the enormous power of such entities as opec for example and or our overwhelming dependencon the particular power that that entity controls is a continuing challenge and it has tremendous impact on monetary and fiscal matters as it does in every other level because of the intractable link between our energy consumption or our need for energy and the basic progress and augmentation not an economy of scarcity not an economy of blight but the proverbial economy of plenty and prosperity and a fair share for every american not block him out of his share of the american way of life this is what is at stake this is what has been at stake i take pride in having identified it that way first locally back home and then up here for not 10 years not 15 years not whch the republican administration was in power but when a personal friend was in powerand i was just as critical in some areas then as i am now for the stated reasons on recordbut as i said in the beginning just as in the case of the local fights if i am not rebutted if my questions are not successfully answered i will not stop persisting and this is all i believe that one man can do but i believe we have reached the point now where for many americans individuals and collective businesses there is no point of return this is lamentable because it was inevitable high interest rates are not god ordained high interest rates are not an act of god and yet the chairman of the fed presidents of the united states colleagues of mine in congress great industrial leaders and manufacturing firm heads all have talked to me all have spoken all have written as if it is an act of god as if you cannot do anything what is the matter with you now they are saying well you see you have this debt and you have this deficit but we have had worse relationships before and we are not flagellated with 21 percent rates not even 10 percent so as i initiate what i consider to be the ad hoc substitute de facto hnpeachment proceedings on the house floor i will further elaborate and document these statements that i have made today because i think no matter what happens inescapably the american government and its leaders will have to confront this issue they will have to confront the restructuring of the federal reserve act they will have to consider and bring about and the sooner the better whether it is long range or short range the federal reserve board will have to yield to accountability as long as it is not it cannot have it both ways the president himself has admitted that yes the federal reserve board has something to do with the reason for high interest rates the federal reserve board says oh no that is not our target we are not handling monetary or fiscal policy in such a way as to impact on interest rates interest rates are due to the lack of confidence or because of deficit or the national debt or something or inflation they were saying inflation yet i offer for the record at this point a lead article in the washington post which isthey call it the weekly business advocate newspaperthe chamber of commerce publication and the title is interest rate level puzzles experts too well the reason it puzzles is they have been making all kinds of outrageous statements and attempting to perpetuate these myths as to who the culprit is in other words blame joe what i call the present game of blamesmanship and everybody is indulging in it even now instead of saying wait a while to this extent it is my baby and here is what i think i can do about it and here is what i suggest now let us get together this is what i think i will humbly attempt to do in an individual and perhaps a very small way because it is too late to worry about who is to blame for this that and the other we have a whole history going back to 1789 if we want to find causes and figures to blame and all that but at this point we have got to seek the path out of the jungle on our own we cannot expect americans who live no longer than 1920 even those that were living in 1950 because we got another world it is another country it is another set of horses but basically the issue is the same who is going to rule the american people in their most vital way that is their economic wellbeing the bank ers or their representatives and their government the article i refer to follcws"],

plan to offer and the budget alternatives proposed by representatives jones obey fauntroy aspin and miller the republican substitutes adopt the cuts in federal housing assistance proposed by the administrations february budget request which would obliterate 40 years of bipartisan federal support for housing the democratic alternatives would freeze federal support for housing at fiscal year 1982 levels and at least preserve our countrys commitment to decent and affordable housing for all americans as a congressman from the bronx in new york city i know well the critical role federal housing programs have played in preserving the neighborhoods in my district the republican budget alternatives would put an end to most of these programs they would abolish all federal housing construction programs slash public housing operating and moderization subsidies and force recipients of federal rent supplements to pay an even larger proportion of their limited incomes for rent these budget substitutes would have the federal government abandon our nations housing problems at a time of crisis and would be unfair to the relatively few people who would continue to receive federal housing assistance the administrations budget recommendations call for the rescission of 16 4 billion appropriated for lowinc ome housing in 1982 and 1983 approval of these rescissions would result in the cancellation of 300 000 of the 700 000 subsidized units now in the pipeline this combined with a cut in the number of new units requested under this years budget authority would result in the loss of nearly onehalf million units over the course of the next decade the presidents proposed cuts would eliminate the section 8 and public housing construction programs although the implementation of section 8 was complicated by changes in the unitedstates general economic condition by the end of june 1981 approximately 1 061 000 were occupied and about onehalf of the residents were elderly although there is a desperate shortage of affordable rental housing in almost every major urban area of our country the administration is determined to go ahead with its cuts in federal construction programs the poor are not the only ones who will be hurt by these cutbacks in construction the housing industry will also be hurt by these cuts which come at a time when the industry can least afford it already suffering from high unemployment rates and from a squeeze on its financial resources these cuts in construction outlays will deal another severe blow to the construction business it is not just construction programs that the administration proposes to eliminate the administration calls for cuts in funding of operating and rehabilitation expenses for public housing as well while public housing programs have come a long way in providing decent housing for our nations poor the need for government expenditures in this area had far from disappeared without taking into account the administrations budget cuts for this year public housing authorities across the country already face tremendous difficulties public housing authorities in chicago and detroit are deeply in debt and those operating in boston philadelphia newark and st paul have exhausted their operating reserves the problem for phas is more than just meeting operating expenses the need for more units of public housing and for rehabilitation of existing units is tremendous 11ationwide over 10 percent of all public housing needs improvements in new york state as a whole and in my district in the bronx this figure jumps to over 25 percent furthermore there is a need for additions to the housing stock in new york city the official rate of vacancy of rental units is less than 2 3 percent not only has the reagan administration proposed to eliminate the section 8 and ioublic housing construction programs and cut funds for operation and rehabilitation of public housing the administration has recommended the overhaul of section 8 existing program which provides rent supplement payments changes in section 8 existing fall in two main categories first revisions in recipient contributions and second establishment of a voucher system in an effort to reduce the cost of section 8 existing the reagan administration has introduced a series of measures which seek to increase the amount an individual will have to contribute toward housing first rather than contributing 15 to 25 percent of their income to rent recipient will now be required to spend 30 percent of their income toward rent the amount that an individual will have to contribute will actually be higher because the administration would require that food stamps be counted as part of income in new york the requirement that food stamps be counted as income will in and of itself raise rents 26 percent the cultural effect of all the changes is more devastating in addition to modifying the formula for calculating recipient contributions the administrations plan calls for establishing avoucher program while the budget does not detail the type of voucher program advocated the central thrust of such a proposition is to decrease government involvement in housing and to increase reliance on the private sector by issuing vouchers which may be used toward paying rent on a unit which recipients locate themselves a study by the pratt center concluded that such a plan would be unworkable in new york given the citys extremely low rental vacancy rate furthermore the voucher plan would effectively eliminate the ability of the government to target housing assistance to particular neighborhoods consequently the abandonment and decline of some urban neighborhoods is likely to continue if the only alternative of the congress were to adopt or reject the republican budget substitutes the future of housing in this country would be very bleak fortunately the democratic alternatives would continue budget authority and outlays for housing at fiscal year 1982 levels and thus permit funding of the omnibus housing bill h r 5731 introduced by representative gonza ez and reported out by the house banking committee the gonzalez proposal addresses the needs of low and moderateincome people who live in rural as well as urban areas targets assistance to those who need assistance the most and maintains upgrades and expands the public housing stock the gonzalez housing proposal may be divided into three parts lowincome housing assistance a new multifamily housing production program and help for singlefamily homeowners the gonzalez proposal authorizes 12 5 billion for additional lowincome housing assistance this money would be spent both for modernization of public housing units and the construction of an additional 136 000 units the additional units include 15 000 public housing units 25 000 section 8 existing units and 76 000 conversions to section 8 from other programs as well 4 000 indian public housing units and 16 000 section 202 units for the elderly or handicapped in addition to its rehabilitation and construction provisions the gonzalez bill includes 32 million for public housing projects with operating deficits and a financial adjustment factor faf to make new section 8 projects which are already in the pipeline feasible in addition to these lowincome housing assistance programs the gonzalez bill calls for continued assistance of rural housing programs at 1982 funding levels and for the establishment of new multifamily housing production program the new multifamily housing production program would support 50 000 to 100 000 additional units of which at least 20 percent must be for lowerincome households the legislation stipulates that these projects be located in areas with a severe shortage of rental housing opportunities for families and individuals without other reasonable and affordable housing alternatives in the private market in recognition of the difficulties presently facing singlefamily homeownerf and the construction industry the gonzalez plan calls for programs which aid families that already own their own homes and those who wish to acquire homes the first of these programs would continue and expand the 235 program according to the national low income housing coalition this program would assist some 100 000 in financing their homes a second program would provide 760 million in emergency loans for some 76 000 homeowners to assist homeowners and the construction industry the bill sets aside 3 5 billion for construction of singlefamily homes and condos and provides interest subsidies down to a 9 5 percent rate for 10 years with half of the subsidies paid back at the time of resale additionally all pha mortgage and insurance programs would be extended for another year the bill also contains a small but significant provision which authorizes 3 million for the neighborhood reinvestment corporation to expand its demonstration program of mutual housing associations a mutual housing association is a private nonprofit corporation which develops owns and manages housing for people of low and moderate income the concept is based on extensive experience in western europe with professional nonprofit housing associations i initiated this concept in the congress 2 years ago and am delighted the housing subcommittee decided to provide additional support for the excellent work done by the neighborhood reinvestment corporation in testing the potential of mutual housing associations to help meet american housing problems if the gonzalez proposal were adopted we would maintain our present federal commitment to decent and affordable housing on the other hand to adopt the presidents plan would be to strike at the core of federal housing programs in this country the stark difference between the two proposals may be seen by examining the effect of each on the production of new lowincome housing units the presidents proposed rescissions and budget cuts would result in the loss of nearly onehalf million units over the next 10 years with some 300 000 of these resulting from the cancellation of projects already in the pipeline the gonzalez bill would save these 300 000 units and add an additional 136 000 units this contrast between the republican and democratic budget

over our energy research and development program i am convinced that to proceed with this project is not in the best interests of a balanced energy program and that breeder technology will not be commercially feasible until at least the year 2030 as you all are aware we are facing a serious budget crunch that has forced drastic cuts in the area of energy research as well as many other areas of the budget funds for coal solar other nuclear projects and conservation have all experienced major budget cutbacks over the past 2 years while we have cut these other aspects of our energy program funding for basic breeder research and the clinch river reactor has been preserved currently this one clinch river project and the basic breeder research program consume over 35 percent of our energy research and development funds it is important that our energy program be balanced and we not put all of our eggs in one basket research and development of other nuclear systems fusion coal solar and conservation must receive adequate attention in our research program at the same time one might be able to make a case for large expenditures on both breeder technology and the crbr if there were convincing arguments that the crbr was critically needed to solve our energy problem but the fact of the matter is that breeder reactors will not be commercially viable until well into the next century at the earliest consider these facts utilization of breeders for energy will be more expensive than the current use of lightwater reactorsno one disputes this fact because of rising costs of lightwater reactors and falling electricity demand 69 lightwater reactors were cancelled from 1975 to 1982 in this country there has not been a single new order for a lightwater reactor in this country since 1978 while there are several reasons why nuclear orders have been cancelled it remains true that the major justification for breeder technology is valid only if uranium to supply lightwater reactors is no longer available at a reasonable price what we find however when we examine the status of uranium supply and price is that the estimates regarding both supply and price for uranium were greatly underestimated when the need for early commercialization of breeder technology was first conceived in 1974 it was estimated by the federal government that there was 1 7 million pounds of proven and probable reserves of uranium which is about enough to fuel 340 lightwater reactors over their lifetime in 1980 the department of energy reported that there is actually about 3 5 million pounds of proven and probable reserves of uranium or enough to fuel 700 lightwater reactors over their lifetimes the latest estimates from the department of energy further reflect that we will probably have about 165 lightwater reactors operating by 2000 and 285 by the year 2020 accordingly early commercialization of breeder technology cannot be justified on a basis of a shortage of uranium supply now let us examine the price of uranium uranium is the only nonrenewable fuel whose price has declined since 1979 when the last hike in opec oil prices occurred currently uranium is selling for about 18 per pound a recent los alamos study found that the price of uranium would have to reach 185 per pound before breeder reactors could be competitive with lightwater reactors according to does own figures such a uranium price will not be reached until well into the next century therefore on the basis of uranium price early commercialization of breeder technology cannot be justified there are other problems with the clinch river project which should send a signal of caution against further support for this project a recent analysis by the general accounting office has indicated that the final cost for construction and operation of the crbr may ultimately reach 11 billion this estimate should not be taken lightly or easily dismissed by any of us during a time of severe fiscal restraint while the point is often made that some of our european friends are proceeding with a breeder commercialization program the fact that these programs are experiencing serious cost overruns is ignored it might indeed represent a preferable strategy for our nation to learn from the mistakes of our european friends while continuing to advance the state of basic research on nuclear technology i support a strong and aggressive energy program for our country but i believe this program must be a balanced one we must support energy efforts to insure that we can burn coal more cleanly to develop synthetic fuels to advance solar energy to implement energy conservation and to improve the efficiency and operation of our lightwater reactors in the short and mid term as was recently pointed out in a washington post article nuclear power isnt scarythese reactors are by s david freeman director of the tennessee valley authority what we should be doing is fundamentally reexamining the nuclear option is there an inherently better technical option than the apparently unforgiving reactor design we have today freeman goes on to point out that we need more research into modifications of the basic lightwater reactor designs such as has recently occurred in sweden and in other alternate reactor concepts such as the hightemperature gascooled reactor this member of congress is deeply concerned that if we concentrate our resources on crbr we will not be able to explore these other nuclear options that may be capable of breathing some life back into a dying nuclear industry over the long term i believe we must continue to pursue basic research in breeder technologywhich would not be cut by this amendment todaydevelopment of fusion energy and research into advanced solar utilizations the decision regarding which one or ones of these longterm energy sources will be adopted for future use is not ready to be made commercialization of breeder technology is prematureand crbr is the first step to commercialization i urge you to have the insight to terminate this illadvised project today before we indeed are too far down the road to turn

policy are interwoven measures whiich will insurc that we have addresscd each of the severe dislocations which threaten our economic future there can be no doubt that we arc facing an increasingly severe economic crisis federal spending taxes and inflation have exploded in recent years and the federal government has been one of the major detonators in 1970 federal budget authority was 212 billion by the end of the decade it had surged to 568 billion or 23 percent of the gross national product unfortunately revenues have not kept up with runaway spending consequently the federal budget was in deficit every year of the past decade in 1970 the deficit was a modest 2 8 billion in 1980 it was nearly 60 billion these annual deficits have caused our total national debt to more then double in the past decade going from some 400 billion in 1971 to nearly 1 trillion today it cost this country 73 billion last year just to pay the interest on this trillion dollar debt obviously this profligate spending must stop but it is not easy to bring to a halt the lumbering voracious giant know as the federal budget one of the greatest obstacles to fiscal discipline is the problem of entitlements spending mandated by law or contract the share of the budget taken by entitlements has grown by two thirds in the past 14 yearsfrom 36 percent in 1967 to 59 percent today with 16 percent of the budget going to borrowing authority guaranteed loans and off budget agencies less than 25 percent of the budget remains in direct control of congress one need only look at some of these programs to understand how massive and uncontrollable the entitlement problem has become food stamp costs have doubled in the past 3 years from 5 2 billion in 1979 to 10 3 billion in 1981 six million americans were added to the food stamp roles in that period so 23 million people or 1 out of 10 americans now participate in the program medicaid is another disturbing example costs of medicaid rose from 5 2 billion in 1970 to 29 billion in 1981 an average of over 1 300 is spent annually on each medicaid recipient uncontrolled federal spending is a problem in itself but it creates an additional problem namely inflation lax monetary policies have resulted in a climate of continuing inflation inflation has grown from 1 percent per year in the early 1960s to nearly 13 percent in the last 2 years in december we saw record high inflation of 13 percent and shortterm interest rates of over 21 percent the basic necessitiesfood housing clothing and health carehave skyrocketed for example mortgage interest rates now average almost 15 percent and more than 90 percent of those who rent cannot afford to buy a home inflation also exacerbates the problem of high taxes inflation creates bracket creep whereby individuals are pushed into higher and higher tax brackets after receiving wage increases designed to offset inflation instead taxes offset the wage increase as taxes rise faster than inflation every 10 percent increase in income produces an astonishing 15 percent increase in federal personal income tax receipts federal personal taxes on each family have nearly quadrupled in the past 15 years growing from 1 500 for an average family in 1965 to 5 500 in 1980 you do not have to be an einstein to know that you cannot get ahead under such conditions given these conditions it is no surprise that savings rates have plummeted in the late 1960s and early 1970s americans save between 7 to 9 percent of disposable income in 1980 the rate had dropped to 5 percent this appalling rate of savings contributes to a serious shortage of capital needed for investment to improve productivity and promote longterm growth this country faces significant economic problems but they are certainly not insurmountable a plan must be adopted to reduce federal spending cut marginal tax rates provide relief from overregulation and maintain a predictable monetary policy grammlatta is such a plan the grammlatta bipartisan proposal contains 6 3 billion less in budget authority 6 1 billion less in outlays the same amount of revenues and a deficit 6 1 billion lowe than the reagan plan it is an effective bipartisan approach conversely the jones budget provides more of the same policies that created the economic quagmire the jones measure provides more spending than the bipartisan budget and substantially less tax relief in effect mk jones proposes to offer a lower deficit through higher taxres this is unacceptable some individuals have questioned the wisdom of the presidents tax cut proposal and would prefer to see a balanced budget before reducing taxes i think a few points need emphasis actually the president is not proposing to reduce federal taxes but only to reduce the rate of increase in taxes a gigantic tax increase is built into the system and the real question becomes one of reducing the amount of that increase without the presidents proposal federal tax receipts will increase some 308 billion over the next 3 years president reagan wants to cut that increase by 136 billion the president proposes to cut individual tax rates across the board for 3 years the tax cuts would be concentrated on the middle class taxpayers with net earnings of 10 000 to 60 000 now pay 72 percent of all personal taxes and would receive 73 percent of the benefits under the presidents plan the president would also allow faster writeoffs of investments on new plants and equipment the combined reduction of personal and business taxes will provide vital incentives to work save and invest because taxpayers will be able to keep more of the money they earn as this program returns economic autonomy to the taxpayer it also returns decisionmaking authority to the state and local level state and local governments will decide on their priorities what services to fund and how to deliver those services this in itself will produce savings and efficiency a number of people have expressed concern over the effect the cuts will have on the most needy i am acutely aware of these concerns because i come from one of the poorest states in the country in terms of per capita

prudently to protect the people of my state and of the nation but we must remember that our problems did not evolve overnight and they are not going to go away overnight this is the first step not the final solution but this first step is very important and we must take it now the plan is not written in stone it is likely that some adjustments will be necessary the program will be scrutinized closely but it has to be given an opportunity to work no one is hurt more by stagflation than the poor the elderly and those living on fixed incomes and no one will benefit more from reduced inflation

of this document i hope that will pause to reflect on the fact that we are going to fall flat on our face because a court is going to throw us out i say that because the lawyer who assisted us in drafting this resolution failed to include one of the most fundamental and indispensible words that any citation of contempt must have to go anywhere in a court proceeding and that word is willful it is a jurisdictional fact we have not said that ms gorsuch willfully failed to do anything we have just said she failed to do something and you cannot hold anybody in contempt unless you charge them with willful disobedience of an act within the jurisdiction of the person asserting the authority second let me tell the members how a judge or a justice of an appellate court is going to look at this record when we correct this resolution after we fail the first time the court will say counsel do you mean to tell me that the congress refused to look at 786 977 documents the citee produced and yet is attempting to hold the citee in contempt for falling to produce 23 more get out of here commonsense dictates that congress must first examine what is produced then assert that such documents have been examined and the unproduced are needed to complete its investigative function i am in opposition to this resolution which would cite the epa administrator as being in contempt of congress while recognizing that this institution has an important constitutional role in overseeing the implementation of the laws it has passed a delineation has to be made between constructive oversight over as opposed to counterproductive meddling in the implementation of such laws as a member of the energy and commerce committee i have some familiarity with this issue in that our committees oversight and investigations subcommittee has also requested documents pertaining to superfundalbeit a more reasonable numberand has been similarly denied what is important to remember is that this dential of documents is not so much an exercise of executive privilege as it is a claim of separation of powers neither the administrator nor the administration is claiming that certain documents should never be turned over instead what they are claiming and what should be of concern to every member of this houseis that should not be required to prejudice enforcement efforts while they are still in progress the argument may be made that you can not have effective oversight unless congress can see what kinds of enforcement activities are going on but the other side of that coin is if we can look into all that is on while it is going on we become a participant in the process and that is not what the founding fathers had in mind it was their intention that the executive branch enforce the law not the legislative branch as legislators our duty is to decide what the law should be and then if it does not produce the intended results to change it accordingly but in this case we do not know if the law has produced the desired results indeed it has only been in effect for a year and a half and it still has 3 years to run also it should be remembered that epa is willing to turn over a vast ma jority of the documents requestedall but 300 to 400 pages out of an astounding total of 787 000 the pages being withheld go beyond the realm of summarizing actions taken or not taken rather they involve legal analysis and possible legal strategies that might be pursued in the prosecution of the case as a lawyer i can share with my colleagues the thought that premature disclosure of such analyses and potential strategies would be most helpful to those suspected of noncompliancethe very people that i suspect the authors of this resolution would not want to see helped now i realize that none of my colleagues would ever think of leaking such information if it became known to them but then again capitol hill leaks are not unheard of so i do not think that it is any more unreasonable for the executive branch to try and protect itself against the premature disclosure of prejudicial information than it is for the legislative branch to try and obtain information essential to the fulfillment of its constitutional responsibilities that being the case i think this body should be seeking an accommodation that would balance the respective interests of the legislative and executive branches of government rather than promote a confrontation between them one of the reasons i suggest this is that epa has gone a long way toward providing the requested material another is that epa was not given very much time to do it indeed it is my understanding that the epa only had 8 days to comply with this subpena not a very long period considering how long it has taken this congress to pass appropriations bills considering how difficult it has been for this congress to meet budget deadlines and considering how many other environmental matters have been shuffled under the rug by this congress just looking at the record and comparing it with what is being requested here and one could conceivably wonder if this is not a way to distract public attention away from what this congress has not been doing of course i realize that no member of this august body would stoop so low as to put politics above principle in such a fashionor in any fashion for that matterbut surely there are other matters just as much in need of attention or more in need of attention than this right now clean air legislation has been stalled for almost 2 years now to cite one example and i am reminded that clean water legislation which was submitted to the public works and transportation committee early last summer has yet to be reported in any form what an irony for the public to behold a 22page clean water proposal cannot be marked up in 6 months but 787 000 pages of documents covering 160 hazardous waste sites should be produced in toto without regard to the sensitive nature of the contents within 8 days if this is not a case of the pot calling the kettle black i am not sure what is the real question isdo we have the courage to admit as much to ourselves and the nation if not is it any wonder congress continues to rate so low in the public opinion polls one additional point needs to be made just because congress has been lax in cutting spending and getting the nations fiscal house

increased again the local community was faced with the problem of providing an education for individuals whose families did not pay taxes recognizing their obligation to both the academy and the town in 1948 and 1949 the department of defense provided tuition payments for high school students from west point in 1950 a more or less longterm solution was established in the enactment of public law 81874 the impact aid act although many school districts in the country face some of the same problems of the highlands fallsfort montgomery school district there is a unique situation here that requires a special solution over 93 percent of the taxable land in the school district now belongs to west point the highland falls school district is the poorest in my new congressional district and the true property valuethe test of financial support from the communityis less than half of the average for new york state family income per student is 25 percent less than the state average the situation in highland falls is unlike that in annapolis or boulder the population is far less there is no tax base to support industry and there is no tourism in the town or village historically the town and village have depended on west point to a greater extent than any other area of the country west point controls so much land in the area that the communitys entire watershed is on army property nowhere else does a military establishment have such a strong hold on the life of a community since the expansion of west point property in the 1940s a serious problem has existed in the education of students of families at the military academy for the past 30 years impact aid has provided sufficient funds to educate secondary school students from west point but following the enactment of the reconciliation act last year the inevitable consequence of the reduction in federal aid has occurred even though the federal government owns over 90 percent of the land it is reducing its payment in lieu of taxes by 50 percent this fiscal year and by 10 percent in fiscal year 1983 further student aid under section 3 of the impact aid act has been reduced by 40 percent in 1982 and another 20 percent in 1983 this has resulted in a shortfall of over 200 000 for the highland fallsfort montgomery school district the effect of these reductions has been so great that in august of this year the local school board voted unanimously to bar secondary students from west point from entering the local high school if impact aid equal to the current tuition for each student was not forthcoming for the current school year this action was to have taken effect on october 5 1982 the board further voted to charge tuition to west point students to make up the difference between the shortfall in impact aid and current tuition needs now a complete shutdown of the school system is being seriously considered this problem must be resolved staff at the high school has been reduced by 20 percent the quality of education for both the local residents and the west point children will suffer significantly if the school is closed over 100 tuitionpaying students from the adjoining garrison school district across the river from west point are faced with increased costs to subsidize west point students and the school board has threatened to withdraw the garrison students if the contribution from the federal government is not increased immediately the department of education has refused to provide the 200 000 needed to keep the school open the view has been expressed that the department of defense should consider building its own high school just as it was forced to build its own elementary school more than 60 years ago such a facility would be a complete folly as the cost would far exceed the modest reimbursement necessary to keep the local high school open i cannot believe that experts in education would suggest the establishment of a high school at west point would be a healthy environment for army students the federal government has an obligation to pay for the land it took to expand west point and a commitment to its military to give them the best possible living corditions cutting off access to the local community would not enhance the quality of life at west point impact aid is at its lowest level in 10 years in the highland fallsfort montgomery school district payments received for land taken by the academy are below 1975 levels the academy is presently increasing its holdings by another 28 acres further eroding any potential chances to increase the local tax base relations between west point and the local community will seriously deteriorate if the situation is not improved soon i have been working with the department of education and the department of defense on this matter the future growth of our nations armed forces depends on giving military personnel adequate training housing and educationboth for themselves and their families west point is the nations oldest military academy it was an integral part of the defense of colonial forces in the upper hudson river during the revolutionary war nearby for nearly 2 years was the seat of our government and there the war came to an end west point has supplied uncounted heroes and leaders to this country in his speech to the graduating class at west point in 1981 president reagan recognized the importance of a selfreliant confident military the president noted that the quality of military life should exist above a bare subsistence level the president has sought and received increases in pay for the volunteer army he has constantly reiterated his commitment to building up our armed forces it is difficult to see how one can avoid the conclusion that the unintended effect of the reductions in impact aid has been to erode the selfimage and respect of the families at west point being faced with possible tuition charges or the barring of their children at the local high school due to the federal governments failure to meet its responsibilities is not the way to insure a continuing commitment to a military life by army personnel stationed at west point i am not asking for additional funds for the impact aid program or for this congress to go beyond the budget ceilings established earlier this year i am requesting that the appropriations committee in conjunction with the departments of education and defense take a close look at what money might be available as a line item in their budgets to avoid the drastic consequences of the closing of the high school in highland falls clearly we can better afford to provide the 200 000 necessary to keep the school open than we can risk the effect on the local community and west point families by further reducing aid constructing a high school at west point or letting this problem go unresolved december 1 if82"], [0.506708025932312, 0.506708025932312, 0, "i am today introducing legislation that would amend the powerplant and industrial fuel use act of 1978 by placing a ceiling on severance taxes a state can impose on coal produced from federal and indian lands the provisions of the coal severance tax limitation act of 1981 are identical to s 178 introduced by minnesota senator dave durenberoer on january 21 during the 96th congress i cosponsored similar legislation h r 6625 a bill introduced on february 28 1980 by congressman philrp r sharp that legislation was the subject of hearings by the interstate and foreign commerce committees energy and power subcommittee of which i was a member on march 21 and june 5 1980 h r 6625 was reported by the full committee on september 16 1980 h rept 961527 part 1 december 4 1980 the legislation i am introducing today differs from h r 6625 in that the scope of this bill is limited to coal produced from federal and indian lands while i hesitate to support federal legislation that deems to infringe on areas normally reserved to the states it does seem unfair for states that are blessed with extensive federal resources to excessively tax those resources and pass on those taxes to citizens of other states my legislation does not prohibit this kind of taxation rather it establishes a ceiling of 12 percent i recognize that the approach taken by my legislation could make illinois coal less competitive inasmuch as my legislation would tend to make western coal which now has severance taxes in excess of 12 percent more attractive to potential users of that coal illinois incidentally imposes no severance taxes on any of its energy resources i am also concerned that the establishment of a 12 percent ceiling could in effect become a floor on balance though i have concluded that it is unfair for illinois consumers particularly commonwealth edison ratepayers to pay higher utility bills as a result of high severance taxes on the low sulfur coal coined chooses to use i will continue to work to promote the production and utilization of high sulfur illinois coal particularly in connection with congressional consideration of the clean air act the conflicting views on coal severance tax limitation legislation are evident in two letters i received earlier this year first in a january 12 letter to me from commonwealth edison several reasons for supporting this kind of legislation are discussed reasons in opposition to this position are described in a june 29 letter to me from the illinois institute of natural resources which has since been renamed the illinois department of energy and natural resources the texts of these two letters are included at the end of my statement illinois consumers paid over 20 million in coal severance taxes to other states in 1979 they paid an additional 90 million in severance taxes on other energy resources to other states during the same period severance taxes by have states at the expense of have not states seem to create an inequity that i believe congress must address as a result of the july 2 1981 unitedstates supreme court decision in the commonwealth edison co against montana case the matter of state severance taxation on energy resources destined for shipment in interstate commerce is clearly an issue for the congress to address as a member of the energy and commerce committees subcommittee on fossil and synthetic fuels i commend subcommittee chairman sharp for beginning hearings this week on this subject particularly as one who was active during subcommittee and full committee consideration of this issue during the last congress i look forward to this issue being addressed during the 97th congress i insert the texts of the two letters mentioned earlier as well as the text of the coal severance tax limitation act

ani glad that you are one of the cosponsors of that bill because it is a very good piece of legislation for the entire country as you well know it would also be particularly helpful to the people we serve and you represent if h r 6625 had been law during 1980 our customers would have saved about 20 million which instead will go to pay severance taxes in montana and wyoming the majority report on the bill by the committee on interstate and foreign commerce is excellent it is factually accurate and properly explains the importance of enacting the bill the report explains how a few states by enacting excessively high severance taxes can thwart our national energy policy and can unfairly export the burden of taxation to the citizens of other states like illinois i think the majority report is responsive to the concerns expressed by congressman wirth in his minority opinion congressman wirths main argument is that coal production in montana has not declined since the enactment of that states 30 percenit severance tax he takes this as an indication that our national energy policy of developing coal resources has not been frustrated the majority points out that montana coal is usually bought under longterm production contracts while pre existing contracts will sustain the production levels cited by congressman wirth there have been few new contracts signed since the severance tax was passed the lack of new contracts shows how the montana tax has frustrated our national effort to reduce oil consumption the h 7804 amount which our customers will pay montana and wyoming 48 million last year and as much as 200 millon over the next five years demonstrates the unfairness of the situation congressman wirth suggests that the montana taxes paid by our customers represent only a small portion of their electric bills this is mainly the result of our ability to use nuclear power to supply so much of our customers needs it does not reduce the unfairness of the excessive state severance taxes included in the price of every kilowatthour we generate with montana coal if we are going to develop our national energy resources and free ourselves from reliance on foreign energy producers it is imperative that we prevent regionalism from interfering with national interests hr 6625 is a necessary step in that direction in your letter to me you also included a copy of your december congressional report i noticed several items in it of direct interest to us these are the discussion of the urgent need for a rational national policy on nuclear waste disposal which i discussed briefly in a separate letter to you written earlier today the discussion of the importance of promoting the use of illinois coal and your efforts to speed decisions in ferc wholesale

percent of the househols use natural gas for water heating 91 percent use it for space heating and 95 percent use it for cooling clearly the availability of natural gas is critical to the economic wellbeing and energy security of my state therefore i was alarmned by a recent report issued by southern california gas co stating that natural gas supplies currently available to southern california will not be sufficient to serve the area fully by the 1980s given this project shortfall the need to develop access to new supplies of natural gas is obvious our best potential new source of domestic natural gas is obvious our best potential new source of domestic natural gas is prudhoe bay on alaskas north slope the largest single finding of oil and natural gas proven reserves at prudhoe bay are estimated at 26 trillion cubic feet and represent about 13 percent of united states total proven gas reserves additional potential gas reserves on alaskas north slope left to be discovercd are projected at 100 to 200 trillion cubic feet the alaska national gas transportation system will provide access to these proven reserves equivalent to at least 400 000 barrels of oil per day with potential energy supplies of perhaps 10 times that amount the 4 800 mile pipeline will transport natural gas through alaska and canada to nearly every state in the union and will have an initial capacity to provide over 4 percent of our nations daily natural gas needs the angts will provide a stable and reliable supply of energy to this country a supply thant ill not be subject to opec embargoes or escalating prices at a projected total cost of 40 billion the pipeline will be the most expensive private construction project ever conceived last may the angts financing plan was presented to four unitedstates commercial banks for consideration in august the four bank group advised that although the project rould be privately financed without governmental guarantees and or participation certain steps must be taken to modify the financial requirements established under the 1976 alaska natural gas transportation act this act had specifically provided for the waiver of federal laws if necessary to facilitate success of the project the commercial banks told thle pipeline sponsors that unless these financial modifications or waivers wvere approved reliable private sector financing could not be secured for the project in other words the pipeline will not be built unless these waivers of law as proposed to congress by president reagan on october 15 and contained in senate joint resolution 115 are approved the most controversial provision of the waiver package is the one which would permit prebilling senate joint resolution 115 would permit billing of unitedstates gas consumers for the construction costs of the pipeline before the pipeline is fully operational the federal energy regulatory commission ferc would establish a date certain for expected completion of the entire project probably 1987 for the purpose of thle waiver the system wvould be divided into three segments canada alaska and the conditioning plant at prudhoe bay each of which would have specific billing schedules if any one or two of these three segments of the pipeline were completed before the entire pipeline but after the date certah consumers at the discretion of ferc could be prebilled for the completed segments the argument has been raised that this prebilling proposal would lock consumers into multibillion dollar payments whether or not the pipeline is ever completed this is simply not the case the prebilling provision of the waiver proposal gives ferc the discretionary power to allow companies decembet 10 1 981 planning to move gas through the project to begin billing gas customers first only after a date selected by ferc as reasonable completion of the entire system probably 1987 second only after full completion and testing of one of two of three basic segments of the line third only for the debt service and related costs on the unitedstates sements of the project fourth only after billions of dollars of the sponsors own risk capital has been invested without return until project completion and fifth only for those costs prudently incurred and actually paid the absolute worst case consumer financial risk a highly unlikely contingency of utter project failure after completion of the two most expensive segments of the system would involve average consumer payments of less than 1 per month during the 20 years required to discharge the debt in full one oil embargo or a revolution would add far more to consumer energy bills in contrast given a worst case scenarlo unitedstates private sponsors of the project would lose all their equity investment in such a case big business would be the big losersnot the consumers furthermore in the event of any delay beyond the date certain assuming ferc has approved the prebilling as just and reasonable any payments by consumers would serve to reduce and lower their later payments when the system is finished consumers would under no circumstances be asked to pay for sections of the system that are not completed approval of the waiver package also fulfills a national commitment to canada in july 1980 president carter informed prime minister trudeau that he would ask congress to allow the participating canadian companies to collect their full service costs upon completion of the canadian segment of the line in july 1980 congress expressed its unqualified support for the project in a formal resolution s con res 104 canadas national energy board relied upon this presidential and congressional support when it acted to permit new gas exports and construction of the prebuild segments in canada reneging on this commitment by not building the alaskan section of the pipeline would be extemely detrimental to relations with canada what the whole issue boils down to is this no waiver package means no pipeline without acceptance of the waiver package it will be impossible to obtain private sector financing for what is universally regarded as an invaluable and even essential project lack of private financing support would either lead to the projects abandonment or force outright government financing the only way to insure private sponsorship and funding of this

said about the merits of the unitedstates position on infant formula i have concluded as have many of my colleagues in the house that nothing could be more unfortunate than for our country to have come out against motherhood in third world countries and for what many perceiverightly or wronglyto be nothing less than child killing alh for the sake we are told of madison avenue free speech and greater corporate profits it would be my hope this afternoon that not only will the merits of the issue be probed carefully but so will the critical decisionmaking process itself how the final decision placing the new administration in such an insensitive position was determined needs to be carefully examined to insure that when issues of humanitarian and strategic importance to the united states arise in the future such as in the law of the sea negotiations national rather than corporate interests are given primary consideration it is an unfortunate fact that with nearly every administration there emerge revolving door scandals involving individuals who because of previous jobs or source of financial support ought not to be candidates for certain public offices and individuals who because of decisions made while in office should not accept certain positions in the private sector after leaving government we have laws on the books to prevent such conflictsofinterest but there are nevertheless those gray areas where the spirit of the law rather than the letter must dictate conduct as government has grown larger and intruded more deeply into private affairs the prosperlty of industry has become more dependent on governmental decisions the distinction thus between public duty and private gain has become increasingly blurred examples are abundant a former seeretary of agriculture failed to pay income taxes on speaking fees generated because of his former government position a former president sold a debtridden peanut warehouse to a company which munificently benefit ed from an exception to his administrations tariff policy that he himself authorized shortly before leaving office and in the infant formula case before us today the individual nominated to be assistant secretary of state for human rights advanced within the new administration the interests of an industry that helped pay his wages in the private sector it is always tragic when an administration is tainted by scandal particularly when an administration like this one is so committed to giving new direction and vigor to the nation but when decisions must be made on issues as important as infant formula marketing codes there must be no compromise on issues of character and conflictofinterest nor should there be any compromise on professional health standards the world health organization of which the united states is a member has a long tradition of being one of the least politicized international institutions in fact a proposal at a 1978 senate hearing was the impetus for bringing the issue of infant formula before the world health organization recognizing the health and medical expertise represented there was particularly well suited to dealing with the problem in the united states itself the american public health association has expressed firm support for the who infant formula marketing code and eminent health experts publicly decried the decision to oppose the code dr george silver professor of public health at yale university school of medicine stated there can be no debate about the lethal consequences of unrestricted use of these preparations in the impoverished developing world our top health official at aid resigned in a protest of conscience when the united states refused even to abstain notingthe united states has rightfully earned a high degree of credibility in the world health organization we have been in the forefront in the fight against diseaseby the quality of our science and ingenuity and by the extent and preseverance of our commitment to the goals of world health we are now about to throw away that credibility and to isolate ourselves on june 2 1981 an open letter was sent to secretary haig from five eminent united states health scientists from columbia university johns hopkins cornell berkeley and ucla expressing deep disappointment over the unitedstates vote and shock at being told that the administration in defending its vote is now suggesting that scientific evidence is lacking to relate inappropriate bottle feeding with high levels of infant morbidity and mortality they warned your department should not be a party to the dissemination of information that goes against scientific evidence tragically it would appear that professional health expertise in the united states was not a vital ingredient in the decisionmaking process on the unitedstates vote on the who code but blunders do not seem to be limited to the conflictsofinterest of an administration nominee and the callous disregard of professional health counsel reliable reports on internal decisionmaking within the administration suggest that professional diplomatic and foreign affairs experience was cast aside as well for the past 3 years the united states has been intimately involved with other who member governments unitedstates agencies industries and its cr es and professional groups in the international decisionmaking process on developing an international code for formula marketing the unitedstates government has previously supported world health assembly resolutions on breast feeding infant nutrition and the concept of an international code similar dialog was vigorously conducted within the united states among various federal agencies the formula industry health and nutrition professionals and private sector critics all of these preparations drew to a close this spring as the united states approached the 34th world health assembly a final round of agency discussions and consultations led to the conclusion that if a concensus on a yes vote was impossible within the new administration then at least concensus could be reached on an abstention a decision reached by top ranking state hhs and aid officials concluded that an abstention would be made provided two further moderating coucessions could be secured from the who again reliable sources report that the unitedstates delegation to geneva headed by assistant secretary elliott abrams was instructed by telegram to obtain the two desired concessions on the premise that the united states would then be in a position to drop its opposition to the code unfortunately after these negotiations commenced and despite their success the unitedstates delegation in geneva was instructed directly by the white house to end further unitedstates negotiatiofis and to vote no on the code thus it is clear that the administration in the decisionmaking process on infant formula policy compromised itself on all accounts it compromised on personal standards of government ethics and conflicts of interest it compromised itself on health expertise on which round health policy decisions must be based and it compromised itself on the diplomatic front by exposing itself to charges of bad faith negotiations after years of openly supportive and cooperative efforts with the who this decision can only bode ill for future unitedstates national interests in international negotiations all administrations take time to establish decisionmaking processes with which a new president can feel comfortable i would hope that the infant formula issue would become a case study in decisionmaking to ascertain whether refinements in the recently established process are in order i am particularly concerned that the white house political staff reportedly overrode professional advice from the health and international affairs institutions of our government an important question the administration should carefully consider is who key decisionmaking for important international issues should be in terms both of their relevant personal experience as well as their institutional assignments in this regard i was deeply disappointed this week to receive from the state department a policy assessment that concluded the decision to vote against the international code was a consensus decision reached at the highest levels of the white house policy staff the departments of state and hhs and the unitedstates mission to the u n this conclusion would appear to be either mischievously misleading or sheer fabrication the white house staff clearly went against the consensus reached within the departments where health and diplomatic expertise are posited to paint another picture simply does not fit the frame the american people voted last november for a new realism in foreign policy but nothing would be more disappointing than for important strategic concerns to be jeopardized by a narrow philosophical bias on humanitarian issues of this nature i urge adoption of this resolution as the least our government can do to correct an unfortunate and deeply consequential mistake"], [0.5062773823738098,

political party i think that is a fairly accurate summary on the one hand we have a serious effort to change economic conditions while on the other hand we have a continuing series of efforts to zigzag and maneuver least my colleagues think i am talking purely out of my personal beliefs as a partisan let me quote two leaders one initimately involved in the liberal democratic leadership the

years instead of 30 percent in 3 years is not coming half way it is coining onesixth way let me repeat that because i think it bears thinking about as a frame of mind i am quoting the gentleman from texas the democratic majority leader obviously 25 percent in 3 years instead of 30 percent in 3 years is not coming half way it is coming onesixth way it is as though halfway was between the gentleman from texas mr wrights position of zero and president reagans position of 30 percent i cannot really believe the gentleman from texas wanted no tax cut at all yet that is certainly the way his quote read on another date he said if the white house will insist on a 3year approach i am not sure we could sell this to most of the democrats but conceivably we might be able to half way 5 percent for 3 years or 5 percent for 1 year and then 7 percent and then stop and regroup i think that gives my colleagues a fair summary of the difference on the one hand there is an effort to bargain half way give 5 percent give 7 percent whatever will work on the other hand there is a serious fundamental effort to reexamine the entire process but the liberal leadership was in a dilemma they really could not come flat out against a popular president against a national movement against an effort to cut taxes that runs from california to massachuseets so they tried to hide behind a smokescreen i quote again and for the final time from the gentleman from texas the majority leader i am certain that most of them meaning democrats do not believe in the 3year tax cut they do not want it but a lot of the very same ones who do not believe in it nevertheless want to be perceived as supporting the president some democrats have been very upset some liberals have been very upset with this approach i want to

entitled his articfr rather eloquently the saeohe it mocrats he says in the face of the conservative ideological revival the democratic party has collapsed not just politically but morally he goes on further to say the moral humiliation is that the final program is worse for traditional democratic values than reagans initial plan the poor the working class and indeed the country would have been better off if the democrats had played no role at all in shaping the forthcoming tax and budget cuts mr kinsley describes the process i have talked about in recent days he says the progress of the tax bill since february has been even more startling someone ignorant of american politics observing the debate would assume that the democrats were quite literally the party of millionaires reagan amended his original proposal once in an attempt to get democratic support that version has passed the senate finance committee but last week the house ways and means committee passed its own version and the democratic leadership is planning an allout fight to avoid another defeat on the house floor the democrats proposed twoyear personal tax cut is skewed eversoslightly more toward moderate income people a matter of 45 to 00 for someone making under 30 000 they hope to get great political mileage out of this though the republicans are waiting in ambush with the message that their threeyear cut is bigger for every body in the end last night i guess we sprang that ambush by pointing out that the 3year cut is far betterfar betterthan the 2year cut which in fact by the third year becomes a tax increase the public has been confused in part because segments of the news media have frankly misreported have stacked the deck against our efforts for example if you look at the way in which time magazine printed the tax bill you get the senate finance committee for 1982 the house democrats for 1982 the senate finance committee for 1983 the house democrats for 1983 then you get the senate finance commnittee again but you do not realize because there is no further bar that in fact it is precisely in 1984 that the reagan program begins to draw away from to change the whole face of american politics and of american takehome pay for it is by that period that for example if you earn 15 000 this year you suddenly find that you are being left behind if you go for the rostenkowski tax increase that you are in fact falling further and further behind as your costofliving increase pushes you into higher brackets what you are getting in essence as mr kinsley said is an offer by the liberals to buy off your current desire to change the way we do business to change the kind of tax program that has continually raised the taxes for all of us raised it by 249 percent in the 1970s what thq liberals are trying to do is slow down that process just long enough so that we will forget what is happening and go about other business but the procesis they are using to slow that down is itself so distasteful so unacceptable that even many liberals are protesting let me quote again from mr kinsleys the shame of the democrats daniel rostenkowski democrat of il1inois chairman of the house ways and means committee is not going to sit idly by while the republicans give away millions why should they get all the credit he is determined to match every offer in the senate bill and raise them on a couple the question he said last week is whether you want to lose courageously or to win on the estate tax for example he outbid the republicans by adopting all their changes and adding a 28 percent tax cut for estates over 2 5 million the senate proposes a 2 500 credit against the windfall profits tax for oil royalty owners the windfall tax says the committee report may impose a hardship on many low and middleincome taxpayers no doubt it is some sort of hardship to pay 2 500 in taxes though this hardship is mitigated somewhat by up to 30 000 in oil revenues such a tax represents but why stop there in your concern for lowand middleincome taxpayers rostenkowski want to exempt a thousand barrels a day from the windfall tax this represents a cool 12 million a year per operator let me recap what mr kinsley a liberal democrat is saying is that the effort of the party of the common man the effort of people according to mr oneru who has a tax cut for those below 50 000 in fact involves a 28 percent tax break for estates of 2 5 million it involves a tax break of 12 million per year per operator according to mr kinsley surely not the common man unless"],

nations most important and largest industry is sincerely appreciated i also wish to thank my minority colleagues and all my colleagues in the committee for their help and dedication through the year i join the chairman in giving this agriculture appropriation bill for 1983 strong support the committee has done its best to bring a bill before the house that is not a budget buster and which complies with the budget resolution cbo estimates that h r 7072 is 2 7 billion below the committee section 302 b allocation on budget authority and 2 5 billion below on outlays the committee expects that these amounts will be needed to fully fund the nutrition assistance programsfood stamps child nutrition and wic we have funded these programs at less than full year levels in anticipation of administration supplemental requests sep ber21 1989 h 7320 co to comply with the budget resolution assumptions since the depression there has not been a time when a strong agriculture appropriation bill is needed more agriculture is experiencing its 3d straight year of falling income the usda recently announced its estimate of 1982 agricultural income at 19 billion down from 19 6 in 1981 and 24 4 in the cost price squeeze continues with prices paid by farmers increasing while their incomes have fallen farm indebtedness is 12 times higher than farm incomethe highest ratio ever on top of poor commodity prices borrowing power is being eroded by decreased land values for the first time in 30 years as of june 1 33 9 percent of the loans by farmers home administration were delinquent i will not go on but i could what is most important for me to get across is that the agricultural industry must recover if we are to expect recovery in the rest of the economy being larger than the auto steel and housing industry combined and with more workers than any other industry agriculture has a very large impact on the general economy a recent study completed by chase econometrics shows that full recovery cannot be achieved without recovery in the agricultural sector the study shows that depressed farm prices are causing a national loss of 2 2 billion in gross national product 4 billion in disposable personal income and 2 8 in net farm exports contrary to other industries agriculture is not undercapitalized or suffering from a decline in productivity rather it is a victim of its own sucuess our food production capacity is the envy of the world it provides the basis for american consumers to spend less of their disposable income on food than any other group of people in the world however when our production is greater than demand it means bad times on the farm and ranch one note about our abundance and that is to say that supply is only large relative to demand anyone who is knowledgeable about our international market will agree that this industrys marketing bare has been ruined by embargo after embargo and the food weapon has been used at considerable detriment to our demand side of the marketing cquation the small amount of funds provided in this bill for agricultural programs is needed to help repair embargo market damage and protect our most important natural resourcethe food producing capacity of american agriculture the committee provides 1 023 billion for agriculture research and extension activities this is 34 million more than last year and demonstrates our commitment to maintaining the critical scientific work that has been probably the most important factor in expanding our production and efficiency science must now play a leading role in finding new uses for our products pioneering less expensive methods of production developing systems that do a better job of preserving our soil and water resources and delivering that know how to the producers through our cooperative research service for protection of plants and animals from pests and disease the committee has provided 268 milliondown slightly from last yearbut at adequate levels to continue the battle against disease and pests the committee has decided to restore funding for such control programs as goldern nematode grasshopper gypsy moth imported fire ant witchweed and several other important programs that have proven effective over the years rural development through the activities of the farmers home administration is funded at levels that will allow the department to maintain or in some cases increase its participation levels we have provided the request for higher fmha operating loan levels to see that producers have more adequate access to last resort lending during these hard times the rural electrification administration is continued at virtually the same levels as last year rea has provided a critical link in facilitating the modern and efficient agriculture we see today it has also improve the living standard of our rural population if it were not for past rural electrification programs our rural people would not enjoy the conveniences of modern day living in an effort to halt our very serious land and water erosion problem our committee has restored as we are forced to every year the funds for conservation and forestry efforts almost every major publication in this country has run stories on our critical erosion situation our intensive farming practices and push for volume to make up for low prices has agrivated the loss of our farmland producers cannot bear the expensive erosion control measures by themselves it is to societys benefit that everyone join in the effort to preserve our natural resource base as my chairman has said so many timesall real wealth is linked to the soil and if we destroy that resource we are destroying our foundation as i mentioned earlier the food and nutrition programs that provide the needed assistance for lowincome americans are also funded in this bill the committee has only provided the presidents original request for the food stamp child nutrition and women infants and children programs however we have stated clearly in our report that these programs are to be administered at budget resolution assumption levels and that the committee hasample room under our 302 allocation for the supplemental requests needed to fund these programs for the full year it is clearly not the intention of the committee to ignore the budget resolution h r 7072 also funds the international agricultural programs the foreign agriculture service will be receiving 3 million more in 1983 than in 1982 the primary function of this organization is to help american agriculture in maintaining and expanding foreign markets for agricultural products so vital to the economic wellbeing of the nation i and the entire committee remain very concerned about our lack of an effective way to combat the loss of our overseas markets other exporting countries are using every means available to export their surplus eating away at our markets and eroding the earning potential of our own producers one of the reasons our producers were able to take advantage of in creased demand for grain during the 1970s was the fact that we had been operating 6 strong public law 480 concessional sales and food donation program ip addition usda operated a very successful direct loan program for financing export sales these programs were used for market development and gave us the leading edge that allowed the united states to capture most of the world grain and vegetable oil market the committee believes that now is the time to revive a direct credit export program our carryover supplies of wheat feed grain soybeans and dairy products has reached unmanageable levels we can no longer sit back and hope that the export situation will change or that some disaster will increase demand for our products the export credit program funded out of ccc existing authority at 500 million will help get rid of our products by offering terms and conditions more favorable than commercial lenders if used in conjunction with funds provided in the budget reconciliation measure this program could be very effective in raising commodity prices by reducing inventory and could also reduce government price support assistance in summary i urge my colleagues to consider the plight of agriculture recognize that to the committees and cbos best estimate we are under our targets set by the committee under the budget act and that we are bringing you a bill that when analyzed carefully does not exceed the budget and provides ample room for needed supplementals in the feeding program areas i ask your supjortand urge you to vote in favor of h t 7072"], [0.5062395930290222, 0.5062395930290222, 0, "i rise in enthusiastic support of this bill it is my firm belief that this legislation will do a great deal to bolster public confidence in the future of our depository instituions h r 6267 expands and more clearly defines the powers of the federal regulators of depository institutions in consultation with the state regulators to arrange mergers of troubled thrift institutions and of troubled commercial banks larger than 500 million and to provide assistance to facilitate them mergers are expected to be a last resort however when mergers must be arranged every effort will be made to preserve the specialized character of these institutions as providers of credit to housing and to the local economy the likelihood that mergers will be necessary is drastically reduced by the net worth assistance provisions for depository institutions which have encountered difficulties as a result of their efforts on behalf of housing the program is modeled after the alternative to the house bill which the federal home loan bank board developed and which i offered on the floor with the support of the administration institutions with net worth of 3 percent of assets or below will receive net worth certificates from the fdic or fslic in exchange for promissory notes consistent with the objectives which i sought to achieve when the house considered this legislation the net worth certificates may be treated as net worth consistent with generally accepted accounting principles moreover since the extent of coverage of an institutions losses varies according to its net worth70 percent for institutions with net worth of 01 percent 60 percent for institutions with net worth of 12 percent and 50 percent for institutions with net worth of 23 percent this preserves an incentive for managements to control losses and to return to profitability institutions will not be required to sign merger agreements or to replace management if they have net worth greater than 0 5 percent after receiving assistance and have reasonable prospects for longterm viability the recent decline in interest rates has been of tremendous value to thrift institutions struggling to survive the likelihood that institutions will ever have to be merged or have to avail themselves of net worth assistance is further reduced as a restilt of the array of new powers which the bill provides to depository institutions both on the liabilities side and on the assets side as a representative of columbus ohio which has been in the forefront of changes in the financial services market with the introduction of the cash management account by merrill lynch and bank one and with the recent introduction of financial services in a kroger supermarket in grove city i have been acutely aware of the need for depository institutions to have a depository instrument with which to compete under this bill both commercial banks and thrift institutions will be permitted to offer a new deposit instrument designed to enable them to compete with money market mutual funds and with the other competitors i mentioned although the full details must be determined by the depository institutions deregulation committee the bill calls for an instrument which could have a maturity as long as 5 years with a minimum denomination no higher than 5 000 and no interest rate ceiling or differential reserves would be set at only 3 percent and liquidity would be assured by permitting up to three preauthorized payments and up to three checks each month in addition the bill authorizes thrift institutions to offer checking accounts to customers with whom they have business relationships and permits depository institutions to offer now accounts to state and local governments on the assets side thrift institutions will be permitted for the first time to have up to 10 percent of their assets in commercial loans by january 1 1984 numerous other new asset powers are provided and management is given authority to arrange portfolios to suit the needs of individual institutions rather than forced to maintain specific baskets with severe restrictions these new powers are designed to give thrift institutions the opportunity to improve their earnings and solidify their market positions in order to continue to provide financing for housing in addition the bill clarifies the status of dueonsale provisions in resider tial mortgages by establishing cutoff dates after which institutions may enforce these clauses and a window period during which it will be up to the states to determine enforceability thus a major source of uncertainty has been removed from the mortgage market and commercial banks thrift institutions and realtors should be poised to resume lending when housing demand and longterm interest rates improve further the bill also contains an amendment which i offered extending from april 1 to july 1 1983 the period during which the federal home loan mortgage corporation will refrain from requiring institutions to enforce dueonsale clauses on mortgages sold to it it is also noteworthy that the bill significantly augments the authority of commercial banks to invest in service corporations by permitting them to conduct any activities through service corporations which they may conduct either through the banks themselves or through subsidiaries of bank holding companies i believe it is important to note that the administration has expressed great concern over the prospect that this particular new authority may permit banks to engage in activities such as underwriting and dealing in securities which would blur the traditional distinctions between banking and commerce established under the glasssteagall act i share the administrations concern that this development should not occur until congress has had an opportunity to examine fully the public policy issues raised by the continuing erosion of the separation between banking and commerce this same concern is reflected in the statement of managers which calls upon the federal home loan bank board to withdraw and take no further action on its proposed regulations which would authorize savings and loan service corporations to engage in the securities business and in other heretofore prohibited activities perhaps the study of deposit insurance provided under this bill will provide a forum for early consideration of appropriate means to assure the continued safety and soundness of depository institutions and to provide protections for consumers against conflicts of interest which are inherent in the engagement of a single entity in both banking and commerce i am also gratified that the bill also contains a provision designed to restrict the further expansion of property and casualty insurance activities by bank holding companies h r 6267 also provides credit union managers with needed authority to modernize their operations and provides relief for officials of commercial banks from onerous and unrealistic restrictions upon their ability to borrow from their own institutions to meet personal needs may i say while i am on my feet it has been a real privilege to have worked on this legislation with the very able chairman of our banking committee
