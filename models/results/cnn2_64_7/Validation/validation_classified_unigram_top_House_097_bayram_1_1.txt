is a result of a schedule slip in the space shuttle program in 1978 the congress directed the navy to lease future communications satellite service rather than continuing to build its own fleet satellite communications fijtsatcom system which was about to enter service in response to that direction the navy awarded a competitively negotiated contract to obtain satellite communication service to the fleet on a lease basis as a followon to the fltsatcom program under the terms of that contract the contractor is responsible for construction and launch of satellites that would satisfy navy requirements after successful launch and deployment the navy would then purchase the communication services provided by the satellites on entering into the leased satellite or leasat contract it was understood that the space shuttle would be available as a launch vehicle in early 1982 and the contractor designed leasat for shuttle launch only based on the shuttle schedule that was in existence in 1978 since that time the shuttle has incurred an extensive delay and the first leasat launch is now scheduled for may 1984vice april 1982 as originally planned this has caused a significant change in the contractor financing arrangement the contractor has stopped production efforts on the leasat and has placed the program in a caretaker status lengthy discussions and negotiations between the secretary of the navy and the contractor have led to a tentative agreement for modification to the existing contract to implement revised terms if a mutually agreed shuttle schedule and service requirements for satellite communications can be reached by november 1 1981 contract modifications being considered include a redistribution of payments to accommodate financing requirements but with no increase in total program cost additionally the navy will be given attractive lease buy options for service beyond the original 5year period and flexibility in launch dates to execute the terms of the contract modification the navy requires 87 million by november 1 1981 for the contract modification to be implemented this is 59 million above the amount already included in the fiscal year 1982 budget request for operations and maintenance funds for the leasat program the current fiscal year 1982 budget request for 8 million reflects the funds originally considered to be required under the existing contract in order to effect these payments an additional 59 million must be authorized forfiscal year 1982 in the operations and maintenance account title iii of our bill the committee will propose a companion amendment to title iii to take care of the leasat funding shortfall when title iii is opened to amendment this amendment will not increase the amount authorized for navy operations and maintenance as a result of this significant slip in the leasat program the navy is we riously concerned about future availability of satellite communication service and the potential adverse impact on military operations it this service is not available over the years the navy has become increasingly dependent on communications satellites as has the entire department of defense landbased communication facilities have been drawn down in order to decrease the cost of operations reduce american military presence overseas and to improve worldwide defense related command control and communications this reliance on communication satellites goes to the very heart of the need to preserve a robust fleet satellite communication system a system that currently serves both tactical and strategic users this navy concern is shared by the unified and specified commanders the joint chiefs of staff and the air force even though the initial successful test of the space shuttle has increased hopes that the leased satellite system leasat will ultimately be put in service the administration believes that the fleet satellite or fltsat system must be continued as an insurance policy for a variety of reasons including strategic force requirements the military services current satellite communication capability is based on the five fleet satellites that were authorized prior to the direction to lease satellite communication service although the fleet satellite program was based on a satellite design life of less than 4 years the navy hopes it can obtain as much as 6 years of service from these same satellites this optimism is based on the excellent service and technical characteristics displayed by the four fleet satellites that are currently on orbit even with this potential longer life and without the always possible catastrophic satellite failure or the possible launch failure of the fifth fleet satellite in august of this year the navy would need to launch an additional satellite not later than may of 1985 to continue a viable military commnunications system worldwide if leasat service were not available because of space shuttle related or other difficult es to support such a launch date the only reasonable course would be the continuation of the proven vltsatcom program satellites to protect this option long lead materials need to be ordered in fiscal year 1982 in this context the procurement of three additional satellites would protect the militarily essential foursatellite constellation which provides for defensewide tactical requirements and sf1 ategic coverage long lead material for these satellites in the amount of 65 million would have to be placed on contract in early fiscal ye ar 1982 to execute this plan the need for such an insurance policy would of course become more pressing if the launch of the fifth fltsatcom satellite which is already procured and now scheduled for launch in august of this year were to be unsuccessful i believe it is important to continue the fleet satellite program i therefore request support for this amendment that provides the 65 million that is required to procure the long lead materials needed to protect the option to launch additional fleet satellites beginning in 1985 since the committee recommends a reduction of 70 2 million in navy missile procurement this addition would still leave the recommended authorization 5 2 million below the request for navy missiles and the total authorization in the bill1 380 2 million below the presidents request"], [0.49339205026626587,

program in the bill for the past 3 weeks those of us from agriculture districts and agriculture backgrounds have tried to explain to other members the importance of having a strong farm bill that will help farmers receive a fairreturn for their commodities october 22 1 981 co~ american agriculture is one of the most productive industrics in the world we are able to feed this entire country and export grain to many parts of the world american agriculture is so efficient because of the family farm the 1981 farm bill will not help the family farmer unless loan rates are increased dairy price supports are adjusted upward and a sugar program is inicluded o rorm must be in any final 1981 farm bill the congress approves if they are not american agriculture will not be as strong and as productive as it can be in a world of hungry people who desperately need our food fifty years ago this country and particularly the farm economy was in the middle of the worst economic crisis ever known the great depression of the 1930s farms were foreclosed on people went hungry and the country suffered i hope we have learned enough over the years to avoid making the same mistakes that caused the great depression and pa arly i hope that we will pass a ivmw farm bill that will not further hurt american agriculture we have the opportunity to enact good agriculture policy for farmers consumers and the country i urge my colleagues to consider this as we move toward passaae of the 1981 farm bill at the same time i would also hope that my collegues would realize that farmers must pay whatever the going price is for equipment seed herbicides and feed while they have absolutely nothing to say about the market price for these reasons it is necessary for congress to have some say in how low farm prices are allowed by having a decentloan rate iwould like unanimous consent to enter into the racorw a statement by dale fast in the sturgis journal on saturday july 11 1981 that best sums up the farm situation the statement follows far~ms now h~s a paayer communications between the farmer and his city friends is a constant challenge the grass on the other side of the fence always looks greener but when we get over there we find its just as hard to mow our city friends dont understand the farmers plight and the farmer sometimes doesnt understand that his city cousin has problems too the fanner is a patient man patient determined and proud he has to be patient hell lose crop and come right back next spring with a grin and an 80hour week he battles the weather and machinery breakdown to get the crop planted he spends hundreds of dollars per acre for seed fertilizer and pesticides knowing full well that frost or drought may get it and if not the bugs willand if there is any left a haill storm will probably finish it off so he has to be a patient and determined person to be a farmer but there are some things he just doesnt understand ive seen wall plaques for the housewife golfer and even one for a sunday afternoon driver perhaps we need a prayer for the farmer to help him understand it might go something like this help me to understand lord why a person will pay 1 50 for it four ounce drink in a bar and say oimne another one but you charge him 1 85 for a whole gallon of milk and hell say boy thats expensive help me to understand why a japanese autoworker will pay 17 00 for a lb of steak in a grocery store and a unitedstates auto worker who draws wages of 8 00 per hour more than the japanese worker will look at steak in the meat counter at 3 25 per pounds and hell shake his head and say food costs are just too high and help me to understand lord why when i borrow 5 000 to paint my barn and put a new roof on my house the tax assessor raises my taxes even though 1 dont have any more equity in the place and maybe lord you can help me to understand why some people shake their heads when a farmer pays for power steering and air conditioning on his tractor which he uses 12 to 14 hours a day in a hot dusty field when they buy the same thing on an automobile to drive down a smooth blacktop road for less than an hour a day and lord help me to understand why the weeds always grow the fastest in my corn field at a time when my city cousin says the fish are biting the best and invites me to go along fishing on his weekends off or after he gets out of work at 3 30 and could you help me understand how the raccoons know exactly when to raid my sweet corn patch the night before i think its ready for the freezer and please help me to understand why the output per worker in our factories has gone down to a point that unit labor costs have doubled in the last five years while efficiency of the american farmer has increased to a point where each farmer feeds himself and 07 other people and oh yes lord with half of the worlds population going to bed hungry every night i just cant understand why people arent more thankful that our main problem in the usa is why cant i stay on my diet with so much food on the table now im not complaining lord rm used to hard work and disappointment but ive read in my favorite book that you also had trouble with human nature at times when you were here and i will ha so grateful it you can help my understanding in these matters about which i am so eonfused"], [0.4937629699707031,

house can support it is well within the budget constraints placed upon the subcommittee it is the best that we can do to assist the american farmer every one of us knows that it is not enough it is not going to be adequate we are also constrained by the authorizing legislation that does not permit us to do what many of us feel ought to be done on behalf of the grain farmers of this nation we understand the supluses that are developing we also know that the levels of price supports in this bill are inadequate that even established growers and producers are going to be in hard times i also predict that by next year probably about february or march you are going to see a concerted effort on both sides of the aisle to develop a farm program that will be meaningful that will assure that rural america does not go bankrupt along with urban america i rise in complete support of h r 7072 the bill making appropriations for the department of agriculture and related agencies for fiscal year 1983 i firmly believe that this bill represents the best judgment of our subcommittee as to how limited federal funds should be spent to best serve the interests of americas farmers i want to compliment our distinguished chairman the gentleman from mississippi for his most skillful leadership only a man who has experienced so much as chairman of the subcommittee and now the full committee could provide sufficient leadership to respond to the problems facing us in the fiscal 1983 budget i also want to compliment our ranking minority member the gentlelady from nebraska for her excellent cooperation in bringing forth what is truly a bipartisan bill and not simply one that is called bipartisan because of the coincidental sponsorship of legislation by members of the two different major political parties this bill is more than 3 billion below our subcommittees target under our section 302 b budget allocation it is more than 3 billion below the fiscal 1982 appropriation and we are still nearly 17 million below the presidents request fcr fiscal 1983 despite the fact that many of our priorities differ greatly from those of the president and despite the fact that one may view his budget request as an improper request because it failed to request funding based on current law but preferred to request funding based on changes in the law that the president would like to see our committee cannot make those changes and we must deal with the budget based upon what current law tells us to do in order to correct this problem in the future our committee report directs the department to provide its budget justification to us for fiscal 1984 and subsequent years based upon current law not a wish list of legislative provisions that no administration has ever fully expected to be adopted our farmers are hurting farm income is at its lowest adjusted level since the depression farm prices continue to decline interest rates make it impossible for farmers to get sufficient credit to continue their operations more and more farmers are finding it essential to have offfarm income sources in order to continue to live at a reasonable standard our price support programs have been changed and i fear that many of these changes have been in the interest of the office of management and budget not the american farmer some of these policy changes lack sufficient credibility to convince any reasnaable person that they are intended to help our farmers through these very tough times which have only gotten worse for them within the last 2 years it is for reasons such as these that our spending priorities within this bill must differ from those of president reagan we must deal with the situation as we find it not as we might like it to be we must be sure that adequate agricultural research is continued so that we can find new ways to help farmers reduce costs until such time that a more reasonable price for their commodities might be obtained we must be sure that the extension service is able to continue to adequately serve our farmers so that they will know that new techniques are available in farming which will help them to reduce their costs and improve their yields we need to be sure that adequate credit is available from the farmers home administration so that farmers can continue to weather our economic storms and that the policies of fmha truly recognize the problems our farmers face our committee is not convinced by administration officials who say that fmha is treating our farmers fairly too many farmers have complained to us about the lack of consideration given to them by fmha officials and the increased efforts to either foreclose or otherwise force farmers off fmha credit assistance for us to believe that those fmha policy officials who testified before our subcommittee are being totally honest with us and while i know that the title iii feeding programs funded in this bill are not necessarily the most popular items within this bill i think that it is essential that our bill continue to provde adequate food program assistance so that the literally millions of americans who are unable to find work will know that they will continue to be able to at least obtain a modest meal in their times of need i truly wish that we did not have to spend so much money on our feeding programs but if the need is there then so must be the funds with unemployment at historic levels i think it is pure folly to say that we are spending too much on these programs they are supposed to require large amounts of funds when americans are in trouble and with unemployment in my home state of michigan significantly above the national rate there is no question in my mind that many americans are facing trouble i would like to highlight certain provisions of this bill for the benefit of my colleagues who may not have had an opportunity to fully review it it is a good bill and one that deserves the support of every member of this body who cares about the condition of american agriculture title i provides funding for the basic agricultural programs of the department of agriculture one of its chief features is that this is where one will find funding for research and extension programs which i already described as two of the essential elements for the restoration of a healthy american agriculture president reagan wants to tell us that we need to give greater credence to the capability of states to determine what is in their best interest i agree that in certain respects states can do a more adequate job of recognizing their own needs and it is for this reason that i have been a strong supporter of the cooperative research service our bill provides an increase of nearly 9 million over fiscal 1982 for this agency which provides the bulk of its funding to state agricultural colleges through the hatch act formula research grant program under this program our agricultural colleges are given a share of funds to use on research projects that are of particular significance within each of the states frequently this research has a multistate application and the agency is doing a commendable job of attempting to keep all of our agricultural college researchers apprised of what projects all other institutions are conducting so as to avoid any unnecessary duplication of research efforts this pool of funds is the strongest method available of responding to ongoing problems that may be unique to a particular region of the countrywhich might not get the attention of usda researchers whose perspective might be a bit broader than significant regional problems ne provided an increase of 4 8 million over the presidents request in this program so as to provide a more realistic increase that could withstand the higher costs of conducting research the total increase in this program as a result will be slightly more than 8 million in fiscal 1983 we once again have found it necessary to restore several special grant projects that the presidents budget deleted in failing to recognize the significant need for these projects a number of these projects have particular relevance to michigan and i would like to briefly describe them to you first we provide 97 000 to continue work at the saginaw valley bean and beet research farm this facility has been jointly funded by the federal government the state of michigan and the michigan dry bean industry in a cooperative fashion since fiscal 1b78 the funding has resulted in the conduct of research activities crucial to dry bean and sugar beet growers in michigan and throughout the midwest the bill provides a 15 000 increase over the amount provided in fiscal 1982 to reflect certain expansion at the saginaw facility the money is intended to be used to help conduct this increased actvity and is expected to be used in a fashion conducive to the best management of the variety of research projects that need to be done we also iave restored funds for the dairy photoperiod project which is conducted at michigan state university as well as the funds for the bean flour research project which has been conducted jointly by michigan state and texas a m universities these two projects stem from the basic principle of doing more with the resources currently available dairy production can be modified through the use of photoperiod techniques in a manner which will allow producers to make temporary modifications in the milk production of their herds without going through the more difficult efforts of actually modifying herd size the bean flour project looks at ways of using the highly nutritious dry bean in a new form so as to increase both the availability of high protein food items and the market for dry bean products we also restored funding to continue research work on blueberry shoestring virus a disease that is creating great difficulties for michigans blueberry producers once again we have cut the funds for the competitive research grant program this program does accomplish meaningful research projects but the issue in my opinion has always been whether or not competitive grants are a superior method of administering research than the regular contract grant method of usda which already involves peer review utilizing usda personnel once again the department failed to answer this question to my satisfaction and it is this dispute coupled with the need to provide a more realisitic increase in hatch funding that led us to cut the program substantially below the presidents request there are two items of special interest within the budget of the agricultural research service first the bill identifies up to 100 000 to be used for recombitant dna research on soybean varieties this project can be very helpful in the development of new diseaseresistant varieties of soybeans and the money identified within the bill is intended as startup funds and will certainly be reviewed as part of the fiscal 1984 budget ^ second the report directs usda to retain any unexpended funds for the toxicology research project while a decision is made as to the future of usdas role in food toxicology research i am very pleased that we were able to do as well as we did with funding for the operations of the extension service this agency does more to help farmers stay current with the latest developments in agriculture than any other agency and is deserving of strong support the president did not provide for any increase in basic smithlever funds which keep our coopdrative extension efforts going our subcommitte however provided an increase of 11 000 000 so that efforts could continue without interruption or reduction while at the same time we restored funding fo other important extension activities such as farm safety peat management and urban gardening these efforts are modest but they are essential we need to keep our priorities straight and extension is one of our priorities we also made some significant restorations within the animal and plant health inspection service i am very wleased that we were able to restore 17 9 million for brucellosis eradication the budget presumed that the problem was no longer significant enough to merit continued funding and adopting that rivcommendaton would almost certainly have meant that all of the progress made in reducing brucellosis would be lost for years to come the restoration is targeted toward the most critical problem areas again emphasizing the point that we are trying to use fedral dollars as prudently as possible we also restored funding for the animal welfare act the administration wanted to turn over enforcement activities to states and private grour i but during our hearings the agency admitted that such a transfer of authorities could not be done under the law and failure to provide a restoration would probably mean a substantial increase in the number of violations of the act this item may not again seem to be the most important within this bill to a number of people but it addresses the critical issue of the humane treatment of animals a subject of great interest to both farmers who provide excellent care for their own farm animals and pet owners who depend upon the assurances of pet shops that the animals they are purchasing are healthy within funds for the statistical reporting service we have once again provided for 25 000 to continue data collection work in connection with the dry bean acreage program that the agency is currently conducting in michigan it is anticipated that these funds should complete the project and are essential to be certain that the work is successfully completed i am pleased that we were able to provide a partial restoration for the agricultural cooperative service we did not restore all funds believing that each agency must share in the general budget reductions that are being imposed throughout this budget this egency is helping farmers start new cooperatives and expand existing ones through the cooperative effort farmers are able to get access to new markets and obtain better prices for their production farmers are likely to make greater use of acs to assist them in efforts to export more food products keeping in mind that agriculture already provides us with the largest positive item within our balance of trade within the funds available to the commodity credit corporation we once again make available not less than 500 000 000 to conduct export credit activities the only way that we can effectively sell our surplus crops is to increase our share of foreign markets but to the extent that access to such markets is dependent upon credit at rates competitive with those available from other countries that as a matter of public policy provide great subsidies to their agricultural exports this program will go a long way in making american products competitive title ii of this bill provides funds for the farmers home administration an agency that is of increasing importance to farmers in these difficult days farmers need access to credit at reasonable rates and they need some urderstanding when market conditions require them to alter their previoug credit arrangements this has historically been the case but as i have already pointed out the agency is not continuing to operate in this fashion efforts to get more farmers to surrender fmha loans for private loans at substantially higher interest rates or face foreclosure do not constitute a reasonable means of dealing with farmers who are facing the toughest times since the depression i have supported efforts to require fmha to act in a more reasonable fashion and i will continue to support such efforts the budget for fmha requested by the president reflects this destruction of the basic purpose of fmha to help farmers and rural communities while requested levels for ownership and operating loans are good the levels requested for housing assistance and rural development funds seem to point toward a lack of consideration for the quality of life in our nations rural areas for this reason the basic point of departure between our recommendations and the presidents budget can be found within these programs where we try to retain as many programs at fiscal 1982 levels as may be possible recognizing the budget lnittations under which we are operating we also in title ii continue our mandates on minimum loan levels for programs operated by the rural electrification administration in the absence of such minimums those who do not appreciate the importance of rea to rural electric and telephone service would continue their efforts to emasculate the program while claiming that private resources are enough to meet the need they fail to remember that if private resources had been enough we would not have had these programs in the first place until such time that credible information showing that these programs are not needed can be provided to our subcommittee we will continue to support funds for these rea programs such a demonstration has not yet been made title ii also contains funding for several conservation operations agriculture is nothing without the land and the land will not last unless we take careful steps to preserve it funds that we have provided for operations by the soil conservation service and the agricultural stabilization and conservation service help us to preserve our land or future needs while encouraging farmers to take the time and make the effort to protect their own land for their use and or the future as always we have found it necessary to restore asubstantial amount of funds for the agricultural conservation program somebody downtown thinks that we have done all that we need to do to preserve our land or they think that one way to hold down the appearance of a budget is to not request funds that they are sure the congress will restore we are willing to be honest with the american people acp is a vital program and its funding will continue at responsible levels so long as we have a real need for this program the chairman of our subcommittee mr w11rten is an eloquent defender of this program and all of my colleagues can learn from his experience the point is a simple one we grow our crops on land no landno crops no conservationno land no conservationno landno crops and our position as the worlds breakbasket will be lost for ever we have also restored funds for the forestry incentives program this program tries to preserve our forest lands for the future much in the same way that new efforts are being made under the renewable resources program operated by the extension service which is funded on the basis of carryover funds within this bill since no funds were effectively obligated until just very late this summer title iii provides funding for all of the feeding programs operated by the department of agriculture it is an expensive portion of our bill and one which attracts the greatest controversy it was made particularly difficult this year by the fact that the budget request was not based on current law but on an omb wish list of block grants and other legislative changes beyond the jurisdiction of the appropriations committee in many instances the legislative proposals necessary to achieve these modifications have not even been introduced for this r aon two items result the presidents budget understates the funding required to continue these programs at current services levels by 4 billion by usdas own admission and second we are constrained to fund programs based upon current law not the wish list submitted by omb as a consequence we fund programs under this title for different durations utilizing the dollars requested by the president for so long as they might be reasonably expected to last under current law should the president still obtain the legislative changes he might desire then in that case funds will be spent in accordance with the new law but until that time we are constrained to what existing law demands one major program which we fund until august 15 are the various child nutrition programs including school lunch school breakfast child care feeding and nutrition education training we spend at a level roughly equal to a certain annualized rate which more adequately reflects what is truly needed compared to the level requested in the presidents budget with respect to the school lunch p agram i would like to take this opportunity to remind the department that the recently enacted supplemental appropriations measure directs the department to treat bonus commodities within certain pilot school lunch projects in a manner different than they had hoped to treat them they can give bonus cash or bonus letters of credit for administrative ease but may not study such a modification because it goes beyond the scope of the authorized study and because bonus commodities are a separate program even though an important component of the school lunch program it is also important to note that there are a large number of commodities that are in surplus or priceweak conditions that the department could acquire for use in the school lunch program and the other feeding programs that utilize usdapurchased commodities i regret that the secretary has chosen to deny bonus commodity designation for wheat and i call upon him to reverse his decision in the best interest of both these commodity feeding programs and bur nations beleagured wheat producers i know that several other commodities will be seeking bonus designation or purchase assistance including navy beans if current market projections result in a pricedepressed market i hope that the secretary will be more responsive to those requests when they come forth we have fully restored funds for the special milk program 28 1 million we hope that this program will continue without interruption and expect that it will continue without any efforts to dissuade participation by those schools either currently in the program or who might be considering starting it we have provided funds for the women infants and children wic program until may 15 in order to continue to serve as many people as possible we expect that the department will continue to follow our intent on this matter and will not repeat last years fiasco in which 200 000 people were dropped from the program as a result of the budgetary gamesmanship employed by omb we have fully funded the commodity supplemental feeding program including an additional 900 000 for senior citizen pilot csf programs certain cities have had greater demand for this program and we expect that caseloads will be allocated so as to serve those areas with the greatest demand rather than lying idle among those operators who either do not have a demand which would fully utilize their caseload or who are not making efforts to utilize their caseloads according to usda they can currently support 146 000 people on this program but recent estimates show that they are only serving about 125 000 some of the csfp operators have waiting lists for many people and it is only proper that to the extent funds are available to serve the full caseload that the caseload be implemented rather than simply assigned i am very pleased that we were able to provide funding for certain senior pilot csfp programs we are adding new orleans within our bill so that it can be served as originally envisioned before the department followed the erroneous course of assigning projects in a manner which did not include new orleans as a designated site this means that three citiesincluding detroit and des moineswill operate this pilot program during fiscal 1983 and during fiscal 1984 since the legislation calling for these projects demands that they be operated for at least 2 years we will expect to see the department include an adequate budget request for these additional cities in its fiscal 1984 request in accordance with our report directive telling the department to develop its budget justifications based upon current law since the department already has the new orleans technical proposal in hand and since the senate has also included new orleans within its fiscal 1983 bill we will expect the depart ment to implement the project as soon as possible upon enactment of either the regular fiscal 1983 appropriation or the continuing resolution for fiscal 1983 which includes this project the department also should keep in mind that officials of the department have already indicated that those funds that had been appropriated for the senior pilot csfp projects in fiscal 1982 but have not yet been expended will remain available for the senior projects in fiscal 1983 this means that the 900 000 we provide is in addition to whatever unexpended funds remain available at the end of fiscal 1982 including any funds that are unexpended and unobligated to use any of these funds for a purpose other than the senior pilot projects is contrary to congressional intent there is growing concern that the administrative funds provided for csfp operators do not sufficiently reflect what is really happening in the program particularly because of the fact that more surplus commodities are being given as bonus items in this program the formula for the distribution of administrative funds to local agencies should reflect actual participation and the level of assistance provided by each agency to the projects clients simply those programs that do more should get more administrative money whether because of serving a larger caseload or because of distributing more items within the food package since under food program administration we direct the department to provide reimbursement for local distribution of surplus commodities we can expect the department to also use these funds in order to provide additional administrative assistance associated with the higher costs of distributing bonus commodities that are not included in the csfp package and also those items which even though bonus are regularly includable in the csfp package and are not considered within the provision of administrative funds because funds were not specifically appropriated for their purchase for inclusion in csfp but if the department is providing the same food package as it has previousif it should provide the same level of administrative funds as it did previously i will expect the department to make all appropriate regulatory changes and to advise me of any statutory changes that might be necessary in order to accomplish such a result and i expect to raise this matter with the department at next years hearings we have provided funds for the food stamp program through july 15 once again the president did not request sufficient funds to continue the program through the full fiscal year as reii17326 quired by the authorizing legislation i understand that the senate has provided full years funding with the endorsement of the administration and i am hoping that we can resolve this matter in conference one out of every nine people in the state of michigan is receiving food stamps recently more than 1 million people in michigan were receiving stamps emphasizing the terrible problems facing our depressed economy people need help and i want to see them continue to get the help they need in order to live with dignity we provide for two very important items under the food program administration section of the report the first of these items directs the department to reestablish the administrative procedures necessary for the domestic distribution of surplus food products held in ccc inventory to help hungry americans commodities provide an additional source of assistance and should be used to the extent practicable such distribution is not intended to replace any existing food program and should not be treated as such rather we are searching for an additional method of providing assistance to hungry americans using a resource that we have in plentiful supplyfood this is one project i intend to follow with great interest our report also directs support for another major activitythe existing donation of surplus foods on a local basis there is no question that the legal authority exists for usda to give local charitable groups church groups or public service organizations the type of assistance that will enable them to continue to conduct the current surplus donation of dairy items which could be expanded to include other food items in the future we want the department to provide reimbursement for the reasonable costs associated with local distribution including but not limited to storage transportation reporting requirements personnel facilities processing and other similar items many communities are now saying that they cannot continue to operate this community food donation system in the absence of financial support for distribution costs volunteer efforts have been exhausted or are insufficient to meet the task failure to provide such assistance will mean that many localities will discontinue the program and literally thousands of otherwise eligible people will be deprived of the opportunity to obtain these wholesome food items title iv provides funding for our international agricultural programs most importantly the foreign agricultural service and public law 480 we depend upon export markets for a major portion of farm income it is for this reason that we need to do all that we can to continue to cultivate our existing and potential markets overseas if we are the worlds food producer then we can and should be the worlds provider it is only through strong international efforts that we will increase our market share and responsible furiding will help fas to find these new markets for our producers but it is trite that there are hungry people throughout the world our public law 480 program attempts to reach these people through their governments by providing commodities at competitive prices with attractive credit rates some of our public law 480 customers have become our better export customers when their economies have improved sufficiently to place them in a stronger trading position avoiding the need for the special assistance that public law 480 provides each year there are several proposals to increase our nations food aid programs i have supported these efforts and will continue to support responsibile efforts in this regard but no advocate of solving world hunger should lose sight of the fact that public law 480 is a great device for providing food assistance to needy nations around the world we cannot ignore the tools we have while trying to design new ones our report specially emphasizes using title i in order to open up new commercial markets i hope that the department will be successful in meeting this directive it can mean a great deal to our balance of trade this is an exhaustive bill it serves the farmer and the consumer it recognizes the tremendous interrelationship between the two and the farmer as a consumer particularly with farm credit programs the bill appreciates the needs of all americans including the poor who need food stamps the elderly who use the senior meals programs and the young who use the child nutrition programs it covers domestic and international trade most importantly this bill adheres to its budget limitations we cannot do all that each of us might like we probably are doing some things within this bill now with which other members might disagree but as our chairman has said so clearly this bill reflects the diverse needs of our nation and tries to treat all of them fairly i urge my colleagues to support this bill it is within budget limitations and it will do what is in the best interest of our nation"], [0.49396854639053345, 0.5060314536094666, 1, "i would like to focus the debate on the issues before us the distinguish~ed gentleman from illinois mr pjinup m crane has brought before this body house resolution 208 a resolution to disapprove a specific action of the council of the district of columbia the district of columbia sexual assault act of 1981 district of columbia act 469 the question before us at this point is how do we now proceed in our consideration of this resolution my colleague the gentleman from illinois argues that the constitution gives us the responsibility to review any act passed by the council of the district of columbia to which we take objection that is embodied in the home rule act of 1973 we have the specific right to reserve unto ourselves the review of all laws enacted by the district of columbia government and under certain provisions our colleagues can bring a resolution of disapproval have it referred to the district of columbia committee and then based upon the committees action have it come before the full body of the house of representatives now the question is how do we as a body proceed it seems to me there are two directions in which we can go direction no 1 is to repeat the process by which the city council arrived at its action in 1974 the unitedstates congress brought to reality the law revision commission in 1977 the law revision commission made recommendations to the city council with respect to modernizing and reforminfg the criminal code in 1980 and 1981 the city council of the district of columbia held extensive hearings those hearings were the basis upon which the city council acted now i have here the list of the witnesses that were brought before the city council in hearings over a 2 year period in this first page without reading the names there are 15 witnesses listed on the secondpage 6 witnesses on the third page 12 witnessos on the fourth page 11 witnesses on the fifth page 14 witnesses on the final page 12 witnesses now if we are going to proceed with the first potential alternative and that is to repeat the action of the city council we would indeed in all good faith have to hold a series of hearings throughout this entire city in every neighborhoodl area and come up with a list of 50 or 60plus people who would have the opportunity to testify we could go through the act word by word line by line sentence by sentence and evaluate the law enacted by the city council but i would suggest that we are not a court of competent jurisdiction unless we are prepared to at least replicate and or go beyond what the city council did in arriving at its decision to enact district of columbia public i w 469 a bill to reform the crtmin~i code in the specific area of sexual assault but wve as a body chose in 1973 to not replicate the city counill we in our wisdom decided that there were too often competing interests in the district of columbia the federal interest and that is all of amfericas interest in the capital of the united states and the local interest the 600 000 or 700 000 human beings who live in washington d c who have the right to the franchise as any other citizen in the united states we in our wisdom decided that we did not want the district of columbia to be a colony of the united states in fact there are many organizations that perceive the district of columbia as the last colony of the united states and my colleagues in their collective wisdom suggested that we must do awvay with that give the district of columbia the franchise and we did and so it would seem to me that to attempt to replicate the business of the city council is an absurdity eight years ago we decided that we had more important things to do than to act as the city council of the district of columbia we had foreign policy calculations to absorb and consider we had defense policy calculations to absorb and consider we had enormous domestic issues affecting over 200 million americans that we should be engaging in and placing our intellectual spiritual moral and political energies into that business and we said let us free ourselves of the business of being the city council and we enacted in 1973 the home rule act thvg residents of the district of columbia duly elected a mayor and city council to do the business to express the will of the people in this district so they engaged in this process and as a result unanimously not majority unanimously enacted this law 13 to 0 so if we decide or if we are consistent with our efforts in home rule we must now strike this first proceeding and that is to replicate repeat engage in redundant activities with respect to what the district of columbia did in arriving at the enactment of this law what is the second mechanism the second mechanism is to think through what was the spirit and the intent of congress when it enacted the law in 1973 we said we chose not to be the city council we stepped back from that but my colleagues on this side of the aisle who support this resolution are correct my colleagues did write into the law an opportunity to review that is not the question here the question is what criteria shall wve use in the process of review that is consistent with the home rule act and is consistent with our desire for justice and our desire to embrace high ideals of democracy democratic principles and democratic procedures that then leads us to how the district of columbia committee arrived at the criteria it established in trying to determine whether we shall or shall not vote on a resolution of disapproval we decided that it was not within our jurisdiction in terms of the spirit of the home rule act or our competency to look at the specific legislation we came up with different criteria we said no 1 does the act of the city council violate the home rule act that seems to me quite reasonable and quite intelligent and one can arrive at an objective assessment of that question irrespective of political views ideological perspective or value orientation the question is did they violate the home rule act a reasonably intelligent human being can take the home rule act in one hand and the act or law of the city council in the other and arrive at some conclusion with respect to that no one here argues that they have exceeded their authority or indeed violated any section any line any sentence of the home rule act our second criteria was have the council violated the constitution of the united states no one here is competently asserting with a straight face that this act in any way challenges constitutional prerogatives or constitutional rights of any american citizen the third criteria does the act of the council in any way raise a federal issue or obstruct the federal interest and what is the federal interest does it obstruct the capacity of the unitedstates congress to represent 200plus million americans as it carries out its responsibility fhas the city council engaged in an act that thwarts our capacity to do this the answer to that is no so i am suggesting and members of this body it is a serious matter before us it is not frivolous i feel quite pained that we are here in a limited debate on a matter that strikes at the very fundamental processes of our way of life this is not a frivolous matter a few of my colleagues came in on this last rolleall angry because someone called a quorum call that would ask them to come down from the house dining room to this body and at least participate in the debate to disenfranchise 600 000 human beings and the response was what are you people doing you are making us angry we are going to vote against everything anid the point is we are prepared to harmn people but we do not want to do the work and be participants in the lynching if we are going to harm people at least integrity ought to dictate that we come here and do it in the full light of day and stop posturing politically for other purposes this is a serious matter here and i would suggest that we are not competent to repeat the business of the city council this is not an appropriate vehicle i chose not to engage in a dialog on the specific legislation because i think it is inappropriately before us however i do think given the law that we have a responsibility to review it in our wisdom as members of the district of columbia committee and as members of the house many of us have come to the conclusion that we have to have objective criteria to be used in our review that falls within the framework the spirit and intent if the home rule act now some of my colleagues are isaying this matter has achieved a level of significant controversy the moral majority is interested in this issue the reverend falwell is interested in this issue bishops aire interested in this issue but somewhere in the third or fourth grade i learned there is a separation of church and state here that is some way we ought to be engaging in dealing with matters that are our responsibility within the frame~~ork of democratic processes and irrespective of this controversy we ought to have the integrity to stay within the guidelines of procedures that can move us through this morass without imposing our personal religious views and without challenging a body and destroying the process simply because we disagree there are a number of the members on this side of the aisle with whom i have nothing in coimmon politically but i would stand with them and fight violently against any effort that would deny us the right to at least express our will everyone of these members has a city council that could enact this very same law but those same members cannot apply that to the government in washington d c their response is but this is the capitol and my response is in 1973 the congress understood and identified the duality of interests here and we attempted in our wisdom with an extra amount of compromises to make this dichotomy as clear as we could within that really conservative atmosphere that we enacted the home rule act in so this is an inappropriate matter to bring before the congress of the united states unless we are dealing with this within the spirit of the home rule act but many of our colleagues are saying but ron i just do not buy the specific provisions my progressive political posture would have dictated that i vote against the gambling ordinance in the district of columbia as i said earlier in the debate but i did not impose my personal will because i am more concerned about giving life to the democratic process that is all we have without that we are cannibals without a civilized set of processes we will cannibalize each other we are just an unruly mob of people who can willynilly move on anyone irrespective of their ideas and i am not sure that is what we are about here i would say to the maker of this motion if the gentlerran is serious then why does he not offer a sexual reform act for the entire nation and then let us engage in debate on that question that would at least be more honest than saying we can have home rule part of the time but when i do not agree with it or it is inconvenient we cannot have home rule people cannot live between freedom and servitude freedom is an absolute principle it seems to me that in this country where we are now saying this is the great bastion of democracy how can we in the capitol of the united states thwart peoliles rights because we are prepared to dance on the whims of political expediency and we all know there is enormous pressure a number of my colleagues do not even know what the issue is here but some kind of way they say rights are involved the moral majority is involved maybe i had better dance but my colleagues we are dancing on our own freedoms because maybe tomorrow the challenge will be to our rights and who will stand for us i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.494109570980072,

200th birthday it was 200 years ago on september 4 1781 that el pueblo de ha reina de los angeles sobre el rio de ha porcuincula was founded as the first spanish civilian settlement in southern california today the towers of the new downtown los angeles skyline cllong shadows across a bustling plain where an indian village a spanish colonial settlement a mexican provincial capitol and a yankee boomtown lie buried beneath the bicentennial celebration just concluded helped make angelenos aware of the richness of their history which i now commend to the attention of my colleagues the initial settlers of los angeles consisted of 11 families 22 adults and 22 children who were recruited from the provinces of sinaloa and sonora in new spain now called mexico by capt fernando de rivera y moncuda emissary of the governor of california felipe de neve they included farmers artisans and stockraisers necessary for the survival of the settlement escorted by spanish soldiers they departed from los mlamas sonora on february 2 1781 and arrived in the summer of that year their goal was to establish an agricultural pu nli to provide rood for soldiers at the presidios at san diego and santa barbara ranging in age from 1 to 67 the pobladores reflected the cultural henltage and racial diversity that link thle citys past to it present almost all of the settlers from the surrounding province of sonora were of mixed blood three ethnic groups were represented among the earlier settlers spanish indian and black twentysix of the pobladores were of african ancestry since spanish law had always made it easy for black bondsmen to buy their freedom in new spain and custom had raised no barriers to intermarriage the three reasons for the choice of the site were the obvious fertility of the land the availability of water and the nearby location of an indian village called yang na thus the settlers would enjoy the prospect of agricultural productivity water and a source of labor no eyewitness account of the pueblos founding has ever turned up since none of the founding fathers could read or write however mythmakers have cloaked the days events in suitable splendor depicting governor de neve on horseback at the head of a procession of priests soldiers settlers and converted indians by the start of the 20th century the ceremony was thought to be the most extensive and most impressive ever held over the founding of an american city in the spring of 1822 word reached el pueblo that mexico had won its independence from spain california was now mexican territory angelenos of the day dutifully changed the flag flying about the plaza replacing the spanish lion with the mexican serpent the transformation for los angeles came with the acquistion of california by the united states at the end of the mexican war gradually the little mexican settlement was transformed into a yankee town the key being the increased american population the first notable anglo to reach los angeles was abel stearns in 1832 stearns was born in massachusetts but lived and had become a spanish citizen in south america as the town grew so did its needs the first railroad south of the tehachapis formally opened and the first train left the new los angeles depot on the morning of october 26 1869 with the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1872 many chinese came to los angeles some in the search for gold others just seeking a new way of life like their black and brown brothers before them they found discrimination but remained and persevered by the turn of the century los angeles was already experiencing the escalation in property values and shortage of downtown parking space which continue to this day indeed los angeles in the early 1900s was overwhelmed with growth due in large part to the infant oil drilling and movie industries the events of the 20th century have left their mark on the tiny pueblo which has seen its population soar fromn 102 000 in 1900 to nearly 3 million today world war ii of course had a special significance for the citys 40 000 residents of japanese descent and the citys postwar boom fueled in large part by the growth of the areas aerospace industry has exascerbated the problems of transportation and air quality which confront the presentday mayor city council as well as its legislative delegations today 200 years later los angeles finds itself as the third largest city in this the greatest nation in the world nearly 3 million persons call it home and many more come to visit like any of the worlds great cities los angeles has come to mean many things to many people aesthetically los angeles today is a vast and beautiful metropolis one in which highrises and stucco homes beaches and mountains lush vegetation and desert lands exist sideby side at 463 square miles its land area is larger than any major city in the world in addition to its fabulous beaches that area boasts the only major mountain range to be found in any american city the santa monicas and at the eastern tip of those mountains lies griffith park the largest municipallyowed park in the country culturally los angeles retains all the glitter and glamour of early hollywood and then some the vitality and enthusiasm of the nations entertainment pervades the city and the creative energies of thousands of men and womenfrom d w griffith to francis ford coppolahave

crowd beautiful dodger stadium the crown jewel of major league baseball across town the memory of 10 ncaa basketball championships continue to make westwood and ucla the mecca of college basketball and while los angeles waits patiently for the return of professional football its two collegiate powerhouses usc and ucla consistently bring top 10 rankings back to their mutual home the los angeles coliseum it is athletics which has brought los angeles perhaps its proudest modern distinction as the only city in the world to host the summer olympics on two separate occasions less than 3 years hence the world comes to the united statesto los angelesfor the games of the xxiii olympiad the 1984 games promise to surpass their predecessors not only in pageantry and athletic excellence but also in the prudence perspective and commonsense in which they are being conducted as i inentioned each person who comes to los angeles carries away his or her own special memory or impression of its attributes to me the one thing which has made los angeles the modernday success story that it is has been the will of its people all kinds of people to work together in a spirit of unity and community again perhaps no city in the country can match los angeles ethnic diversity and cosmopolitan character los angeles has the secondlargest spanishspeaking population of any city in the world trailing only mexico city it trails only new york among followers of the jewish faith and it remains the largest city in unitedstates history to elect a black mayor which it has now done three times each group

maryland for his comments and i agree with every point he made a great many of our colleagues have asked that statements with respect to gladys be placed in the record and i will see to it that those are placed in the record i also want to bring to the attention of the house a statement in tribute to gladys by one of her closest friends who left the house in january former congressman joseph l fisher from virginia joe has given me a brief statement which i want to read so all the members of the house will be aware of it joe writes as follows we are all saddened that gladys spellman has to give up her seat in the house her contributions to policy and legislation on behalf of her maryland constituents and the nation have been important no member has been more finely attuned to the needs problems and aspirations of government employeescivil postal militarythan congresswoman spellman or congressperson spellperson as she would say tongue in cheek i shall always treasure my own friendship with gladys which began long before our period together in congress when we fought the battles for better government in the national capital region in the council of governments metro and other arenas gladys has left her own distinctive mark on all public issues and institutions with which she has been associated things are better becaume of what she has done we long for her recovery and her return to public life we need her mature judgment her political savvy her charm her devotion to the general welfare thank you gladys for all you have done god bless you that is the statement of one whom we all know one of gladys closest friends joe fisher i want to comment about some of the issues this could take all afternoon i do not have all afternoon but i want to comment about some of the issues gladys put her heart and soul into here in the house one of which was the construction of a beautiful and really firstclass public transportation system for the nations capital while many local officials have made important contributions to the construction of the washington area subway system i think it is fair to say that gladys spellmans contribution in this respect has been simply remarkable her efforts in the early years as a county commissioner were critical in laying the groundwork for what was to become the system 19e are building and using today she not only had the foresight to see what was possible many years ago but in her subsequent roles as chairperson of the washington suburban transit commission as vice president of the local council of governments as a council member in prince georges county and finally as the fifth districts congressional representative gladys worked diligently to translate her ideas into reality there were many who observing the often fractious nature of interjurisdictional relations in this area said that producing a firstrate subway system in the nations capital just couldnt be done gladys is one of the reasons why in fact it has been done most recently gladys worked in a collective effort with the other metro supporters in the congress for passage of the starkharris bill in the 96th congress providing for completion of the 101mile system now in existence today another issue is the baltimorewashington parkway one of the reasons gladys is appreciated really on a daily basis by her constituents and by all of us in maryland was her work to overcome delays in government and other obstacles which had been putting off resurfacing and upgrading of the baltimorewashington parkway when it became apparent that longstanding disagreements between federal and state transportation agencies were precluding needed repairs from being performed on this highway gladys went to work as only gladys can she used her considerabb influence here in the congress to win a federal appropriation for the work because the highway is maintained by the park service she then worked closely with high way officials to make certain that the work was done quickly and done with a minimum of disruption to the commuters on the highway if this does not strike some as a major accomplishment just ask any of the thousands of hapless commuters who endured the potholes and other dangerous conditions on that highway while the various governmental agencies could not agree on how to go forward on the repairs this is a good illustration i thinkand that is all it is an illustrationof how gladys could tackle a problem and work with all the affected parties and come up with a solution that solves that problem on other local issues she simply worked tirelessly to preserve the impact aid funds for her district to compensate the fifth district for tax revenues lost due to the presence of federally owned land these funds were used to provide a quality education to the children of her district and to prevent placing an unfair tax burden on her local taxpayers she successfully kept intact the beltsville agricultural research center an extremely important part of her community gladys led the fight to keep a toxic waste dump from being located in her congressional district she played an instrumental role in bringing in federal dollars for a very much needed urban renewal project in college park the seat of our great state university and she worked tirelessly with our metro caucus in the house on regional issues in addition to the metro system in an effort to curb aircraft noise to resolve environmental problems facing the washington area and generally to promote cooperation among the governments and people of the washington area i think those of us who came to know and love gladys in the past years will obviously think of her accomplishments on local issues but i suspect we will remember her most as a master politician one with just extraordinary savvy who understood the political process as few i have ever known and one who could make it work for the people she represented she was the chief advocate in this institution and the chief spokesman for the cause and the interest of federal workers and i can tell you as one who also represents a lot of federal employees that gladys presence in this institution is missed by all of them and by all of us who seek to serve them she was probably the major proponent and executor of better intergovernmental relations in the house she had been president as i mentioned earlier of the national association of countries and nobody in this institution better understood the relationships between the federal state and local governments than gladys and how to fit them together and how to make them work i would like to speak for a moment about what i came to know as i sat here on the floor with gladys hour after hour during debate about the priorities in her life because they transcended the kinds of issues and the politics that i have been discussing foremost in those priorities i think would have to be what the distinguished gentlewoman from louisiana was talking about earlierher love and her loyalty to her family to her friends and to the staff who worked with her so brilliantly her children and her grandchildren were i can attest the most important things in her life i do not know how many times we were on the floor and stood in the back of the chamber when gladys comments turned to something that happened with her children or with her grandchildren she never lost sight of the members of her family despite the tremendous demands of being an active politician in this day and age and we all know she was an indefatigable politician another priority for gladys was her sensitivity to those individuals in our society who have afflictions maybe not many members here knew it but gladys was once blind fortunately she was able to overcome that handicap she understood perhaps because of that better than most the special problems of the handicapped assisting the handicapped and the downtrodden were in many respects chief priorities for gladys spellman as an elected official i could not talk about the priorities that gladys spellman has had without talking about her integrity and her absolute total honesty i gather that she learned from her father henry noonhe was a former head of the d g s stores here in the district of columbia he was known for conducting his business with the highest of ethics and integrity gladys was always guided in her ethics by her father gladys career as a public official was exemplary in that respect as in every other something that has been mentioned by others but i want to underscore was gladys spellmans belief in constituent service the distinguished gentlewoman from new jersey referred to it very eloquently gladys spellman established i am convinced one of the finest constituent services that the united states has ever seen she was always accessible to the people of prince georges county her chief duty as a member of congress she believed was to solve her constituents problems she never deviated from that commitment to her constituents and her everincreasing margins of victory i think were strong testimony to that fact let me say something about another quality of gladys which sometimes is not talked about with politicians but it is so true with her and that is her gutsthe gutsiness of this woman if ever there was a person who knew how to use a velvet glove with the impact of an iron fist it is gladys spellman she is a very gutsy womanon civil rights on issues of concern to women to federal employees to the people of her districtbut she also knew how to get things done in this institution and she accomplished a tremendous amount during her term in the house i want to piuse now to yield to another friend of gladys spellman"], [0.49426376819610596, 0.505736231803894, 1, "irs july 1979 the select committee on assassinations which i was privileged to chair filed its final report on the deaths of president john f kennedy and dr martin luther king jr at the time most peoples attention was focused on our conclusions that these two men most likely died as a result of conspiracies in fact our work went well beyond the conspiracy question and we made a series of important legislative and administrative recommendations it is in light of those recommendations that i now rise to introduce along with my colleagues mr edgar mr ford of tennessee mr fithian mr mokinney and mr fatyntroy the violence control act of i know that you do not need to be reminded that this sunday will mar the 18th anniversary of president kennedys assassination sorely a pivotal event in american history more than any single murder since that event changed our world and our perception of it though others were victims of brutal homicides in the following years that murder uniquely made america seem less green less full of promise less full of hope for it seemed as if amer ica lost its youth when the young president died it is ironic too that a child born on that tragic day in dallas would be 18 years old this sundayan adult in americas eyesold enough to vote and participate in a responsible way in the public aspects of our life in common in what sort of world has that child become an adult sadly it is increasingly a world more violent than the day on which he was born in 1960 thrs nation suffered 9 000 murders by 1980 that figure had risen to 23 000an increase of inore than 156 percent though our general population had grown but 22 percent while it is of course true that the violence prone age bracket15 to 24increased faster than the general population oier those years the increase was only 72 percent the increase in violence that our society has experienced over the past 20 years is not some statistical mirage as some editorial writers or academicians would have us believe it is all to real for all too many people in fact the data showing an increaseobtained independently from police and coroner recordsunderstate the true extent of violence for a remarkable improvement has taken place over these years in the quality of emergency medical treatm~ent and facilities particularly in urban areas many attacks that would have been murders yesterday go down as aggravated assaults today witness only one recent examplethe shooting of presidential press secretary james brady twenty years ago it is unlikely that he would have survived these homicide statistics therefore document only part of the tragedy of violence in our society today in 1960 this nation saw 150 000 aggravated assaults by 1980 the figure has risen to 650 000an increase of more than 330 percent the impact of this rise in personnel violence has been repeatedly documented a recent national survey found that 4 out of 10 americans were highly fearful and felt unsafe in their own homes at about the time of the assassination attempt on president reagans life a harris survey showcd a dramatic rise in the number of americans who felt that the crime rate in their area was increasing with 68 percent saying that crime was on the upswing compared to only 46 percent saying so in 1978 additionally 48 percent of the adult population reported that they personally feel uneasy not only in their hones but on the public streets up from 40 percent who felt that way in 1978 the american people too express a sense of futility with law enforcement they feel according to the harris survey a growing sense that the present system of law enforcement does not discourage criminal activity a viewv now held by a shocking 79 percent of adults nationwide and the peoples perception is not wholly wrong the statistics show a steady decline in the percentage of all offenses that the police feel they solve through arrest that parallels the increase in the volume of offenses murder clearance rates for example have dropped from 92 percent in 1960 to 73 percent in 1973 aggravated assault rates from 76 to 59 percent the police are in short being overwhelmed by volume and the people are being left helpless and frustrated there are other more personal ways of stating the stark facts an american male born today is more likely to die by murder than an american soldier in world war 11 was to die in combat in fact 1 out of 186 live born white males are expected to be murder victims in their lifetime murder is the leading cause of death for black males age 15 to 24 in fact 1 out of 29 live born nonwhite males will be murdered in their lifetime a particularly disturbing aspect of the violence that has characterized our society in recent years is assassinations not only of political leaders but also of public figures in the 150 years since 1835 when richard lawrences pistol misfired as he shot at president andrew jackson there were 12 attacks on presidents or presidential candidates four presidents were killedlincoln garfield mckinley and kennedyi out of every 10 men to have held that high office in the first 100 years there were 15 attacks in the past 50 years there were 7 attacks since 1963 there were six attacks indeed three o ut of the last six presidents have been the targets of assassins and onepresident fordwas attacked twice it we look beyond the office of the presidency and include attacks on public figuresmen such as dr martin luther king jr malcolm x john lennon and most recently vernon jordan jr it appears that we are running an assassination attempt rate of at least one per year how long our social fabric can withstand the pressures that these attacks create only history will tell what i do know is that assassination is more than a deadly assault on another human being as our final report observed of an assassination it is an attack on the foundations of democracymajority rule due process of law consensual decisionmaking individual rights and liberties it undermines the political system by deterring qualified people from seeking public office or exercising leadership it produces fear among the citizenry a seige mentality and often leads to the creation of vigilante groups civil disorder and other counterterrorist activities i we must be frank with one another and with our constituents there is not a great deal that law enforcement can do directly to control personal violence murder and aggravated assault are largely societal problems beyond the direct control of governments fiftytwo percent of the victims of murder in 1979 were acquainted with their assailants and 1 out of 5 were related by blood or marriage to the offender fortytwo percent of the murders grew out of arguments over romantic triangles alcohol or drug property or money or similar issues only 22 2 percent of the murders were in fact felony homicides that is murders committed usually between strangers during the course of other crimes such as robbery narcotic dealings or sex offenses no system of law enforcement can protect individuals from their family and friends we know too that highmurder rates are significantly correlated with the presence of illiteracy young males without education broken homes with female heads of households and poverty increased education more stable family life and increased and more meaningful jobs will in short do more to lower the murder rate than criminal legislation of any kind that too is a fact we must be frank on another score the federal government does not and cannot be expected to play a large role in controlling that part of violence on which law enforcement can have a direct impact historically the federal government has not had jurisdiction over commonlaw type offensesmurder aggravated assault rape robbery and the like and the federal government does not have the personnel to do much more than it is doing now currently it employs 75 000 persons and spends 1 9 billion in the law enforcement prosecution courts and correction areas yet state and local governments employ more than 620 000 persons and spend more than 11 1 billion in similar efforts were all of the federal effort in short focused in this area and none of its uniquely federal responsibilities were met it is doubtful therefore that its impact would significantly increase the level of public safety iv recognizing our limits and the limits of law itself is not to counsel despair or inaction we must do what we can dean roscoe pound of the harvard law school identified the four chief factors influencing the quality of american justice as personnel administration procedure and the substantive law it is evident too as pound conlcuded that these factors must be ranked in that same oider of relative importance personnel and administration have been left to others our job therefore must be to guarantee that procedural and substantive law are the best that can be fashioned by the minds and hands of creative men and women it is in that spirit that my colleagues and i are introducing today the violence control act of my colleagues and i are introducing this legislation as a study bill none of us are necessarily committed to any provision of the bill as presently drafted it is introduced to serve as a vehicle on which to hold hearings i am hopeful however that when hearings are held that a consensus will emerge on the issues raised by the bill and that legislation will quickly reach president reagans desk for his signature following the recommendations of the select committee title i of the proposed legislation codifies and reforms the law of federally cognizable personal violence title i draws on the work of a number of distinguished groups including the american law institute and the national commission on the reform of federal criminal law in addition it draws on the able work already done in the house and senate in the past 10 years or more to codify revise and reform the federal criminal law it has long been suggested that the federal criminal law is in need of a thorough reorganization unfortunately our criminal statutes are currently spread in haphazard fashion through most of the 50 titles of the united states code and in many cases they are conflicting contradictory and imprecise the result is that there is not only confusion but there are illogical and often unfair discrepancies present in the application of the law over 10 years ago congress called for a complete reexamination of the federal criminal justice system and after years of hearings studies and successive bills this congress is again working on revising the criminal code with s 1630 which has the administrations support h r 4711 introduced by congressman conyers and h r 1847 1 am hopeful that the legislation i introduce today with my colleagues can be considered along with or in addition to the major codification efforts for if the general codification effort again becomes mired in controversy i would hope this much needed legislation can be processed separately title i of the proposed act also faces the delicate issue of capital punishment and resolves it not by increasing the level of violence in our society by state sanctioned deaths but by authorizing a new concept of imprisonment in federal law life without release only the presidents constitutional power to pardon could serve as an avenue of release for a person convicted of murder title ii draws on other recommendations of the select committee some of its more important provisions wouldmandate contingency planning by the department of justic6 to deal with assassinations authorize federal autopsies and create trusts for victims of federally cognizable violence this last provision requires particularly close study testimony before the select committee indicated that efforts were made to insulate the widow of dr martin luther king jr from the funds james earl ray hoped to realize from the sale of media rights to the facts around the assassination to deal with just that sort of reprehensible conduct a number of states12 at last counthave moved in the last 4 years or so to discourage profiteering by criminals through the sale of their life stories they have taken as their lead the principle followed in riggs against palmer an 1889 new york decision in which the court ob~served no one should be permitted to profit by his own fraud or to take advantage of his own wrong 0 or to acquire property by his own crime these maxims are dictated by ruablic policy and have their foundation in universal law administered by all civilized countries i recognize of course that criticisms have been leveled at these laws on the first amendment grounds that they are an impermissible burden on the free speech rights of criminals nevertheless i am hopeful that the hearing process will be able to develop some workable compromise in this area between the rights of the wrongdoer and his victims title iii of the proposed legislation goes beyond the recommendations of the select committee the need for it however is dramatically illustrated by the attack on president reagan on march 30 here in washington john hinckley jr shot at the president gravely wounding the presidents press secretary and seriously wounding mr reagan and others as i previously noted it was only good luck and a fine hospital facility so close at hand that prevented the nation from losing another president to the bullets of an assassin john hinckley is of course now standing trial in the district of columbia and his attorneys have been seeking to have him found not guilty by reason of insanity nothing that i say here today should be construed as an effort to affect those proceedings but should hinckley go free i note that he will still have to receive under federal law applicable to the district of columbia medical treatment in the form of therapy butand this is my pointhad hinckley shot at president reagan in alexandria va and been found not guilty by reason of insanity in a federal trial for the attack he could have just walked out of the door of the courtroom and never have to receive therapy as hard as it might seem to believe there is in fact no general provision of federal law applicable outside of the district of columbia requiring that those found not guilty by reason of insanity in federal courts undergo medical treatment richard lawrence as i noted earlier fired at andrew jackson in 1835 and was committed to a hospital where he remained until his death in 1881 john schrank a saloon keeper shot theodore roosevelt during a campaign visit to milwaukee in 1912 and was committed to a hospital where he remained until his death in 1943 nevertheless congress had never moved to guarantee that this procedure must be followed in all cases i believe we have waited too long to remedy this defect title iv of the proposed legislation also goes beyond the recommendations of the select committee i expect too that it will be controversial for it makes provisions for the registration and licensing of handguns while this provisionmodeled after legislation supported in the senate by senator ted kennedywas not considered by the select committee it mayr well be the most significant part of the proposerl legislation i over the past two decades firearms have consistently been the weapon of choice in more than 60 percent of the homicides handguns have been the weapon of choice in more than 50 percent of the killings presidential or other federal groups or commissionsat least seven in numberhave repeatedly called for strict handgun controlthe national commission for criminal justice standards and goals the commission on crime in the district of columbia the commission on law enforcement and administration of justice the commission on cause and prevention of violence the national advisory commission on civil disorders the national commission on the reform of federal criminal law and most recently the attorney generals task force on violent crime those who oppose meaningful restraints on the use of handguns rely on six tired arguments that are almost as old as the republic first opponents of handgun control insist their right to bear arms is rooted in the constitution the argument is then extended to claim that gun control deprives them of their right to pursue happiness with guns free of government limits but in fact the courts have said that the constitution does not interfere with the power of the government to regulate deadly weapons since we mean to enact legislation that will halt the abuse of the handguns of those who find happiness in such weapons they will just have to subordinate that pleasure to the right of all americans to live free from the death and violence that the american gun mania has brought us second many people make the argument that because lawless citizens will feel no obligation to be bound by gun laws gun controls will simply disarm those who abide by the law i am convinced however that strict enforcement of licensing and registration laws will serve to isolate precisely those individuals who flaunt the law and subject them to prosecution for gun violations before they commit other crimes with their guns third critics of gun control insist that laws cannot control access to guns yet the records show that even the limited provisions of the 1968 gun control act have severely altered the flow of one kind of weaponthe imported handgun in addition the national firearms act of 1934 essentially eliminated civilian access to machineguns sawed off rifles and shotguns mufflers and silencers gun control in short is in fact possible fourth a common refrain against handgun control is that guns dont kill people do but a careful examination of the statistics tells us that it is when guns are in hand that twothirds of the people who attack each other act in a deadly fashion for rarely does an attacker make a deliberate c4 oice of a gun over a knife because the fatality rate of knife wounds is about onefifth that of gun wounds using a knife instead of a gun might well cause 80 percent fewer deaths attacks may not decline but deadly attacks surely will fifth modern critics of gun control express outrage at the vaulting gun crime rate insisting that we do not need more gun laws instead they say we should enact longterm mandatory penalties for crimes committed with guns even if our penal system were not already overcrowded this proposal could be counted upon to produce undesirable results penalties do not deter an angry person from reaching for a gun and if penalties were in fact made much stronger the extra punishment might well encourage the armed robber to leave no witnesses thus it is likely that high mandatory penalties would in fact cause more gun deaths than they would prevent sixth the greatest number of those who protect gun control legislation apparently believe that the administrative requirements for registration would be too cumbersome and inconvenient such requirements are thought to be unfair and punitive in that the persons really affected so adversely are law abiding citizens who pursue shooting as a hobby or as a form of recreation to these people i can only say how thoughtless you are when you value your own inconvenience over the lives of others this recitation of the arguments on handgun control includes the core of the objections vehemently raised and expertly used by the national rifle association and other gun advocates to force the justice department and the department of the treasury to turn the current administrations attention away from serious efforts to do something about violence but i say that if there is any issue that congress understands it is the matter of strong handgun laws each member of the house is awareor ought to be awarethat seven commissions or national study groups have recommended stronger gun laws to reduce gun killing in 1966 the commission on civil disorders recommended that all state and local governments should enact gun control legislation the final report asserted thatwe believe that federal legislation is essential in order to make state and local laws fully effective and to regulate areas beyond the reach of state government in february 1967 the commission on law enforcement and administration of justice reported that strict controls by state or city are nullified when a potential criminal can secure a firearm merely by going into a neighboring jurisdiction with few controls or none at all in 1968 the commission on the causes and prevention of violence concluded that the only sure way to reduce gun violence is to reduce sharp ly the number of handguns in civilian hands in this country we recognize this will be a massive and expensive task but the price is one that we should be prepared to pay in 1971 the commission on reform of federal criminal laws called fora ban on the production and possession of and trafficking in handguns with exceptions only for military police and similar official activities and registration of all firearms in 1973 in its report to president nixon the national advisory commission on criminal standards and goals recommended that each state take the following action the private possession of handguns should be prohibited for all persons other than law enforcement and military personnel manufacture and sale of handguns should be terminated existing handguns should be acquired by states handguns held by private citizens as collectors items should be modified and rendered inoperative most recently the attorney generals task force on violent crime called for stricter handgun controls how long are we going to lack the courage to do that we know is right i hopenot long i ask unanimous consent to

complex but its purposes are simple to reform outmoded and unworkable provisions of the present immigration law and to gain control of our national borders this is an historic occasion not only because of the significance of the bill itself but also because an identical bill is being introduced in the senate by senator alan k simpson of wyoming chairman of the senate subcommittee on immigration and refugee policy it is rare when a house and a senate subcommittee chairman agree to introduce an identical bill it is extraordinary when the chairmen are introducing such an identical bill on one of the most controversial subjects of our times it is even more extraordinary when the chairmen are from different parties and different regions of the country we have reached this point for two reasons first the issue of immigration is so important to our nation and the need to reform our laws is so pressing that all party and regional loyalties as well as differenaces must be transcended as elected representatives we must reflect the interests and concerns of those who elected us but we cannot also forget that on certain fundamental issuesnational defense foreign policy crime drug abuse and now immigrationthe importance of the subject requires a totally objective nonparochial approach the second reason we have come to this point in immigration reform is alan simpson he is an unusual man and an unusual senator he and his very capable staff have been a joy and a pleasure to work with during the past 13 months as we have studied this issue together before assuming the chairmanship last year as you all know senator simpson served as one of the members of the select commission on immigra tion and refugee policy chaired by my good friend father theodore m hesburgh president of notre dame my alma mater since becoming chairman of the senate subcommittee he has been extremely helpful to me and my staff and has been thoroughly cooperative as we have worked on this issue for the first time in 30 years our two subcommittees held joint hearings on the subject of immigration reform we have traveled together to study immigration problems most recently earlier this month to the state of florida we have traveled what i have termed the equivalent of the borscht circuit of immigration putting on our immigration today show at conferences such as one at williamsburg sponsored by the rockefeller and ford foundations and the conference at san diego sponsored by the san diego city club for these last few weeks we have had extensive detailed meetings on all aspects of the bill we are introducing today with a true dialog so that today we have a joint venture of which we are both proud what we are introducing today is a fair and equitable and workable and balanced bill neither of us is happy with each and every one of its provisions but we believe that as a whole it is the type of package that people who study this issue carefully will agree is the best approach to that most nettlesome of moral social economic and political of issuesimmigration senator simpson and i have traveled a long road to reach this point both of us have given exhaustive study to this issue right now i want to pay tribute to the six other members of my subcommitteesam hall of texas pat schroeder of colorado barney frank of massachusetts ham fish of new york dan lungren of california and bill mccollum of floridawho have participated in endless hours of hearings and meetings and acquired a firm understanding of this matter without them the product we have before us today would not have been possible i wish also to thank my professionally competent and personally devoted subcommittee staffharris miller skip endres peter regis gene pugliese and bonnie mcguirefor their fine help also i want to thank chairman peter w rodino jr of the full committee ranking minority member congressman robert mcclory and committee staff director garner cline for their consistent support let me review briefly what has transpired leading to the development of this legislation first the most recent three administrations have proposed major immigration reform presidents ford and carter and now president reagan have recognized the importance of immigration and all three proposed strikingly similar packages to deal with it all elements of earlier formulations are in the bill i am introducing the attorneys general who served under the three presidents i citedespecially our present attorney general william french smithdeserve spe cial commendation for their interest in immigration frankly as i told attorney general smith when he came before our subcommittee when they were wooing you to leave sunny california to come to washington i doubt that anybody bothered to advise you that the nettlesome immigration question would ue sitting there in the middle of your desk as the first of your many hot potatoes but to the attorney generals credit he has plunged into this issue with full dedication i hope he and the president will give their full and influential support to the bill senator simpson and i have drafted another element which helped produce our bill on immigration reform was the select commission on immigration and refugee policy which was established 4 years ago by congress and which just 1 year ago issued the most comprehensive report and set of recommendations on immigration since 1911 that commission was chaired by father hesburgh as i noted one of the most talented individuals of our age having chaired my own subcommittee in the study of this multifaceted issue for the past year i appreciate even more the talent of father hesburgh who was able to bring together so many diverse points of viewfrom eight members of congress four members of the previous administration and four public membersinto one comprehensive set of recommendations the work of that select commission has been invaluable to senator simpson and me in putting together our bill just as i believe that presidents ford carter and reagan will see a lot of what they recommended in our bill so do i believe that father hesburgh and the other commissioners will see a lot of their dedicated work reflected in our measure since becoming chairman of the house subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law last february i have spent more time on the immigration issue than on any other policy issue since my arrival in the house over 11 years ago my subcommittee held 12 days of extensive hearings on all aspects of immigration reform including as i noted earlier 4 days of joint hearings with senator simpsons subcommittee we have heard from witnesses from all walks of life we have heard the pros and cons articulated on every element of this bill even one who had never heard anything about immigration reform but took the time to read our hearings would quickly become a reigning expert on the issue senator simpson and i have not only learned from our hearings directed specifically to immigration reform but also from more generalized hearings on the operations of the immigration and naturalization service on the consular operations of the department of state on our refugee program and on other related immigration problems several of the problems dealt with in my bill were on private immigration bills highlighted in hearings i have conducted my subcommittee members and i have taken several major subcommittee investigative trips to places such as southern california florida mexico city southeast asia and europe reports of these trips have been published so others could obtain a more personal fceling for the issues before us finally we have had many private meetings with individurls concerned about immigration who have brought us information and insights which have proven invaluable in sum i do not think that anybody can say that we have not done our best to learn and understand i believe our bill reflects that the details of the bill senator simpson and i have prepared follow my remarks also to follow is a copy of a letter i addressed to the attorney general today dealing with the detention of haitians at the krome facility in miami suffice it now to say that i believe this bill to be fair balanced workable and equitable it should be enacted into law"], [0.4942856431007385, 0.5057143568992615, 1, "i thank

completion of that report it had been hoped originally that the conference committees on the social security bill would have met as planned this morning and that we would have the social security conference report tomorrow but this morning senator dole the chairman of the conferees on the senate side informed our chairman the gentleman from illinois that he could not meet today and would have to postpone that conference meeting until monday therefore the social security conference will not be ready tomorrow and we will have a pro forma session tomorrow on monday we will meet at noon and will consider the continuing appropriations resolution fiscal 1982 subject to the granting of a rule the rules committee will have to be meeting tomorrow in order to grant that rule inasmuch as the unanimousconsent request to consider that bill which was offered by the distinguished chairman the gentleman from mississippi was objected to therefore the continuing appropriations we assume will be

0.5055439472198486, 1, "i think we are all well aware of the crisis the social security system is facing indeed between use of social security as a political issue in this falls campaigns and anticipation of the longawaited report of the presidents commission on social security reform it has been impossible to forget about social security for long there is certainly no doubt that the fiscal crisis which has been predicted so many times is actually upon us as you know the retirement fund has had to borrow from the disability and medicare trust funds in order to send out its november and december benefit checks on time interfund borrowing is giving us the time we need to search for a solution but it is no substitute for comprehensive reform the newspapers have also told us that many young people are losing faith in the ability of the system to pay out benefits into the longterm future i believe this demonstrates a lack of confidence not just in social security but in the ability and the willingness of congress and the administration to deal with this issue in any substantive meaningful way it is essential not only for financial reasons but also to restore public faith that congress demonstrate the political courage to deal with this difficult problem we have heard a good many suggestions in recent months as to how best to solve social securitys problems but most of the proposals have this in common they are shortterm remedial measures designed to make up the systems immediate shortfall but to do little else most ould place heavy burdens on workers or retirees or both we must protect the current and future retirees who have paid into the system for many years cuts in benefits would cause especially severe hardships for the twothirds of recipients whose social security benefits are their sole or primary source of income likewise proposals to accelerate the scheduled increases in the payroll tax would have a severe impact on the young workers of today without guaranteeing that the system would still be available when they retire i believe we should view the current situation not only as a crisis to be solved but as an opportunity for major structural reform which will secure the retirement fund well into the future the social security system was established originally to pay pensions to retired workers and their dependents and to provide for their families in case of death americans now count on social security for many different kinds of assistance but i think most would agree that its primary purpose should remain the payment of retirement and related benefits if social security is to survive its current crisis and if the american people are to continue to believe in its future the system must be retuthed to this original conception i am today introducing legislation which will not only remedy social securitys shortterm financial difficulties but will also reform the system to insure its longterm fiscal integrity the basic thrust of this legislation is to provide for a gradual transition to do the following stabilize the retirement insurance program in its current form through the payroll tax and separate out the other major components of the social security systemdisability insurance and hospital insuranceby taking them off the payroll tax and onto a permanent trust fund supported by the general fund specifically this bill maintains the oldage and survivors insurance trust fund for the payment of retirement survivors and dependents benefits oasi will still be funded by the payroll tax but will have a separate account in the federal budget disability and medicare will be consolidated into one trust fund which will draw revenues out of the general fund oasi will be credited with whatever surplus remains in the disability and hospital trust funds and the amounts already transferred under the interfund borrowing program will not need to be repaid over a transition period covering the years 198390 the oasi trust fund will receive an amount of the payroll tax decreasing from 5 275 percent in 1983 to 5 2 percent in 1984 and 5 1 percent from 1985 on even under worstcase economic assumptions this tax schedule will build up a sufficient level of reserves to insure continued payment of retirement and retirementrelated benefits through the 1980s demographic trends in the 1990s are expected to favor social security meaning that the retirement program will be stabilized well into the 21st century immediate payment of disability and medicare benefits out of the general fund would obviously place a tremendous strain on an already overloaded federal budget next years budget deficit is projected to reach 200 billion and i do not think we can sanction any measure which would add substantial amounts to that staggering figure my legislation includes several provisions which will insure that during the transition period the federal budget deficit will not be adversely affected by the addition of disability and medicare benefits first over the 198390 transition period a specified amount of the payroll tax will be paid into the consolidated disability and health insurance trust fund to be used toward the pay ment of disability and medicare benefits this amount will increase from 1 425 percent in 1983 to 1 5 percent in 1984 1 95 percent in 198586 and 2 05 percent in 198790 under this system the total payroll tax will rise from its current 6 7 to 7 05 percent in 1985 and 7 15 percent in 198790 however the payroll tax is scheduled under current law to reach 7 05 percent in 1985 7 15 percent in 1986 and 7 65 percent in 1990greater increases than those contained in this legislation second in addition the projected 10percent tax cut due to be implemented on july 1 1983 would be reduced to 5 percent with theremaining 5percent setaside during the period 198390 into the consolidated trust fund i think it is important to point out here that the payroll tax is a regressive tax because it is a flat percentage taking a proportionately greater share out of the low or middleincome workers paycheck the income tax system on the other hand is designed to be progressive the h ther ones income the greater the ta rate use of an income tax base instead of the payroll tax thus spreads the burden of disability and medicare costs more fairly while the combined revenues from the special payroll tax and the income tax setaside will result in an increase in federal outlays in some years and a surplus in others the overall effects of revenues and outlays over the transition period will more or less offset each other current figures indicate that by 1990 this proposal will actually result in a net addition to the federal budget of 1 5 billiori finally this bill includes two additional reforms which i feel are important in the effort to insure longterm stability first social security ccverage will be extended to employees of nonprofit organizations federal employees who do not already have vested pension rights in the civil service or other federal retirement system and new federal hires this approach meets two consid erations it moves the system toward the universal coverage which was intended by its founders and it protects those federal employees who have paid into their own retirement systems in good faith and are already receiving or can expect to receive returns on those contributions second costofliving adjustments will be indexed to the annual increase in wages minus 1 percentage pointsthe average annual increase in productivityrather than to the consumer price index use of the wage index will stabilize the system by subjecting its beneficiaries to the same economic conditions as its working contributors the advantages of this legislation over other proposals currently under consideration are significant it does not cut benefits to current retirees or significantly restructure the benefits to be paid to future retirees it does not accelerate payroll tax increases indeed it scales those increases back and from 1991 on the new retirement fund is projected to remain stable with a 5 1percent tax rate with regard to medicare and disability i have long felt that these programs are better suited for general revenue financing than for funding through the payroll tax these are both extremely valuable and worthwhile programs and i certainly do not intend the federal governments commitment to the ill and the disabled to be weakened in any way however it is difficult to reconcile these programs with the earned wage benefit conception on which the retirement program was founded because unlike retirement these programs do not pay benefits to everyone who pays social security taxes use of a flat percentage payroll tax on all workers is appropriate for a retirement insurance program which pays benefits to all workers but insurance against disability and illness is best funded from other sourcep it simply is not equitable to ask low and middleincome workers who may never receive benefits from these programs to bear a greater share of their costs through a regressive payroll tax the measures currently under consideration by the commission constitute bandaid approaches to the social security systems problems they may succeed in patching up the shortterm financial crisis but they cannot be presented to the american people as a comprehensive solution i believe americans are willing to sacrifice in order to help insure the systems stability but at the same time they expect and deserve a responsible and humane approach to the systems problems this proposal provides such an approach it stabilizes the retirement program for all workers without asking any one sector to bear too heavy a share of the burden of change and it transfers the components of the system which are not available to all workers to general revenue financing i urge my colleagues to use this opportunity to institute this comprehensive and muchneeded reform"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5077195763587952, 0.5077195763587952, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i want to commend the gentleman from ohio for his patience and leadership on this legislation and alsothe staff who worked very hard the legislation now before us represents a great deal of work by the interior committee to perfect and fine tune a bill which authorizes federal aid in the reconstruction of the filene center theater at wolf trap farm park in virginia the filene center was orginally built over a decade ago with private funds it and the land upon which it sits in excess of 100 acres was donated to the federal government and is now a unit of our national park system operated by the national park service as the wolf trap farm park the wolf trap foundation works in close cooperation with the national park service and the foundation is principally responsible for providing the programs scheduled for the center the entire arrangement represents a close cooperative relationship between the government and the private sector after the catastrophic fire of last april which totally destroyed the center the administration proposed legislation which embodied a partnership in cost sharing between the government and the wolf trap foundation the center would be rebuilt on a 5050 cost sharing basis h r 6875 as initialy introduced embraced this costsharing approach the legislation before us while embodying a totally new text preserves that 5050 costsharing approach however the current bill text is much more detailed in the provisions of how this partnership will work it endeavors to more precisely define responsibilities timetables construction and performance standards and later operational arrangements for the overall park including the new center itself this bill is designed to provide the best working arrangements between the government and the foundation and hopefully protects with sensitivity and care the governments financial investment a great deal of credit for the wellthoughtout details of this bill is deserved by the chairman of the subcommittee on public lands and national parks the honorable john seiberling and particularly by his staff person loretta neumann the hearings and further staff investigations brought forth a great many details of concern and the bill provisions represent an effort to deal with these matters while i believe that both the bill and the committee report quite comprehensively address most matters related to the rebuilding there are a number of matters which i believe deserve further comment a significant concern has developed with regard to possible extraneous noise intrusion problems coming upon the center and adversely affecting the performances emanating from the nearby dulles road corriderairport access and yettobe constructed toll road in order to minimize that type of problem and also to minimize the extent and cost of mitigation effort to be undertaken by the highway interests it is crucially important that the site chosen for the reconstruction of the center be located in the best location within the park to separate it as far as possible from highway noise several alternate locations have been considered but the long favored choice of the foundation is to return to the original site some 300 feet from the existing highway corridor the alternate sites are farther distance from the corr dor there has been some concern that the foundation may desire a return to the original site more on a basis of sentiment than on a basis of it factually representing the best choice with regard to the most freedom from extraneous noise conflict it is crucially important that the federal investment here be amply protected by assuring that the most noisefree site be chosen unless the difference from other sites is only marginally better and or other factors such as increased cost strongly override such a choice the language of the bill section 4 d which gives final reconstruction decisions to the secretaryparticularly as to location and designwas strengthened by the full committee to emphasize this very concern and the feeling of the committee is strong and absolute that the secretary fully and purposefully exercise his authority here to assure that the final decision as to location and design for the center is made by him with total assurance that it is in the best interests of maximum reduced conflict with extraneous noise and maximum beneficial internal acoustical properties it well may be necessary for even more noise measurements analysis and evaluations to be made beyond those already completed in order to totally assure the proper conclusion as to the best location and design the department of transportation and the federal aviation administration should check this matter very closely as well as their interests have much at stake in the final center location and design decisions they will have to arrange and pay for necessary mitigation from unacceptable noise and they should help assure the minimization of such potential conflict and difficulties by assuring that the final reconstruction site is the best correlated to minimal noise conflict the final point i wish to make has to do with the cooperative relationship between the national park service and the wolf trap foundation which is so essential for the optimum operation of the overall park the bill provides for a cooperative agreement to constitute the basic document for setting forth this relationship and such an agreement is already in place at the moment and is working among other essential ingredients it is important that any new agreement address such subjects as both entities keeping each other totally informed of the others septemberf0 1982 planned public activities for the park in a timely manner the disposition and handling of food service and similar typically concession type operations the responsibility of all operational costs for all aspects of the park and the proper financial separation of the foundations parkrelated operations from its nonpark operations as it relates to the overall wolf trap farm park operation in regard to the latter it is important that the foundations operation of nonpark properties such as the barns be properly financially and otherwise separated from its governmentrelated wolf trap farm park operations to the extent there are current questions or problems related to these types of matters the current cooperative agreement should possibly be amended as i have already said i believe this is a good and responsible bill i urge my colleagues to lend their support to its adoption by the house i

speak out against the greatest threat to the health and wellbeing of mankindnuclear war there is no issue before the congress today which is more critical to our survival as a nation and as a civilization last year i introduced two resolutions calling for the elimination of all nuclear weapons the first house concurrent resolution 7 was introduced on january 5 and the second revised resolution house concurrent resolution 151 was dropped in the hopper with the cosponsorship of mr binoham in june both express the sense of the congress that all nuclear weapons should be eliminated the processcalling on the president to negotiate immediate substantial reductions in nuclear weapons on a bilateral basis with the soviet union subject of course to verificationis the same in both resolutions further the resolutions urge the president to call for an international conference of all nations with nuclear weapons in order to plan for the phased reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons througout the world house concurrent resolution 151 has over 60 cosponsors the freeze resolutions which have been introduced by many of my colleagues have over 100 cosponsors the people of the united states have also made it clear that they are concerned with the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear war recent surveys indicate that americans believe we should reduce nuclear arms i strongly believe that the only way to eliminate the threat of nuclear war is to remove the means of creating this ultimate disaster this is the goal which we all shareboth those that advocate a freeze and those who support negotiated reductions if it is true that the united states has a sufficient deterrent force to prevent a soviet nuclear attack then a freeze would be a viable option if on the other hand we would lose bargaining power and increase the threat of a nuclear war or political blackmail due to soviet superiority then we should consider negotiating to a level of equal deterrence before initiating a freeze i urge my colleagues on the foreign affairs committee to debate these critical issues in order to provide an opportunity for the house to express its views on reducing nuclear weapons i am extremely encouraged by the introduction of a resolution by foreign affairs committee chairman clem zablocki calling for strategic arms talks and verifiable negotiated reductions in soviet and american nuclear weapons his leadership on this issue is vital i am also gratified that president reagan plans to endorse bilateral negotiations to reduce nuclear weapons it appears that his statement may parallel the resolution introduced by senators jackson and warner calling for a freeze at equal and greatly reduced levels of nuclear forces i believe we should go beyond all of these proposalsto the actual elimination of all nuclear weapons even the least deadly warhead in use today is thousands of times more powerful than the bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki the destruction that would occur can be illustrated with an example that is very close to homethe consequences of dropping a nuclear bomb on the capitol imagine that we are sitting in this hallowed chamber debating vital questions of the day suddenly the civil defense alarm sounds it emergency call12 bells ring on the house clocks the speaker announces that we are under nuclear attack our much vaunted yet untested nuclear defenses fight off multiple and singlewarhead missiles in great quantity however three 5megaton bombs escape our counterattack and explode on a prime target the unitedstates captiol everyone in this room would be killed instantly by a huge silent heat flash traveling at the speed of light and all of capitol hill would collapse under a supersonic shock wave and winds of 300 to 600 miles per hour a similar fate would befall all living things around the perimeter of the beltway from the center of downtown washington to capitol hill everything would be vaporized leaving a crater several hundred feet deep a fireball over 1 mile in diameter would be created and would incinerate at a temperature of over 20 000 degrees farenheit anything that stood in it path within a 10mdie radius the vast majority of the metropolitan areas population would be killed by the blast wave 200mileperhour winds and fires over 40 percent of those left barely alive would suffer severe burns radiation sickness and traumatic in iuries since most medical facilitites would be destroyed and transportation would be impossible survivors would have no medical care food or water they would die a painful and lingering death as the fire from the bombs could turn into a 1 200squaremile firestorm cooking and asphyxiating even those in shelters survivors would be exposed to fallout and many would die within 2 weeks some may think that many people survived hiroshima and nagasaki and could survive a modern attack but the single bomb dropped on those cities had an explosive force of 15 000 tons of tnt the largest bomb today has the force of 20 million tons of tnt and even the smallest that would be used in nuclear war has the force of 1 million tons of tnt an allout nuclear attack with the launching of over 40 000 weapons by the united states and the soviet union would destroy every major population center in the two countries such an exchange could occur in only 60 minutes and would change the entire atmosphere ecosystem and life as we know it on earth scientists have pointed out that a loss of even 20 percent of theozone layer could blind every animal and insect and destroy our food base an allout exchange has been projected to destroy over 70 percent of the ozone layer i bring these stark facts to the attention of my colleagues to remind them of what utterly vicious and decimating annihilation the world would experience if a nuclear war ever occurred it is literally beyond the true comprehension of many people what perniclous potential we have created with the advent and continuing refinement of nuclear weapons i hope that this important discussion today can lead to a real solution to the threat of nuclear war i urge my colleagues to take the time to consider the realities of a nuclear holocaust it is something we cannot ignore we should join together to make certain that the horrible tragedy of nuclear war does not occur by calling for total nuclear disarmament e"], [0.5065449476242065, 0.5065449476242065, 0, "let me restate something that i stated when this debate opened this house must pass a budget resolution i think in a spirit of cooperation and i want to stress the cooperation in view of the fact of what we have pending in the spirit of cooperation i believe that we can pass a budget resolution that the country so badly needs i know there is going to be a lot of partisanship exhbited during the next several hours and maybe during the next couple of days but this is good it will point up the differences between the parties as well as the resolutions and we ought to point up those differences but certainly we have to keep in the back of our minds that we have to pass a resolution we have to pass a resolution with which we can go to conference we have to pass something that we can be proud of and something that will do the job that is needed to be done for the country i think most people in this chamber will agree that the biggest job we have before us is the matter of bringing down interest rates i heard some of the statements made earlier today about the chairman of the federal reserve mr volcker he cannot do it all himself the big problem is right here in this congress are we going to continue spending and spending and borrowing and borrowing and taxing and taxing this is a question we have to decide if we want to continue on the way of the past we are not going to bring interest rates down no way the package that i have presented here is a bipartisan package hammered out through several long hours and everything is not to my liking in that package if i had written the substitute all by myself it would be written differently in a good many areas but this is a consensus that we have arrived at we have heard a lot about cutting cutting there has been many stories printed in the newspaper and there has been a lot of talk over television that we are cutting the budget you know and i know we are not cutting spending from fiscal year 1982 even the budget the bipartisan budget substitute now before the house is 39 6 billion more more not less more than fiscal year 1982 we are not cutting from fiscal year 1982 we are adding to that spending it is a question of how much do you add how much can you add and still bring down those interest rates certainly i was pleased as was everyone looking at the financial page today to see that the interest rates have dropped a little bit just within the last day they have got to drop a lot more but i was pleased to see that treasury bills fell to 11 48 on 26year bills this is a good beginning it is good to know that several major banks cut their broker loan rate to 14 75 from 15 50 a move that could foreshadow a decline in the prime rate from 16 50 but certainly what is starting now is not going to continue if we say here in this house today tomorrow or the next day that we cannot reduce spending and borrowing we cannot resist that temptation to say yes yes yes to every request being made we are not going to bring down those interest rates on the contrary they will probably start back up i know my colleagues are going to go back home and say we are doing everything we can to reduce interest rates because it is hurting everybody certainly what we do here on this floor will have some influence i am confident of that but if we merely do a little tinkering here and a little tinkering there we are not going to accomplish much so we have to show the country and those people who are deeply involved with these interest rates that we mean business about reining in deficit financing the recovery package we have introduced on a bipartisan basis will have the best chance of bringing down interest rates it is 76 billion deficit reduction package which slows the growth of spending by 56 billion in fiscal year 1983 and adds 20 billion in revenues certainly it is a resolution which if adopted will slow the seemingly unquenchable appetite for government spending and will lead the country back to economic recovery i need not tell the members of this house that this package has the backing of the president of the united states as he expressed last night and has support on both sides of the aisle it is truly a bipartisan package this package spends less money overall than the other 2 plans that we will be considering later on it provides more money for the buildup of our national defenses which we started last year it also raises fewer taxes than either of the other two it protects the fundings for critical programs for the poor the elderly and the unemployed yes and it does provide a reconciliation date the others do not this bipartisan recovery budget calls for a minimum revenue increase over the next 3 years of 95 billion by contrast both of the other alternatives increase taxes by greater amounts during the next 3 years the jones or the committee version calls for 147 billion in tax increases while the socalled coalition or aspin package would increase taxes by 135 billion thato 135 billion tax increase in the coalition budget could cancel the 33 percent of the 3year tax reduction voted by the congress last year the bipartisan package would protect those individual income tax reductions made last year and which will be further reduced on july 1 this year by 10 percent and july 1 next year by another 10 percent when you add the social security tax increases scheduled for the next 3 yearsand the taxes called for in the aspin and jones budgetsit adds up to a 247 billion total increase in taxes for the american working person almost a quarter of a trillion dollar increase both the jones and the aspin budgets would mean either the elimination or deferral of the 10 percent individual income tax cut in july of 1983 they would also require reductions in the business tax incentives for investments productivity and jobs supporters of the coalition and jones budget will tell you their resolutions do not require doing anything with the individual mcome tax and business tax cuts they probably will say that specific revenue increases will be made by the ways and means committee true true but there is no way to raise the kind of money they are talking about without taking the measures i have just outlined why are their tax increases so high well because their spending is high because they insist on spending more and more money they must raise taxes if the coalition resolution revenue increases were cut back to the 95 billion level that is in our resolution it would mean a 40 billion increase in their deficit over 3 years so to reduce the deficit we will need to slow the growth of government spending the bipartisan recovery budget does that in a fair and a balanced way now let me point out at this juncture that we deal in aggregatesaggregatesin the budget committee we do not mandate anything other than those aggregates until we get to reconciliation and then we tell the committees how much money they have to raise or reduce their spending but we are merely showing the way as to how you can get to where we have to go let me say we freeze all nondefense discretionary spending programs at the 1982 level and then add back money for programs we believe additional spending is warranted and slow spending for programs we believe are growing too rapidly and not needed for example the bipartisan budget provides 139 million moremorefor compensatory education for disadvantaged children than does the jones budget we add 50 million more than the jones budget for handicapped education and 78 million more for education block grants we increase energy conservation spending by 166 million we spend 45 million more than the jones budget on vocational education we spend 217 million more on elementary and secondary education we spend 107 million more on ceta it provides 13 million or 59 percent more than jones for the energy regulatory activities it adds 23 million or 55 percent to jones for energy research it exceeds the presidents january request by 6 1 billion for medicaid 6 1 billion for medicald than was in the presidents request it provides for 3 7 billion or 68 percent more than the president requested for public assistance it adds 2 7 billion more than the president requested for guaranteed student loans now there have been a lot of stories being spread around this capitol buildingand that this is not unusualthat the bipartisan recovery budget cuts the funds appropriated in the 1982 emergency housing supplemental we heard a little about this earlier this simply is not true in fiscal years 1983 1984 and 1985 we have just as much for this program as do the other alternatives in the allowance function the letter from alice rivlin has been read but let me just point out that there was an error certainly by alice rivlin when we submitted that amount of money and she came back with a letter admitting her mistake furthermore our budget provides for 1 billion ginne mae tandem mortgages just as is contained in the house budget committee proposal this amount of money is contained in our housing function contrary to the erroneous reports being circulated also in the housing area authority our proposal contains exactly the same for farmers home administration as does the house budget committee proposal in our case funds are recorded differently because it assumes certificates of benefit ownership are to be sold to the federal financing bank which issues these loans in its own name once again erroneous information was issued which must be corrected we have received a letter from the cbo which admits an error was made in removing the 1 billion out of the resolution and this letter from alice rivlin has already been read so i am not going to take the time of the house to reread t we have however asked for and expect to receive a similar letter from cbo regarding the 1982 supplemental request under the entitlements entitlements are the fastest growing segment of the federal budget in this important area the bipartisan recovery budget achieves savings of approximately 34 billion more than twice the savings contained in the coalition package which calls for entitlement reform of only 16 billion the coalitions 16 billion in entitlements savings amounts to only 1 4 percent of the current law entitlement spending of 1 2 trillion the bipartisan resolution contains only 6 9 billion in entitlement savings in the first year certainly as you look at the amount involved we ought to have more savings than the resolution now before us contains 1 it contains more savings than either the other two propositions these savings are accomplished while still allowing full costofliving increases for social security railroad retirement benefits veterans pensions and compensation our proposal calls for cost of living increases to be capped at 4 percent for fiscal year 1983 and 1984 1985 i understand an amendment will be offered by the gentleman from virginia to give these federal employees and federal retirees the same cost of living as the individuals on social security railroad retirement benefits and others but our provision as far as capping these individuals i have mentioned the federal retirees and the federal employees is the same as the budget committee entitlement savings are critical and if we fall to slow their rapid increase and we are not doing much in any of these packages including the one now before us we are not going to be able to control government spending in the manner in which we should in the well of the house is one example of the tremendous growth in our entitlement programs this is hhs programs from 1950 to 1984 in 1950 we start up with only 12 5 billion we get to 1970 my colleagues can see that it is above 35 billion then it starts almost right straight up now we are up to 108 1 billion in 4 years a tremendous increase in this one department alone the bipartisan budget assumes some medicare savings here is someplace where a lot of misinformation has been put out by you know who in this chamber because every time you talk of any kind of savings they always try to bring in that the elderly people are going to get hurt nothing nothing in these savings is going to touch the recipient in any substantial way at all but savings we must have and the committee recognized that as does the coalition budget recognize some savings must be made in medicare medicare savings in our proposal over 3 years 3 years will be 23 2 billion compared to the coalition budget medicare savings of 9 4 billion without any reform at all in this one particular program medicare costs will total over 200 billion for the next 3 years to give the members some idea of the magnitude of this increase that is nearly as much as the entire cost of this program during its first 15 years of existence up to 1980 let me repeat that this 200 billion for this one program for the next 3 years 200 billion is nearly as much as the entire cost of the program durinf its first 15 years of existence from 1965 to 1980 now if anybody in this chamber or anybody in this country can live with that type increase and say nothing needs to be done i think they ought to rethink their position they do not know anything about the problem if they say nothing needs to be done but more needs to be done than is being done in the coalition package or in the jones package as i pointed out earlier they would only do something about 9 4 billion what do we propose the administration has proposed hospitalcost containment hospital costs have been increasingthis is what we are talking about the provider not the recipient as some have spread out across this country erroneously and i think it is unfair to the person paying his own billwe are talking about the taxpayers now i got a letter in my office this morning from a taxpayerhe is not on medicaretelling me how much his insurance costs his family he said i cannot afford it i cannot afford the cost for the insurance these medicare costs have gone out of sight and they have takea costs to others using hospitals with it hospital costs have been increasing at an annual rate of 14 2 percent since 1976 far outdistancing the consumer price index which rose by 9 8 percent during that period since 1967 hospital costs have increased more than 500 percent and medical care costs about 250 percent about noonday i spoke with the secretary of hhs do you have any idea how much hospital costs increased last year just last year nineteen percent a 19percent increase last year is there anything wrong with trying to get a handle on these skyrocketing costs i do not think so the people i talk with are complaining all the time about it by getting some kind of a handle on these costs we may reduce the costs to everyone the bipartisan resolution is a step toward getting these costs under control without let me emphasize thatwithout reducing benefits to the reciplents hospital cost containment initiatives assume no changes in the beneficiarys outofpocket costs but both the other alternative before us would permit excessive escalation of hospital costs to continue unabated since they only target 4 5 billion in savings over 3 years for new cost containment measures our resolution would also provide medicare savings in other areas of 9 8 billion not included in the jones or aspin budgets over 3 years how < k you get there let me mention just a few for starters by putting a cap on physicians fees in 1983 and allowing a 5 percent increase in 1984 we talk about capping everything else is it not fair to consider a cap here reducing reimbursements for radiologists and pathologists to the level applicable to all other physicians"], [0.5063688158988953, 0.5063688158988953, 0, "i would like to pick up on the remarks of the gentleman from illinois at the very outset for i come from a district where at caterpillar tractor co we have seen workers taking pay reductions john deere freezing company pay and the steelworkers taking 1 65 an hour in cuts plus fringe benefits that aggregate nearly 4 an hour under those circumstances i find it difficult to just roll over and acquiesce to this proposal to lift the 4percent cap on federal civilian retirees benefits that was imposed in our budget resolution particularly at a time when you have the cost of living index at less than 3 percent for 4 or 5 months running what better time is there for capping a cola not only for federal retirees but for federal pay both military and civilianwise i would go one step further to say if we could have done it across the board even social security recipients could have lived with a 4percent increase effective july 1 it is just too bad that we did not all have the guts around here earlier in the year when that was one of the issues that was supposed to be addressed by the socalled gang of 17 now it is amusing yet tragic that we are considering this legislation today without notice without ample time to prepare without an opportunity for us to respond it is amusing because it so typifies the election year politics which has governed the conduct of this house of months and it is tragic because it represents a repudiation of the budget process and the neglect of our responsibilities as so well pointed out by my friend from ohio i suppose i must say it was good of the majority to even allow us to share the time on an equal basis for the debate let me try to lay some groundwork for the vote then if i might quickly on the rule itself it is important that members of this house and the american people understand the issues in this debate and the consequences of what we do first the substance of the legislation reported out of committee is irrelevant the substance of the one amendment contained in the rule is totally irrelevant it does nothing it means nothing it is absolutely nothing this house does not have one single opportunity to vote on anything that complies with the reconciliation instructions of the budget or that meet the binding procedures of the budget act yet we are given two opportunities here to repudiate reconciliation and violate the intent and purpose of the budget act second it should be understood this action we take here today has absolutely nothing to do with the economic recovery but it has everything to do with political recovery what we are engaging in here is not fiscal responsibility but political irresponsibility we are using the floor of the house for the drafting editing and approving of campaign news releases that is really what it is all about compare what we should be doing with what we are doing we shoud be considering a reconciliation bill reported out of the budget immittee under a rule that offers opposing views to be aired and the opportunity then to vote on amendments or substitutes that reflect those opposing views that is how the process is supposed to work as i understand it what are we doing first we are abandoning the reconciliation process and leaving the budget committee completely out in the cold we are saying in effect that the budget process means nothing if it does not facilitate the majoritys political needs we are not considering reconciliation in the context of fiscal responsibility we are being forced to consider individual bills tailored to embarrass and frustrate those in this house who supported the budget resolution in june and admittedly it was practically a unanimous vote here a significant body of votes over here not the majority so we understand the politics of what game is being played here the very best we could do here today the only opportunity we have is to meet about 80 percent of the reconciliation instructions that is it some choice some democratic process some reconciliation it is all a sham the american people are being taken for a long ride down memory lane back to the days of the tax and spend and tax and spend philosophy i would urge my colleagues to vote down this rule rushed to the floor at first light today in the hopes of catch ing us still asleep i suppose this rule is an insult to the legislative process it is an insult to the budget process we have an obligation as a legislative body to fulfill the reconciliation instruction of the budget resolution those of us who still want to meet our obligations whatever the political consequences ought to be given an open and fair chance to do so those americans who believe that we must reduce the deficit through spending reductions should be allowed representation on this floor they deserve an upordown vote on real not phony reconciliation measures reference was made here a little bit earlier to a bill having to do with veterans benefits but the veterans committee matched the reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution that is the difference between that vote of yesterday or a few days ago and the vote today if the majority leadership wants to wash their hands of responsibility for implementing the budget that is all right with me but just give us a chance to implement it those of us who voted for it and thought we had a good product we will face the tough votes if the votes are presented fairly and if they are meaningful economic votes not just the fraudulent political votes like this one happens to be i would urge members to ivote down the rule and hopefully the previous question will not be adopted"], [0.5059718489646912, 0.5059718489646912, 0, "for those remarks because indeed this legislation is a matter of national security it is not only this year that the foreign assistance bill has direct implications for our national security that was true last year and the year before that and it is not only because this legislation authorizes military assistance for countries that are friendly to the united states that this bill has national security implications it is also because of the economic assistance that is authorized and the fact that this economic assistance is of equally critical significance to the political stability of third world countries and to american national security interests in those countries and weeks of the threat posed by libya in the african continent that is a very real threat libya has been harassing its neighbors for many years it has attempted to foment coups and unrest within its neighboring countries it represents in its conduct of foreign policy everything that is antithetical to the united~ states i understand and hope that there will be an effort made on the house floor during the course of the deliberations on this legislation to propose the consideration of economic sanctions that would be directed at libya i think those sanctions would indeed be an appropriate initiative by this government but the most important thing to understand is that the libyan threat in africa is not primarily a military threat that threat arises far more fundamentally from the economic resources libya has it derives from its oil and the capacity to use the earnings from oil to undermine and destabilize neighboring regimes i believe there is a growing understanding both in this country and abroad that the national security problems confronted by countries throughout africa latin america and asia are fundamentally not problems arising from threats of external aggression but rather threats arising from internal economic and social difficulties that are faced by these countries thesc are the problems which we are trying to help solve the the economic assistance provisions of this bill and the greater our success the more stable these countries are likely to be and the less vulnerable to outside interference by aggressors or troublemakers sudan is probably the classic example of that this foreign assistance legislation contains within it very substantial military assistance for the sudan in recognition of the military activities in which libya has been engaged but sudans fundamental problems are domestic and they are economic this is a country that has presently a budget deficit of 1 billion and a balanceofpayments deficit almost as large it now spends 60 to 70 percent of its foreign exchange revenues to meet its debt payments leaving little money for the task of economic and social development indeed sudan has the highest debt service ratio in the entire world and all the military assistance to that country is irrelevant to the fundamental issue in the sudan which is finding solutions to the critical economic problems that face the population and threaten to destabilize that government i we need as a country and as a government to begin to recognize that national security of countries in the third world is far more threatened by the economic and social difficulties these countries confront than it is by the prospect of external aggression there is one other proposition i would like to address very briefly we are frequently asked how can we possibly justify foreign assistance particularly at a time of domestic crisis in the united states the straight answer is that americas foreign assistance program directly serves americas economic and political interests it is not widely recognized for example that over 75 cents of every foreign aid dollar is spent in the united states it does not go overseas it is spent in the united states it is spent in the purchase of farm products from american farmers it is spent in the purchase of farm machinery from american business concerns it is spent in providing payments to american institutions and technicians in short most of the american dollars involved in foreign assistance find their way back to american citizens"], [0.5059432983398438, 0.5059432983398438, 0, "i rise in support of the grammlatta bipartisan substitute because it emnbraces the presidents program for economic recovery and represents a substantial departure from previous economic policies of higher spending and increased taxes last november 4 the american pcopole unmistakably recognized that it was these same policies which have led to sustained doubledigit inflation high unemployment and interest rates and a slowed national productivity growth i truly believe that unless we act now to change our past economic course these statistics based on the old policies of higher spending and taxation will continue to accumulate there are two very important reasons why i urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan substitute first it will restrain federal spenlding there can be no doubt that gloverment spending has literally exploded consider these facts payment of interest on the national debt for 1982 will almost equal the entire budget expenditures for fiscal year 1961 the national debt is more likely a national disgrace as it is currently just under 1 trillion washington presently spends 22 000 every second of every day in 1970 the government spent over 196 billion today we are considering a budget of 688 billion under the grammlatta substitute or roughly over 710 billion if all other proposed substitutes are considered by adopting the grammlatta bipartisan substitute we will restrain federal spending to 6 1 percent in 1982 as compared to previous spending growth of 16 percent from 1979 to 1981 federal spending and revenues will decline to 19 3 percent of gnp by 1984 as opposed to 23 0 percent and 21 2 p~ercent presently for 1981 furthermore the grammlatta substitute proposes smaller spending levels than has been proposed by any of the other budget alternatives being considered by the house by at least 21 billion in fact spending by the grammlatta substitute is 6 5 billion smaller than spending proposed by the administration the important point is that by adopting the grammlatta bipartisan substitute federal spending will still be larger than any prior year but it will be restrained many refer to the presidents proposal as cuttig the budget when actually all he is asking for is a reduction in the amount of increased spending for each year my second reason for supporting the bipartisan effort is that it leaves room for enactment of the reagan tax reform program which provides for sufficient tax relief to peopleespecially 97 million working peopleand to businesses the burden of taxes on individuals and businesses has become oppressive in 1965 only 6 percent of all taxpayers faced marginal tax rates of 25 percent or higher today almost40 percent of all taxpayers face rates of 25 percent or more the average worker must now pay his entire salary to taxes from january 1 to may 11 the previous administration estimated that tax receipts as a share of gnp would grow to the unprecedented level of 22 8 percent by 1984 ac cording to the house budget committee report page 31 in 1981 federal receipts are projected to exceed 21 percent for the first time since 1944 oliver wendell holmes jr once wrote the power to tax is the power to destroy the economic policies of the past several years have most certainly shackled american initiative and destroyed incentives to save work and investthe fundamentals of productivity the reagan tax plan relieves this tax burden first by keeping real taxes from increasing during the next few years and second by providing the necessary incentives to american workers and businesses to turn the economy around from a nogrowth situation to one of high growth president kennedy pointed this fact out in december of 1962 in a speech before the economic club of new york an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budgetjust as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits in short it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too lowand the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut rates now in the same way the reagan tax plan will reinvigorate the economy by restoring incentives for savings invest ment and entrepreneurship and by renewing optimism and confidence just as the kennedy tax cuts of 1964 and 1965 did enactment of tax relief in this form recommended by the president will allow the private sector to grow rapidly enough to provide new jobs without contributing to inflation and will restore the ability of the united states to compete effectively in world markets ilet us give the american people the new beginning that they voted for and still overwhelmingly support the administrations measures as embraced by the grammlatta bipartisan substitute will provide for a longterm foundation and commitment for stable fiscal and budgetary policy the federal budget will be balanced on economic strength and prosperity not artificially through increased taxes or spending we can no longer continue policies which wait and see before taking action president reagans fourpoint comprehensive package changes these past fickle economic policies one thing is certain if only a part of the package is passed by the congress we will get only a part of the solution as president reagan addressed the nation on february 5 1981 its time to recognize that weve come to a turning point were

gentleman for yielding as a member of this committee i fervently support its important continuation the pandemnic magnitude of this deadly traffic would make nonsupport of this resolution unconscionable i wish to associate myself with the remarks of my colleagues in support of house resolution 13 which will reconstitute the select committee on narcotics abuse and control i believe the need for persistent congressional input into the formulation of domestic and international narcotics control policy cannot be understated and it is clear to me that the select committee is an essential mechanism in this regard in the 4v 2 years that the select committee has been in existence it has produced a long list of solid achievements the committee has addressed a plethora of narcoticsrelated problems that often impact upon the very fiber of our society hearings on pcp and prescription drug abuse the health hazards and therapeutic uses of marihuana the special problems of drug abuse among women the elderly and minorities as well as hearings covering international narcotics control and specific regional drug problems have been held in 1979 i had the privilege of chairing a series of hearings which examined both the physical effects and trafficking of cocaine all of these hearings and investigations have provided the congress and the public with invaluable insight into the role that drugs have come to play in our society today an insight i submit we might not have had if it were not for the exemplary work of this committee in addition there are a number of issues that i think might not have come to light at all without the presence of this committee the select committee has been the principal catalyst in creating a public awareness of the extent to which our nations armed forces are plagued with a very serious drug abuse problem hearings and study missions conducted by the committee prompted the department of defense to begin coming to terms with this dilemma i want to reminj my colleagues that this issue calls into question the very nature of our military preparedness our ability to meet an external threat and retain the blessings of liberty that have been bestowed upon us it seems to me that the praiseworthy effort to improve our defensive capabilities undertaken by president reagan is unquestionably undermined if the united states cannot even maintain a drugfree midlitary force i suggest that one of the most effective steps we can take here today to enhance the prospects of the presidents attempts to improve our defense posture would be to vote in favor of house resolution 13 this would insure that the defense department continues to have the proper oversight that they will need to implement programs to solve this problem one of my great concerns is the increased influx of southwest asian heroin into the united states the impact of this highgrade heroin has already been felt in the northeast i believe this surge in the production of southwest asian opium and its subsequent refining and trafficking out of the region as heroin represents the clearest and most present drug danger to our global society today given the implications of a fullfledged heroin invasion of our shores it seems to me that this is hardly the time for the congress to signal the world that we are no longer as committed to dealing with this dilemma by eliminating this bodys only committee with sole jurisdiction over narcotics problems my concerns rest not only with southwest asian heroin but also with the truly global dimensions of drug abuse just recently i had occasion to review the newspaper headlines of countries from the far corners of the earth and was struck with the persistence of the drug abuse theme one of the major dailies in jakarta indonesip ran a story in november entitled drug related offenses increase in 1980 in namibia an article reviewing the widespread increase in drug trafficking was published le figaro one of the largest french newspapers ran a series of articles late last year regarding drug abuse increases and police fears of a new french connection a hong kong daily published a story which indicated that the heroin seizures of 1980 were double that of 1979 new zealand norwegian and british papers all recently ran stories regarding increasing drug problemsand i could go on and on the point is that all of these stories present us with a composite picture which suggests that there are universal drug abuse problems and this is certainly not the proper time for the congress of the united states to take the heat off by eliminating the select committee on narcotics a few years ago the use of paraquat to eradicate marihuana in mexico grew into a highly emotional and contentious issue whichi had the potential of raising grave uncertainties regarding not only the integrity of our mutual efforts to restrict the flow of marihuana into this country but our entire bilateral relationship with mexico as well the select committee in fulfilling its mandate held a series of hearings and issued a report which shed the light of objectivity on this sensitive issue and encouraged the federal government to rethink its position in light of wider bilateral commitments visavis mexico i might add that the select committees involvement in this issue represented the only attempt in the congress to examine all facets of this highly complex subject the revelation of drug abuse as a global problem has only recently come to the forefront just as prior to the establishment of the select committee international narcotics control policy was accorded such a level within the state department that the issue was only rarely raised as one of vital national interest thanks to the impetus of the select committee in 1978 the state department created the bureau of international narcotics matters this action insured that narcotics will be considered an integral part in the development of american foreign policy although there remains much to be done to continue to raise the profile of narcotics on a global scale i believe the commnittees influence in this matter constitutes an outstanding accomplishment in todays atmosphere which is f avorable to budget cutting a sentiment that i have long been in accord with it is imperative that we review the cost effectiveness of programs concomitant with financial prudence is the ability to expend money in a manner which has the potential of producing future profits i believe that the estimated 500 000 per

if you vote for my contract or to keep my base open ill vote for yours works only to the detriment of our genuine defense needs and has led to the underfunding of readiness that i have already

project while readinesstraining spare parts ammunition supplies operations and maintenance take a back seat everyone loves to take the well of the house to display a model of a new plane or missile when what we really need are more bullets and more hours of training we must also understand that defense spending cannot be infinite and that cost issues simply must be addressed our gnp is only so great and if we are going to make the investments necessary to expand itwhether they be in physical plants education scientific research job training energy development or the assurance to our citizenry at large that their participation in this effort will not result in destitution and wantthen we cannot in the short run expand our defense effort to the point where these other needs which are also necessary to our ultimate national security are neglected ultimately a healthy economy is more critical to our national security than the level of defense spending i had planned to offer an amendment today that reduced the totals appropriated in this~ bill for procurementexcept spare parts repair parts and ammunitionand r d by 3 percent i understand the gentleman from georgia will be offering a similar amendment at the 2 percent level and i have decided to support his effort i proposed my amendment because i feel the emphasis by the administration on procurement will beggar the unitedstates treasury bankroll costly unnecessary procurement programs and ultimately starve the most crucial areas of defense spending those relating to military readiness without making choices in determining our mix of strategic gadgetry the pentagon will ultimately be forced into the timehonored means of cutting defense costs chipping away at 0 m already we have seen the beginnings of this the centerpieces of the reagan defense package are the very costly bi and mx and the slight cutbacks in defense spending have come in 0 m i would like to focus on one area of defensestrategic nuclear forceswhere we as a nation must make some choices until recently our defense system has been based on the simple theory that a triad of nuclear retaliatory forces seabased airbased and landbasedwould stretch the soviets weapon systems thin but the unitedstates strategic forces is now working on a pentad not a triad we have five nuclear responses going landbased icbms submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms manned penetrating bombers airlaunched cruise missiles and sealaunched cruise missiles i particularly question the mx missile first a fixedsite missile makes no sense as a second strike weapon as former secretary of defense harold brown said recently all fixedsite targets will be vulnerable by the end of this decade second hardening existing silos to 5 000 psi will not make the mx invulnerable because slight increases in soviet missile accuracy or payload greatly offset increased hardness as does an increase in the number of warheads deployed against a site as was the case with the racetrack basing mode proposed by president carter absent the ratification of salt ii the hardened silo basing mode is simply not survivable consequently we still lack a credible mx basing mode and it is hard to see how one can design the missile itself without knowing its basing mode do we really want to spend 1 9 billion on a missilewhose predecessor was justified only under the terms of salt iibut whose current incarnation is supposedly justified only by the abandonment of salt 11 though i think there is a much better case for the bi thani for the mx on balanceand with some hestationi have decided that i cannot support the bi the basic case for a manned penetrating bomber is that after the soviets have fired a first round at our missile sites and we have responded the soviets will have mobile targets against which only manned penetrating bombers will be effective pla~inly the bi would be better for this mission than the b52 to some degree because of its smaller radar profile to a larger extent because it requires shorter runways than does the b52 and so theoretically could be dispersed over many more airports than could the b52s thus presenting more targets than soviet first strike capability could handle yet as a practical matter it is hard to conceive a nuclear war scenario under which the b1 with nuclear weapons would actually get to all those small town airports to fly again in any organized response against the soviets i am also troubled by the secretary of defenses own admission that the first bi squadron will not be ready to fly until 1987 but will not be able to penetrate soviet air defenses past 1989 or 1990 i strongly believe we should be focusing on cruise missiles and improving the accuracy and command control of slbms while the soviets can probably ultimately defend hardened small sites against cruise missiles the expense ratio is probably in our favor and they seem the best way of closing whatever short run window of vulnerability may exist in the long run it appears that the soviets have more of window of vulnerability than we because of the vulnerability of any fixedbased missiles on which the soviets have relied heavfl1y and our lead in slbms and submarine hiding and detection in fact unitedstates superiority in this area should make us invulnerable for many years to come to close let me repeat that we must make choices in our procurement of strategic weaponry failure to do so will harm our actual defense posture by starving 0 m not to mention as well as the unitedstates treasury i believe the best choices for elimination are the mx missile and the bi bomber i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting improved defense readiness while making some effort to eliminate the pork barrel approach to

melodramatic each of us should recognize that later today we will last one of the most important votes in recent history while the consequences of our actions are sta gering the choice is clearthe tvine is now to pass the reagan bipartisan tax bill on the one hand we have a bill written by the overly partisan ways and means committee a bill which calls for a 2year 15percent reduction in tax rates tax rates which they over the years have caused to rise and take a larger portion of the paychecks of every man and every woman working today on the other hand we have a bipartisan tax proposal which not only reduces taxes 25 percent acrosstheboard for all americans during the next 3 years but permanently eliminates the builtin tax increases caused by inflation before discussing why i feel the reagan bipartisan tax plan provides real tax relief while the ways and means committee bill calls for actual tax increases in the years ahead we should recognize that the ways and means committee bill was drafted by a group of men who are much better at raising taxes than they are at reducing them in fact they are so good at increasing taxes that they have done so at a rate of 249 percent since 1971 since that time the ways and means committee has given the american people five other socalled tax cuts yet over the same 10 years total taxes increased by more than 400 billion it is interesting to note that it took this nation 200 years for washington to extract 300 billion annually from the private sector yet from 1977 to 1981 the ways and means committee was able to more than double that figure yet these same revenueraisers who only a short time ago said the american people were not entitled to a tax cut now are saying that they have the right tax bill for the american people the american people have been down that briar path before and they recognize that the ways and means committees bill is just another tax increase masquerading as a tax cut there is a better path we should travel and i urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting the presidents bipartisan tax plan while there has been much debate about which of the proposals provides real relief to the individual taxpayer the aimple fact is that under the presidents bill all american households will experience decreases in their tax rates after 1981 conversely by 1984 under the ways and mreans tax bill working people in nearly every tax bracket will be paying more taxes than they paid in 1980 and will be faced with whopping tax increases in the years to come the presidents tax proposal is imminently fair in that it provides tax relief to those americans who pay the majority of taxes for those americans who earn between 10 000 and 60 000 and now pay 72 percent of total individual taxes in america the presidents plan will provide 74 percent of the benefits to them in addition it will relieve taxpayers of 98 percent of the tax increase expected over the next 4 years due to inflation and wvill eliminate bracket creep after 1985 it is refreshing to have at long last a president with the courage to end this unlegislated unvoted unsigned and unending tax hike on the american people regrettably however the ways and means committee lacked that courage and their bill does not include a provision to index our tax code this i believe is but another example of their true intentions to continue to raise the level of taxes on all working americans in 1963 president kennedy said the final and best means of strengthening demand among consumers and business is to reduce the burden on private income and the deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present tax system this administration pledged itself last summer to an acrosstheboard toptobottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes with this in mind president kennedy sent to the congress just as president reagan is doing now a tax bill to significantly reduce marginal tax rates for all americans president kennedys proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the congress which included the current speaker of the house and chairman of the ways and means committee it was hailed by the thenchairman of the ways and means committee wilbur mills as a proposal to remove the private sector of the american economy from its hightax straitjacket to breathe into ourfree enterprise system that vitality that we concluded it requires if it is to do the job required of it today yet today t~he same individuals who voted in favor of the kennedy acrosstheboard tax cuts are saying it is unwise potentially inflationary unworkable and dangerous to give americans this type of tax relief i say their opposition is politically motivated and not based on any sound economic principles in the 7 months that i have been a member of this distinguished body i have held 32 town meetings in my district i have made 52 speeches i have attended 31 special events and i have met hundreds of other individuals of every age race occupation and income without exception those with whom i have talked want to keep more of their paycheck andthey want to have the freedom to save or spend their hardearned moneythe way they wantand not as washington dictates in my congressional district the median family income is 11 800 under the reagan bipartisan tax plan individuals earning this income will get to keep 917 more of thier dollars conversely under the ways and means bill they will keep only 527 of their dollars while this alone is significant this is not the whole story for as we all know the befiefits of the reagan bipartisan plan will continue in the years ahead long after the ways and means committee bill not only has run out of gas but has guaranteed all taxpayers huge tax increases the presidents bipartisan tax bill will provide 205 million in savings to my congressional district and 1 4 billion in new income to the city of houston i firmly believe that similar tax benefits are available to every community every town every city and every congressional district in this nation that is the central goal of the reagan bipartisan tax proposal which is in my judgment the best opportunity we have to encourage more employment higher real incomes fewer lives wasted on welfare and a rekindling of the work effort and entrepreneurial spirit in our nation instead of working to pay taxes people will be working for themselves and their families once again and upward mobility will return to american life finally i would say to my colleagues that if you want to continue to support the misguided tax policies of the past which have given us persistent doubledigit inflation high unemployment negative productivity the lowest savings rate of any industrialized nation and one of the highest tax burdens in our historythen you should support the ways and means committee bill if you want however real economic growth and real prosperity for your constituentsthen you have no real choice but to

hearing when epa has proposed to retain a pesticide by additional restrictions on its use rather than canceling its use section 6 b of fifra entitles persons adversely affected by a proposed cancellation action to challenge this decision in an administrative hearing epa in reviewing registered pesticides for possible unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment through the rpar process has utilized the risk benefit analysis as a result in many cases is able to continue the use of pesticides by incorporating restrictions such as usage limitations improved application directions or more emphatic label warnings epa in 1979 made an administrative decision in interpretation of adversely affected that only registrants and users of pesticides which are those with an economic interest in the continued registration of a pesticide were entitled to a hearing under section 6 b the public interest groups although they may have participated in the rpar process still feel they should be able to demand an administrative hearing to challenge this type of action saying it has not gone far enough and that in effect the pesticide use should be canceled the public interest groups unsuccessfully challenged this administrative ruling in court the court ruled that congress intended to provide an administrative hearing only when a pesticide use is being canceled not when its use is being retained conditionally since the public interest groups have an input in the rpar process and have the opportunity to appear before the fifra scientific advisory panel all before the final decision is made and then may challenge this refusal to cancel in federal district court under the provision of section 16 a i feel that adequate safeguards have been provided and this amendment should be rejected i might point out that the subcommittee considered this proposal during its deliberations and determined that such language was not needed for those who are more interested in the details of this issue i will continue further the rosenthal amendment to section 6 b of fifra provides that whenever epa proposes to place regulatory restrictions on a product any interested person may compel epa to hold a courtroomtype cancellation hearing for the purpose of determining whether even greater restrictions should be imposed on the product than those epa decided on my prob lem with this amendment is not with its underlying conceptthat any interested member of the public should be able to request stricter regulatory action my problem is with the procedure chosen to do thisthe formal courtroomi ype cancellation hearing a cancellation hearing is a lengthy timeconsuming resourceconsuming piece of litigation it is simply bad law and bad policy to make cancellation hearings the vehicle for regulatory decisions as to how strictly pesticides should be regulated yet that would be the primary effect of the rosenthal amendment i believe that all interested persons should have an input into epa decisions as to how strictly to regulate pesticides but as i will show that opportunity is already provided under current law during the administrative review process because cancellation hearings under section 6 b are really formal litigation they serve a very narrow purpose it would be a grave mistake to adopt the rosenthal amendment and thereby turn them into something they were never intended to be and that is essentiallyunworkablea forum for deciding how strictly to regulate pesticides the issue raised by the rosenthal amendment is not whether environmental groups should have the same right to demand a cancellation hearing under section 6 b as a pesticide registrant that is a false issue rather the issue is what is the proper time and place for the public to have input on how strictly a product should be regulated is the proper procedure as i contend for the public to make its beliefs known during the agencys regulatory review process or is the proper procedure as mr rosewhal contends to decide regulatory issues through administrative litigationthat is to let any person demand that a formal courtroomlike cancellation hearing be held to redecide how strictly to regulate a product whenever a person feels that epa has not been strict enough i believe that cancellation hearings under section 6 b should not be the forum for redeciding regulatory issues the proper time for the public to comment on how strictly to regulate a product is during the administrative review process if anyone thinks that epa was not strict enough after an administrative review that person has the right to take epa to court under section 16 a of fifra and ask the court to review what epa has done cancellation hearings serve the narrow purpose of giving a registrant a right to due process of law if his product is going to be canceled they should not be expanded as proposed in the rosenthal amerdment into a device for deciding anew epa decisions that a person does not like i believe the logic of my position becomes even more clear when one understands the different purposes served by administrative review on the one hand and by cancellation hearings on the other epa decisions as to whether to impose restrictions on a product or even cancel a product are made in an administrative review process called an rpar rebuttal presumption against registration every person has a full right to participate in this regulatory process and to urge that a product be strictly regulated and to provide to epa any data or arguments in support of his position if the person feels that epa has not been strict enough at the conclusion of the rpar he can sue epa in federal court and obtain review of epas decision this is in fact made crystal clear in an amendment in h r 5203 to section 16 of fifra concerning judicial review in summary epa has found based on many years of experience that the administrative review or rpar is the best procedure for deciding how strictly to regulate and that is the proper time and place for the public to participate and express its views on how a product should be regulated in contrast a cancellation hearing under section 6 b serves a very different and narrow purpose when epa proposes to cancel a product the registrants and other adversely affected persons can request a formal hearing to protect their procedural right to make sure that the cancellation is carried out in accordance with due prdcess of law cancellation hearings are very rare very expensive for the taxpayer very time consuming and resource consuming and very burdensome on epa there have been only a handful of such hearings since epa was created in 1970for ddt aldrin and dieldren heptachlor and chlordane and 2 4 5t they typically last for a minimum of 6 months and can take years to complete they consist of an administrative trial conducted in the same manner as a trial in federal court they require the public to foot the bill for the time of a team of agency lawyers and administrative law judge they take epa scientists away from their duties and require them to spend time testifying and in crossexamination for periods of days or weeks because cancellation hearings are rare they are an acceptable procedure for protecting registrants due process rights to a hearing but they are clearly an ineffective and undesirable mechanism for making routine decislons as to how strictly epa should regulate particular products they result in legal decisions made by lawyers and administrative judges not in regulatory decisions made by epa scientists and policymakers if the rosenthal amendment were adopted epa would be inundated with these cancellation hearings the amendment would give extraordinary power to a single individual to tie up epas regulatory resources in unproductive litigation a single person could demand a hearing on virtually every epa regulatory decision and force epa to spend months or years trying its case before an administrative law judge after the agency had alfeady fully considered the evidence and reached a decision through its administrative review this clearly would be unwise the law should stay as it is the public should provide its input during the administrative review at the time when epa makes its regulatory decisions if a cancellation hearing is held of course the public should continue to have the right as it does now to participate in it and the public should continue to have the right as it does now to get judicial review of epa regulatory decisions but a person should not be able to tie epa in knots by demanding that lengthy and expensive cancellation hearings be held whenever they feel that epa has not been quite strict

of the ocean dumpsite environmental impact statements as a result of an outofcourt settlement in a case arising from a national wildlife federation suit therefore this additional money is necessary to recognize this accelerated completion schedule the subcommittee on oceanography held 1 day of hearings on this additional administration request for title i and the committee was satisfied that these
