20th marks a special anniversary for all freedom loving people of the world for it is the annivarsary of the independence of the republic of cuba it is cubas fourth of july yet instead of a true celebration there is nothing but sorrow this 20th of may for the cuban people for this date marks just another year of brutal repression another year of tyrannical rule another year pf total lack of liberties another year of suppression of democracy just yesterday the miami herald published this interesting one line article cuba two cuban dissidents paula valiente and juan guarno on monday were given a 1year suspended sentence for calling an alternative may day rally in havana official sources said the mere announcement that you are calling for a rally is enough to get you arrested tried and convicted the freedom that we take so lightiy here in the united states is a cause of criminal sanctions in cuba how much further proof is needed that cuba is a horrid police state there are dozens of reports from international human fights groups which have carefully documented the continued abuses of the castro regime there are dozens of studies which have proven that the repression of dissidents is increasing in cuba i have here just three such reports first the country reports on human rights practices for 1992 as prepared by the department of state second the report by amnesty intemational and third the human rights watch world report for 1992 written by americas watch all carefully analyze the totalitarian stats of cuba dominated as the stats department points out by fidel castro who is president chief of state head of government first secretary of the communist party and commanderinchief of the armed forces in every category castros abysmal record stands out in the category of respect for human rights the following are included in the state department report political and extrajudicial killing torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment arbitrary arrest detention or exile denial of fair public trial and arbitrary interference with privacy family home or correspondence in all of these areas fidel castros cruelty to the cuban people seems to know no bounds in the next section of the state department report labeled respect for civil ubertles the list of abuses is equally repugnant for there is no freedom of speech and press no freedom of peaceful assembly and associationremember what happened just on monday a conviction for trying to have a rally that was not sanctioned by the castro regime no freedom of religion and no freedom of movement within the county foreign travel immigration or reparation in the other sections of the report the tragic story of cuban people is repeated no respect for political rights no right of citizens to change their govemment and no right for international and nongovernmental nvestigation of human rights violations workers rights are also ignored there are no independent unions no collective bargaining exists there is no prohibition on forced labor and any child 11 year old and above is expected to work 8 hours a day in the summer in farm labor as every credible report points out there are no basic civil and political rights and peaceful dissenters are routinely imprisoned for trumped up charges of incitement and rebellion by law merely insulting castro means a 3year

to 400 billion or 500 billion in new taxes without really substantially reducing the debt and the deficit or are we going to get control of spending in this house and balance the budget and get on

growth and would have cut 848 billion in pork and waste out of government spending that is what the american people want they would not even allow us to debate it on the floor they literally gagged the minority so we could not even debate it because they wanted to ram through president clintons proposals of 402 billion in new taxes and fees 180some billion in new spending the only cuts they were talking about were in the area of defense and over a 5year period instead of balancing the budget or a 7year period we were going to end up with an additional 240some billion a year in deficit as the gentleman from florida so aptly put it instead of the debt and the deficit going down by 1998 we would have a minimum of 6 trillion national debt we believe many of us believe that that national debt by the year 1998 or 2000 is going to be between 8 trillion and 13 trillion if that occurs the interest alone on the national debt will be well above half of all the tax revenues coniing in if that ever occurs we are going to have them printing money to pay off a lot of the debt so we do not have to pay interest on it and we could very well have hyperinflation we could have bread costing 320 a loaf and milk costing 200 a quart because we do not get control of the spending problem around this place that is a direct result of the committee on rules controlled by the democratic majority not

trash thecongress you incite a lot of people to write and they expect to be answered every member in here answers their mail it is a tremendous workload that we have here it would be beyond me even though i do not use all of my frank i do not use all of my clerk hire i think it is a cheap shot for me or anybody else to tell another member from california oregon or washington or whatever how much money it is going to take to do an adequate job for his constituents and for himself that would be very presunmptuous of me and i think it was very hypocritical some people that make these statements are so narrowminded that a gnat can sit on the end of their nose and drink water out of both sides at the same time i think it is ridiculous for us to continue to trash this house when members are trying to do a good job for their constituents"], [0.4994264841079712, 0.9994264841079712, 1, "it is a most unusual day for me i have been here 9 years i continue to be amazed thedemocrat party can pass a rule calling for the biggest tax increase in our history but we could not carry a rule to provide disaster relief in america now that makes me wonder i now get on with the purpose of my speech here i oppose the rule on the transportation appropriations bill for the following reasons there are 58 projects worth 305 million in this bill that never came to the public works committee i want the committee on energy and commerce i want the small business committee i want every committee in the house to listen to this because this is not just a transportation issue this is an issue on whether or not you should even be in the congress i would not oppose one of these 58 projects if they came to our committee but they did not and the word is if you want a project you go see the appropriators now the rule and you did a wise thing protecting this bill from points of order because you would have had this bill dismantled the democrat party wants to straighten out and provide some reform the rules of the house say before you can spend any money you have to approve it and have a hearing you need no hearings on appropriations that are not authorized the house rules are a joke we have a 2year budget we have 1year deals we do not even authorize around here i say to all the members of authorizing committee unless you want to turn over your voting card and your manhood to the appropriators vote no on the rule i have an amendment that will be legislating on an appropriations bill and i would appreciate is being accepted"]]}
