basketball program of course unc chapel hill is a fine school with an excellent academic reputation the university consistently ranks among the nations top public institutions and last year it joined harvard and stanford as the only schools with prestigious rhodes luce truman and goldwater scholarship winners it sure is nice to also be among the nations athletic elite the unc team knows what it is

making those tax cuts permanent do for the american people well in my state of north carolina between now and 2014 we would produce 22 000 new jobs because of extending and making permanent the presidents tax cuts our annual gdp would grow by over 111 billion higher after inflation if we make the presidents tax cuts permanent personal savings will grow by 163 billion per year on average over

a twostep process and that ispassage of this cord blood bill which as i said we passed last may in this house by an overwhelming vote the second step of course will be when the other body passes h r 810 which also passed last may and when that bill is finally signed into law the two bills working together will greatly expand availability of research and of cures for americans who suffer not just from bloodrelated diseases but from diseases like alzheimers parkinsons nerve damage and so many other diseases that cannot be reached simply by cord blood that is the day that a true dawning of a new scientific era will occur in this country this is a good bill today and i urge all of my colleagues to support it and i want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their cosponsorship but let us be clear exactly what this bill does it authorizes a new granted program to provide subsidies to cord blood stem cell banks to expand the inventory of high quality cord blood units it sets up a registry for cord blood which will in some cases take the place of bone marrow transplants which it is beginning to supersede this will be enormously important particularly for sickle cell patients who will be helped the bill also authorizes research on the clinical outcomes of patients who are recipients of a stem cell therapeutics product from biologically related and unrelated donors that is what this bill does this bill does not set up any cures for any diseases nor does it do anything to put ethical controls onto stem cell research and other types of research that are scientifically being explored now and need the oversight of the national institutes of health so this is a good start i commend all my colleagues it is going to make us all feel good to go home for the holidays knowing that certain classes of patients will be helped but i would say to my friends on both sides of the aisle let us not stop there in the second session of this congress let us take the bold scientific step necessary to provide cures for diseases that affect tens of millions of americans and citizens around the world i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.4983000159263611,

responders it was a sad day for all of us the wonderful thing was that america again came together the wonderful thing was that the communities came together to be there for the families what i would like to talk about is that we have forgotten though the heroes we have forgotten those that have physical injuries still today and certainly health care issues that they are facing but i also would like to talk about the children the children that lost their parents i have a wonderful center in my district called the world trade family center and it has been a godsend for so many of my families that come there on a weekly basis that children sometimes even more receive psychological friendship care training foi their parents on how to deal with grief because i know a lot of times people dont know how to handle their grief but i think the thing that bothers me more is that with the world trade family center they dont have any more money i am scrounging around to try to find grants to keep this center open because a lot of times people dont understand that when you go through a tragic event like 9 11 the first year the second year basically you are just on automatic reflex it is the third and the fourth year that it starts to sink in on whats happened to them and their families and how their lives have changed forever you know everyone keeps saying we will never forget well unfortunately we are forgetting when i see my first responders come into my office they are having an illness that is taking them away from their job and many of these men and women are very young but because they were there for 9 11 and the weeks that followed and a lot of my union workers that were down there cleaning up with all of their heart and soul trying to find survivors and then just recovery we as a nation say that we will always be there for you and yet the money has run out i think this nation this country the american people who gave their hearts and souls after 9 11 by donating blood donating their time sending money into all the different organizations and that money was used and it was used in a very good way but when i look at the world trade family center that looks like it is going to be closing its doors because it doesnt have the funding and it is just starting to reach the children you have to understand the children and you have to understand victims a lot of times they wear masks so that if somebody says how are you doing they automatically say i am doing fine i am doing okay if you ask a child they will say i am doing okay i can tell you from experience they are not doing okay but my concerns for the children because they are just coming to grips now realizing that their father or their mother is never going to be there again they do a lot of art therapy there and i have back in my district office a number of paintings that our young children have done i brought with me today three drawings by three children who lost their parents i know it is hard to read and even harder to see but these children are still feeling pain and they are going to be feeling pain for a long time we as americans must realize that what happened on 9 11 doesnt go away even in 1 years and it doesnt we as americans have to come together to be there for most that unfortunately are suffering today under no fault of their own we as americans i know keep giving but it is also my opinion the responsibility of congress to make sure that we take care of these people jerry nadler a colleague of mine from new york and certainly hillary clinton and chuck schumer my senators from the senate have been fighting to make sure that there are funds there to be taken care of and yet we are seeing here in congress we dont have enough money we dont have enough money we dont have enough money to take care of the children we dont have enough money to take care of the firemen the police officers the first responders now we are even seeing those that went into the buildings to do cleanup are coming down with these lung ailments mount sinai hospital has been working with us here in congress when we first met with them years ago and by the way my background is as a nurse we thought we would have 10 15 years to take care of these problems we see these illnesses taking place we as americans can do better we should do better"], [0.4983196258544922,

the first time sacramento and san diego were not identified as highrisk areas while sacramento and san diego did receive fiscal year 2006 funding the new eligibility guidelines have put our funding for next year and beyond in jeopardy sacramento is the capital of the sixth largest economy in the world and home to dozens of critical federal and state governmental buildings much of the states water electricity and telecommunications systems are managed from sacramento of considerable concern is an attack on sacramentos dams and levees not only because of potential loss of life and impact to sacramentos families but an economic impact as well according to a sacramento bee analysis the economic impact of a major flood in sacramento would cost the region 35 billion this is damage to homes loss of jobs and government revenues the san diego area contains the nations seventh largest city adjacent to a heavily trafficked international border a busy port and tourist attractions nor should it be overlooked that a number of naval and marine bases are located in san diego including the largest naval base in the country with fewer installations after four rounds of brac an attack on even one could result in even greater impact an attack of either of these cities would have repercussions well beyond our region therefore congressman filner and i have very real concerns about dhss new eligibility guidelines accurately addressing our homeland security needs we all agree that a riskbased grant program is an effective use of our limited resources however policy is only as good as

chairman and i do believe he is a good friend knows that the senate is not the other body is not going to take this bill the way it is this is a joke ten million people are going to be denied the minimum wage with this bill this is a joke no one is going to take this on the other side so we do this in the midnight hour we have a headline we go home to campaign you will we will go home and tell the truth give us an up and down vote on a 7 25 minimum wage up or down vote the joke is on you this is an untruth and it makes no sense to put pebple who have been in the desert without getting any

might call it a rainy day in april the gentleman is so right it is the day that so many americans are filing their returns and are hoping to pay for the governance of this nation many americans in this time frame are facing some very difficult times i would liketo put before this body a challenge that i think is enormously important what do you say to americans who are filing their tax forms and who are facing 2 plus and growing price per gallon on gas this is an indistinguishable amount meaning you can be a multibillionaire or a person who is simply trying to make ends meet keeping the doors open paying the rent providing for four or five members of their family working in a blue collar or hourly job and in order to get to a job across town across county or into the next state we are asking americans to pay 2 plus per gallon for gas internationally gasoline is quite high the united states has always had the opportunity to experience a better quality of life this is a hardship on americans and as the committee of jurisdiction has marked up energy legislation i frankly believe it is not soon enough and it will not move soon enough i think it is important for the president of the united states to announce an energy relief policy that deals specifically with the high price of gas for those who are now suffering under that burden i do not want to leave industry out as i have traveled through the airports i am delighted to see that the numbers have gone up after 9 11 but frankly representing houstons intercontinental airport and the fourth largest city in the nation realizing the traveling public has many needs to travel by airplane the cost of jet fuel is killing our airline industry in fact my hometown airline their employees have taken an actual cut in salary so the airline can survive but as they have done that the jet fuel prices continue to go up and up and up ej 1700 any legislation that we pass next week or the following week will not address that crisis so i call upon the administration to acknowledge this as an economic crisis and establish some immediate relief whether or not it is going into those petroleum reserves on a temporary basis a 60day basis to bring some relief because there is going to be a point when those airlines that equate to a sizable proportion of our gnp are going to collapse under the burden of jet fuel cost and there will be a time when whole communities urban areas and rural areas will have a population of employees who on an hourly basis are working and cannot afford to get to work that is why i rise today to talk about and to add to the discussion what i think was an unfortunate legislative initiative that was passed today we all would hope to run away from bankruptcy that is not the direction that the american people desire to go i find the american people innovative hardworking desirous of a better quality of life desirous of giving their children a better quality of life and so i am offended by a bankruptcy bill that suggests that we represent a bunch of neerdowells and those who are running away from their legitimate debts that is what we did today frankly we passed a bankruptcy bill that puts in place a provision that clearly is not needed we have a bankruptcy code and a series of bankruptcy judges and each and every day they make a decision when a frivolous litigant comes through the door and looks in all the raging color this is certainly a person who is just simply trying to avoid paying their debts has the resources and that person if you will is dismissed or their case is not allowed to proceed in the bankruptcy court now in the backdrop of a number of corporate filings of bankruptcy my own constituent enron that filed bankruptcy and put 4 000 people out of work some of whom lost their lives because of the tragedy when we allow all of these major corporations to file bankruptcy now we are going to stand in the door of the courthouse and tell hardworking americans and middleclass americans if you dont pass a litmus test you get back out there and fall under the crunch and the concrete of your debts if you have a medical emergency if there is death in the family if you have lost your job or if you happen to be active duty reservists whose families have lost the income of that breadwinner who now are in iraq and afghanistan not for 6 months but for 1 year or 2 years and some who are forced to reenlist again because of the shortage of personnel these individuals now will have to pass a means test in order to be able to file bankruptcy because they are burdened by the responsibilities that they cannot pay we voted on a bankruptcy bill and we defeated the motion to recommit that would help these reservists it is a shame on us and a shame on this house mr president i beg of you not to sign this bankruptcy bill until we take care of the active duty reservists and national guard that is the least we can do for those who are offering their lives"]]}
