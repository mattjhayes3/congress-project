mean that if we are unable to resolve the fiscal cliff without raising taxes well already see a lot of new taxes as a result of the health care law on financial transactions on insurance programs on

what comes out of the committee so far out of these five appropriations bills theres been 691 billion spent and yet weve only cut 304 million in addition to that as i think about where we are i brought the analogy and trying to put this in context of where we are as a nation thats 2 cents just two pennies out of a gallon of gas just two pennies i leave you thatmy 2 cents worth on this

leonard boswell now weve been talking about how leonard is iowa through and through but leonard the secret is out you were born in missouri that was a great day for america but i think it has also been part of shaping the person you are because you know that we are much more than the state we come from the region we come from and everything about your life of public service has reflected that leonard grew up on farms in both ringgold and decatur counties and amazingly was drafted into the army on his 22nd birthday quite a birthday present he served with distinction for 20 years but the people who know him best can tell you that one of the things that made leonard boswell unique was he went from a draftee serving at the lowest levels of the army to being encouraged to go to officer candidate school what happens when you get commissioned you actually have to resign from the united states army in order to be commissioned leonard did that and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on february 19 1957 it seems like a long time ago after his commissioning as an officer youve heard how leonard served two tours as a helicopter assault pilot in vietnam leonard i know from doing a lot of interviews with vietnam veterans for the library of congresss oral history project that everyone remembers that first day when they arrived in vietnam and for you that was on april 12 1965 im sure that you can tell us the sights the sounds the smells the feelings you had when you arrived there one of the things that leonard never talks about because hes too modest of a person is the fact that he was awarded not one but two distinguished flying crosses for his bravery and heroism serving our country in vietnam on november 1 1968 on his second tour of duty leonard became the assault helicopter company commander for the 336 and led that unit with distinction until he finally retired and came back to the state that he loved and started pursuing other things but leonard has always been about service to country service to family and service to his faith so when an opportunity presented itself he ran for office in iowa he was elected to the iowa senate became senate president in iowa in 1992 and then continued his career here and weve heard the minority whip talk about how that all came about and were so glad that it did leonard has always been a strong advocate for military families he has a lot of proud achievements in this body but leonard your proudest moment was when the joshua omvig suicide prevention act was passed in the house passed in the senate and signed into law by the president and the reason why that was so meaningful to me personally is i knew joshua omvigs family long before he took his life and for you to take up that cause and to give voice to the thousands of americans who were losing loved ones to suicide who had served this country with honor and distinction was the cause you were meant to lead and to me that day when we passed the bill on the house floor was one of the highlights of my career in congress because one miraculous thing happened that day after you stood and talked about why we needed to do more for veterans like josh omvig to help them before they got to that point of taking their own lives an extraordinary thing happened after you spoke members on both sides of the aisle came down to the well and told the stories of constituents from their district who did the same thing that josh omvig did and put a human face on this crisis that was damaging our country that happened because of you leonard and i have never been prouder of you ive never been prouder of your leadership than the day that happened and america owes you a grateful thanks for leading the charge and giving voice to that problem but leonards courage and heroism just doesnt apply to his service to his country not long ago when an intruder attacked his home and his family leonard was there to stand up and protect them as well and you shrug it off leonard but everybody who knows you knows that the outcome of that horrible moment was inevitable that truth and justice were going to triumph because you were the one who was there at the right time and the right place we are honored to have the privilege of serving with you we wish you and dody and your entire family the best dont be a stranger were counting on you to continue to inspire us and

until this time that budget saves 41 billion below what the administration asked for last february the majority about 10 days ago passed a bill that said it wants to spend 100 billion less than what was proposed by the administration last february now logical people would say that we are very well on the way to a sensible compromise we are on track to save 41 billion below what was requested the majority wishes to spend 100 billion less than that i am certain that talented legislators like the chairman like mr dicks left to their own devices and leadership can find a way to have us strike a middle ground for the rest of the fiscal year i am hoping that this is the last one of these temporary extensions we have so that those who rely upon the continuing funding of government

on the part of the insurance companies and the other 15 percent is the administrative costs on the part of the providers the hospitals and doctors it is absolutely the most inefficient way to deliver

united states government should go into default i cant blame him for not being able to guarantee they will pass but let me say why taking my chances that they would pass even given his good faith

amendment dissects it takes the part of the amendment that he regards as less controversialand on his side of the aisleboth parts will be controversial but the least controversial partand he says i take this part its exactly like the homeless part of the socalled norton amendment but the other part that i testified to in rules committee he is not identified with that amendment on this floor now i ask members what would you think if the chairman had gone with you to rules saying he supported the amendment and then when we got to the floor was willing to stand upsorrywent to the trouble of pulling out one section of my amendment only to claim as his own why wouldnt he simply embrace my amendment worse why wouldnt he have made sure that this was a bipartisan bill so that i would not be put in this position and this is important to understand if i bring up my amendment separately and it goes down what will be before the house is essentially the bill i voted against in the transportation and infrastructure committee do i look like a fool i voted against the bill that is on the floor today in all good faith the chairman cannot guarantee that the full bill with the changes that he and i agreed to will be the bill that in fact emerges here this evening in fact let me be even more blunt what is more likely to emerge here this evening is the original bill that i in fact opposed on the transportation and infrastructure committee the only way to make sure that my major objection which was to nepa is included in the bill would have been for this bill to come forward with what i agreed to in the bill already for me to have to come to the floor to beg that a part of this bill which was central to my agreement to support it now get a vote especially from a side of this chamber which has consistently voted against sections like the section that is at issue here is to defyis not to understand how to put together a compromise if you have a compromise and you come to the floor you dont take out part of what the compromise was about leaving the other part so that she can fend herself on the floor knowing full well that the chances of getting that part of the amendment passed are based on past experience are not very great so the reason i oppose it is because i believe that perhaps and i dont know if other amendments on the democratic side would be accepted or not but i believe that as it now stands the bill will look essentially like the bill that i spent all year opposing because my major reasons for opposing it have not been incorporated in the bill that will be the final bill voted on and if i were to depend only on an amendment on this floor to get this provision which has always been controversial on their side in the bill then i dont think theres anybody on that side would guarantee that on their side my amendment with the nepa provision would in fact pass in that event what i would be left with is the very bill that i have voted against for an entire year and that is why i object to the way in which this bill has been handled i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
