armenian genocide 100 years ago 1 5 million armenians along with the syrians and greeks were slaughtered by the ottoman empire in the first genocide of the 20th century the sheer scale of genocide thwarts our capacity to comprehend it 1 5 million armenians killed 6 million jews killed in the holocaust 1 million tutsis the numbers become abstractions sanitized by their enormity it is only when we consider each of those lives individually that the full horror comes into focus the victims of genocide are more than victimsthey are human beings the armenians massacred from 1915 to 1923 were men women and children who were targeted in what was then an unprecedented campaign to wipe out an entire people it is our duty in the modern day to remember those lost and to bear witness that the campaign to destroy the armenian people failed we do so by speaking the truth and we do so by speaking the names of those 1 5 million and by keeping both the way they lived and the way they died alive in our memory earlier this month i asked my thousands of armenian constituents and millions of armenians around the country and the world to submit the names and stories of their family members who were killed 100 years ago the response was overwhelming thousands of people sent the names and stories of ancestors killed in the genocidethe names of infants and toddlers ripped from their mothers arms the names of children and the elderly dying of exhaustion and starvation on a forced march to deir ezzor the names of women and girls raped and brutalized and killed the names of clergy tortured and burned alive in their own churches the names of men robbed of their possessions of their homes and of their lives each victim has a name and a story from glendale to yerevan to jordan and every corner of the world where armenian diaspora lives families sent me those names and those stories it is my honor to read some of those names this hour knowing that it would take more than 1 000 hours more than 50 days to read all of them turkey may deny the genocide our administration may lack the courage to recognize the genocide our congress may lack the courage to recognize the genocide but no one can deny the humanity of its victims and no one can deny our right to speak the truth one hundred years ago 1 5 million armenians were killed in the armenian genocide these are their names george

will be paid but teachers cops and nurses wont i want to continue today and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente y el comisionado residente no puede ver esta crisis como una herramienta en sus campanias para un puesto mis alto el congreso s6lo ayudari a puerto rico siempre y cuando haya un llamado constante y persistente de los puertorriquehos exigiendo que el congreso cumpla y los puertorriquehlos tienen que indicar lo que esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el pueblo debe decirle a wall street que puerto rico no es una tienda para ser pirateada y que el pueblo de puerto rico no esperari a morir de hambre mientras wall street cuenta sus ganancias si wall street esti comprando bonos con descuentos deben ser pagados con descuentos pero sobre todo tenemos que trabajar juntos por el bien de puerto rico y no podemos dejar que las divisiones politicas sobre la estadidad nos dividan me comprometo como siempre lo he hecho a poner a un lado mis propios sentimientos sobre el estatus de puerto rico y a trabajar con otros puertorriquefios en el congreso y otros lideres en los dos partidos que est6n dispuestos a ayudarnos pero primero tenemos que

columbias reproductive health nondiscrimination amendment act of 2014 or rhnda the declaration of independence declares that we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness these founding principles remain true today the reason life was included by our founders as the first principle is because without life there is no liberty it is a prerequisite for liberty without life there is no pursuit of happiness in fact it is selfevident without life there isnt even a discussion about any rights liberty encompasses social and political freedoms and the tenets associated with liberty were those used in drafting the first amendment to the constitution with life and liberty you can pursue happiness take away either and the pursuit becomes difficult or impossible my amendment protects all three but i will focus my comments on liberty as it relates to the free exercise of religion clause in the first amendment the first amendment states in part that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof without my amendment some employers in the district of columbia would not only be prohibited from exercising their religion but would be forced to embrace the beliefs of the 13 members of the d c council the district of columbia allows abortions until the moment of birth but a number of employers in the district of columbia believe in the sanctity of life and protecting it in fact many organizations in d c such as march for life americans united for life and the national right to life committeeexist solely to protect life the constitution provides them the right to exercise those beliefs just like it does those who oppose it that is why when the district of columbia passed the reproductive health nondiscrimination amendment act of 2014 former mayor vincent gray expressed concerns about the law in december 2014 gray wrote a letter to the d c council about rhnda describing it as legally problematic and saying the bill raises serious concerns under the constitution and under the religious freedom restoration act of 1993 religious organizations religiously affiliated organizations religiously driven forprofit entities and political organizations may have strong first amendment and rfra grounds for challenging the laws applicability to them employers who oppose abortions and paying for them as part of a compensation package have every right to exercise their freedom not to do so and those who want to receive abortions or have them paid for have every right to seek employment from someone willing to do so that is how freedom works it does not work with one group imposing its version of freedom on the other which is what this district law currently provides for in its 2012 opinion in the case of hosanna tabor v eeoc the supreme court unanimously affirmed the right of religious organizations to hire employees that support the mission of the organization where their employees are responsible for carrying out its mission the opinion says the interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statuses is undoubtedly important but so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs teach their faith and carry out their mission would you require peta to hire someone that comes to an interview in a fur coat would you require planned parenthood to hire a nun or anyone adamantly opposed to abortion neither of these situations makes sense nor does requiring a prolife organization to hire someone who explicitly contradicts their moral conscience or religious beliefs the supreme court agrees my amendment would restore religious freedom to employers inside the district of columbia those who want to have abortions do not have to work for employers who oppose them they have life

response to my good friend from massachusetts concerns remember the provisions in the tax legislation that we are considering have been routinely enacted for years under both democratic and republican congresses and democratic and republican administrations they are so automatic that they are essentially part of the existing tax code frankly i predict once we get to the legislation probably we will have dozens of my friends colleagues vote in favor of these that certainly was the case last year when similar provisions were brought to the floor there will be a lot of democratic votes for the very bills that are under consideration i agree with my friend we do need a larger overhaul of the entire tax system he is totally correct at that we made some progress in that regard last year i have no doubt that is exactly mr ryans intent the reason to act on these measures and others like them now that will be part of any final package is to simply give our fellow americansbusinesses workers and people that want to make charitable contributionstax certainty early in the year so they can go ahead and make their actions knowing that this legislation is in place i am not convinced that none of these will be taken up by the other side in the other chamber we will see it is an unpredictable body but we will see i want to compliment my friend from new york the gentlewoman who is the ranking member on appropriations we have gotten 95 percent or so of government funded in large part due to her efforts in conjunction with our colleague the chairman of the appropriations committee and she was a big reason that that got done and got done in a bipartisan manner we passed legislation across this floor with the gentleladys help quite frankly so all of us myself included owe you a debt in that regard i do point out that the legislation on homelandwe have acted on that now my friends have said well perhaps you should sue the president that is a good suggestion about 30odd states are doing that right now he is in court because the action he took in their view is going to cost them millions and millions of dollars my personal view is perhaps the house should somehow associate itself with that lawsuit that is not my decision to make but i think that is an appropriate thing to do this was an action that was extraordinarily provocative by the president the president has a long history of using immigration as a political issue rather than viewing it as a problem to be solved when he ran for office in 2008 he said he would have an immigration bill on the floor within 100 days we had a democratic senate and a democratic house and we never saw the bill then we didnt hear much about it for 2 years because he was busy running for his own reelection then later we heard a lot about it the president said he was going to act before the election then he pulled back from doing that because he thought well electorally this may not be advantageous but the minute afterwards when he thought it was to his political advantage he rolled it out again so lets be real here about how serious this effort is but it will be challenged in court in terms of this body again it has passed appropriate legislation on funding it has done exactly as my friend from new york suggests use some of the tools that are legitimately at its disposal that bill now rests in the senate if the democratic minority in the senate will allow it to be brought up i would not expect it would come back exactly as this house fashioned it they simply just need to do their job send something back go to conference and we can act on it they have had lots of time to do this this was moved over there weeks agoor a couple of weeks ago the real problem here is the united states senate because of the obstruction of the minority is simply choosing not to act as soon as they act i think we will probably move pretty expeditiously find some common ground and address my friends concerns because i think they are very legitimate concerns and very appropriate in terms of getting the homeland security bill done it is a good bill the underlying bill that my friend was part of negotiating was an excellent piece of bipartisan bicameral compromise if the senate would simply take up the bill in front of them i think we could get to the point we could have an agreement in rather short order i will continue

in the drama of republican control of congress this is their first opportunity with complete control of both chambers to bring into focus what they would do governing and the results arent pretty we are discussing this week a budget that has been labeled by press accounts that actually give them the benefit of the doubt as being phony or a disaster it has been condemned by many conservative commentators as a sham the purported 5 5 trillion in budget savings over the next 10 years provides no good explanation about how it can actually be achieved there is a trillion dollars in unspecified reductions other mandatory programs they would abolish the affordable care act but somehow keep all of the revenues that finance it there are a few areas of clarity which are hardly comforting the ratcheting down support for our lowincome college students through pell grants is hardly a step forward and will be widely condemned the more clearly people understand it we are back to the medicare voucher which may have a different name but is still toxic a measure of their understanding of its unpopularity is their refusal to put it into effect for seniors now instead they would have people approaching retirement age in their midfifties who will be able to enjoy the benefits and uncertainty of a vouchered medicare program it is silent on the transportation crisis that is already upon us the latest transportation extension expires may 31 resources are not going to be available to get us through this fiscal year let alone the next fiscal year that they would budget for and if the budget that they have foreseen would somehow be enacted as written the next fiscal year would see massive cuts for every single state across the country for transportation it continues to chip away at the ability of the federal government to hire and maintain the skilled workforce americans depend upon one of the most bizarre examples is their continued attack on the ability of the irs the internal revenue service to perform the functions necessary to finance our government what business cripples its accounts receivable department and the proof of this approach is available to any american who tries to call the irs to get information it is almost impossible to get through now let alone with the budget cuts that are anticipated you can ask any cpa in your district about the devastating effects of crippling the irs on not just the average citizen but even on people who can hire the best legal and accounting services available while the irs may be an attractive target for their assault on government the attack is not limited to the internal revenue or the epa this budget will have crippling effects on the american way of life all across the country this budgetary approach that is already baked in produces fewer people to be able to deal with the services for the exploding number of retired people seeking help from the social security administration it shortchanges the maintenance of our national parks it underfunds medical research that can make a huge difference for american families there are things that could be done i introduced legislation this week the reinin
