done at the subcommittee level where people take seriously the business of listening to the pros and cons of very special programs and making judgments about spending levels that are a reflection

needed they claim that without this procedure the health and even the lives of mothers in this country will be at risk by saying this they seem to suggest that those of us who want to ban this procedure are somehow being insensitive or cruel but former surgeon general c everett koop says the procedure is never medically necessary to protect a mothers life or her future fertility on the contrary he says this procedure can pose a significant threat to both the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists says there are no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life of a mother and to preserve the health of a woman in 1995 a panel of 12 doctors representing the american medical association voted unanimously to recommend banning partialbirth abortion the american medical association the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists and the most respected doctor in america are all telling the truth but not everyone is not too long ago ron fitzsimmons executive director of the national coalition of abortion providers admitted that he lied through his teeth when he claimed that partialbirth abortions are rare and only on women whose lives are in danger or whose babies had severe defects he also admitted that he had lied about how frequent partialbirth abortions are there are thousands every year in america what mr fitzsimmons showed us is that there are proabortion activists in this country so extreme in their position so completely unwilling to listen to reason that they will defend even this procedure which is indistinguishable from coldblooded infanticide stabbing a baby in the back of the neck with scissors is gruesome even if his head remains an inch inside the birth canal partialbirth abortion is so gruesome and so barbaric that it must be stopped immediately it is completely unnecessary it is in every case unjustifiable and in no case the lesser of two evils the will of the american people has been consistently clear in every poll on this issue the house and senate have both passed this ban before by large margins clearly reasonable and thinking americans want this ban to become law a few extremists continue to stand in the way we will be asked to recommit this bill so that they can add on a provision providing an exemption for what they call mental health that will of course mean there is no ban at all in fact if they are having a bad day they can have a partialbirth abortion we have a good bill before us it does not need to be changed it already does what we know is the right thing to do we should stop playing games and pass this good legislation so that america can go back to believing that their government stands for decency america knows that partialbirth abortion is

may consume i rise in opposition to this bill republicans on the committee on education and the workforce have decided to take a giant step backward in providing for the most disadvantaged public schools and their pupils just 5 hours ago this body passed h r 2 a bill to target federal funds to poor disadvantaged children that bill was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support now if we enact h r 2300 tonight it would eviscerate the enhanced targeting and accountability provisions contained in that bipartisan bill despite the majoritys claim to the contrary their highsounding academic achievement for all act does nothing to ensure that federal funds will help children improve their scholastic abilities it does nothing to support practices which are proven to raise student achievement the bill essentially gives states billions of dollars in the form of revenue sharing without accountability for local educational providers or for protection to our most disadvantaged students this bill permits states to use federal funds to support private school vouchers and ignores federal priorities for class size reduction for teacher quality and for professional development it creates a massive yes a permissive block grant where governors conceivably can spend federal dollars on virtually anything from swimming pools band uniforms to private school vouchers even though this bill is designed to please the governors at the expense of local school districts the national governors association has sharply criticized this bills abandonment of poor children in an october 8 letter to congress the governors wrote and i quote we governors recognize the link between the concentration of poverty and low educational achievement in schools with the highest proportion of disadvantaged children students are less likely to achieve at higher levels we would suggest that the federal government continue to concentrate federal funds on these schools such support is essential given that the nation is truly committed to the belief that all students can achieve at higher levels only with a change to continue the targeting of title i funds would the national governors association beable to bring bipartisan support to the legislation end of the quote from the national governors association we need legislation that will help communities by raising academic performance through smaller class sizes by holding schools accountable for achieving high academic standards and by helping every school become safe and disciplined and we need to replace dilapidated

their parents i served in the pennsylvania legislature when we passed the parental consent law there are about 20 states that have parental involvement laws some parental notice some parental consent in pennsylvania we require consent of one of the two parents and in case there is a breakdown between the parents and the child we have a judicial bypass where the child can go before in a confidential setting a judge to get a decision this law was designed because of a case that happened in pennsylvania in 1995 where a 12yearold young girl was impregnated by an 18yearold male and then the mother of that male took that 12yearold girl to a neighboring state new york without her parents knowledge or consent for a secret abortion now my colleagues this is outrageous where in america a stranger can take a minor child whose parents who know the medical history know the psychological makeup of their child without their knowledge or consent there was a study in california of 46 500 teenage schoolage moms guess what they found twothirds of them were impregnated by adult males the median age was 22 years old in many cases it is these males who are takingthe young girls across

that live in california this is 21 hours back and forth to california and then to return the following day so i decided to stay here and send messages to my veterans organizations and also to do a special order since that time we found out that there will not be votes tomorrow that they will not happen until tuesday the men and the women behind me and before me have come today to pay homage to our veterans i apologize for keeping them here on veterans day but i will be brief today is very difficult for many of us both memorial day and veterans day that as a retired navy person i was shot down on my 300th mission over north vietnam i understand and appreciate what this day means to veterans and what it means for their families for the active duty the reserve and the guard and for our prisoners of war wherever they may be this is our last meeting for veterans day of this century for we enter the 21st century in this next year like the human search for freedom this century our peace has come at a very high price throughout this cen tury for those of us that have seen combat andits horrors resist as a last means engaging into another war many have fought for different reasons in different conflicts but i can think of no other reason other than freedom that should rise to the top of reasons for conflict i would like to think as we enter this next century that the world would be free not only free for individuals but free of conflict but unfortunately it is still a very serious and dangerous place i feel serving on the defense committee on appropriations that it is even more dangerous than it was 25 years or even 50 years ago i would like to go through a couple of stories i think in honor of some veterans i heard this first story from ronald reagan as he accepted his inauguration on the capitol steps a few years back i would ask my colleagues if they have ever heard of a private named martin trepto a very famous individual i would say that no one listening to this speech or yourself mr speaker would know who he is but let me tell my colleagues his story martin trepto was a baker that made bread and rolls in france and during world war i he closed his shop and he volunteered to go to war because he thought it was his duty as martin trepto entered the battlefield he was assigned a position as a messenger they did not have the fancy electronics that they have today and many of those messages were carried in a couriers pouch when martin trepto got to the battlefield the three messengers ahead of him had been killed trying to deliver a message martin trepto volunteered to take that message forward to the front lines and like the other three messengers martin trepto was killed they found his diary and in his diary it read this has been a very difficult war i do not know if i will survive it no ti ce effective january 1 2000 the subscription price of the congressional record will be 357 per year or 179 for 6 months individual issues may be purchased for 3 00 per copy the cost for the microfiche edition will remain 141 per year single copies will remain 1 50 per issue this price increase is necessary based upon the cost of printing and distribution michael f dimario public printer but i must treat every action of mine as if that individual action would shorten this war and cause freedom for my friends how profound is that how many of us honor those veterans that gave their lives in some cases that served this country so that if every one of their actions would give us the right to stand here the day that i was shot down over vietnam the executive officer of the f92 commander blackburn was also shot down he did not come back his backseater steve hoodloff came back with the rest of the pows in 1994 commander blackburns son lived in poway california in my congressional district and from time to time his son would call and say duke can i come over and talk about my father it was the same questions and mostly the same answers well a few years later about 8 years they brought commander blackburns remains back now it is not like his son wanted to see his father come back but it was like a 5 000pound weight had been lifted off that childs back knowing the reserve and the resolve of what happened to his father that is why that if there is any hope of any pow or mia coming back that we must turn over every stone and do everything that we can possible recently i visited north vietnam it was very difficult pete peterson who is a democrat now the ambassador to vietnam asked me to come and raise the american flag over ho chi minh city for the first time that was also very difficult to do but i want to tell you that the men and the women of our active duty military and some of our veterans are doing everything that they can at least in vietnam to make sure that our loved ones know the resolve of their family members that did not come back from that war let me tell you about another individual on 19 january 1972 i was fortunate enough to survive and shoot down a mig21 over north vietnam one of five that i shot down when i got back aboard the unitedstatess constellation all 5 000 guys were up on the flight deck we were trying to get the wings folded my backseater willie driscoll and i get the arm switches safe i looked over at the side of the aircraft and there were the 5 000 guys with captain james d ward who was skipper of the unitedstatess connie admiral hutch cooper was commander of task force 77 and there was my plane captain willie lincoln white with a big smile on his face he broke through the crowd mr speaker he knocked over admiral cooper and you do not do that in the navy as he broke through the crowd he ran back under the tail feathers of the airplane and jumped up on the port wing and he came down the turtle back as i am trying to get the ejection seat pinned into the airplane and he grabbed me by the arm and he said lieutenant cunningham lieutenant cunningham we got our mig today didnt we what was willie white telling me mr speaker that he was a very important member of a team that he was a united states serviceman that i only deserved about onefivethousandth of the credit from ramirez the filipino cook that used to fix our double egg double cheese double fry burger every night to the guys that put the hydraulic pumps in the airplane to the fuel if you can imagine an ordnance man forgetting to put an umbilical cord on a missile or a gun so that it did not work they all deserve credit that is who we honor today those veterans who served this country i saw plane captains cry when their pilots did not come back that is how intense and how dedicated they were let me talk of another hero a veteran he has asked me not to tell his name and he is alive today if i can get through this i have a good friend that was a prisoner in vietnam and it took him almost 5 years to knit an american flag on the inside of his shirt as a prisoner of war in hanoi and on occasion he would take off his shirt whenever they got together with one or two prisoners and they would hang the shirt with the flag above them to symbolize freedom and that was fine until the vietnamese guards broke in one day and they ripped his shirt to shreds they took out this prisoner and they brutally beat him all day long when they brought him back he was unconscious he had broken bones so bad that his fellow prisoners did not think he would survive and so they took him and put him on a bale of straw and comforted him as much as they could and went back and huddled in a corner a few minutes later they heard a stirring from the pow he had dragged himself to the center of the floor and started gathering those bits of thread to knit another american flag that is what veterans day is it stands for freedom it stands for the constitution of this great country i would look at the conflicts that we have had over the last 5 years and i think foreign policy with military policy in many cases has been wrong in my opinion our military today is at the lowest that i have ever seen it in 30 years of military service we are keeping only about 23 percent of our military our enlisted in we are retaining only about 30 percent of our pilots many will say well it is just the economy because they are going out for the jobs and away from the military that is partially true but the primary reason is when i talk to these young men and women that are serving on active duty they are away from their families from their wives and from their children in some cases husband and children for 8 months out of the year and in some cases this has been 4 years in a row this is during peacetime that is hard for anybody to be away from their family at 8 months at a time each year in somalia we lost 22 rangers because the white house refused to give them armor it took us 17 hours to get into mogadishu by the time we got there we had lost 22 rangers this was the third time that our military leaders had asked for armor yet in somalia the warlords are still there general aideed has died but his son is still there and it cost us billions of dollars in haiti we are still spending 20 million a year in haiti the warlords are still there aristide is still there and that cost us billions of dollars iraq we went in four times over the last 2 years each time that mr ritter and them were rejected from inspection we went to war it has cost us billions of dollars and today we are spending a billion dollars not a million dollars but a billion dollars a year still in iraq bosnia has cost this country 16 billion that does not account for next year or the following years we bombed an aspirin factory in sudan the white house just settled for 50 million because of a mistake in kosovo the total number of people killed in kosovo before us the united states and nato going into kosovo was 1 012 onethird of those were serbs that were killed by the kla we destroyed an infrastructure of an entire country we lost thousands of people thousands of people were thrust out of their homes and today look at the results ninety percent of the serbs have been ethnically cleansed out of kosovo by the kla one hundred eighty orthodox catholic churches have been destroyed by the kla and we are building two 350 million bases in kosovo the united states are we going to be there like we are in south korea or other places in the world and whether you agree with kosovo or not we flew 86 percent of all the missions in kosovo the united states 86 percent ninety percent of all the weapons dropped were from the united states and if we are to ask our active duty our reserve and our 5uard to fly in these conflicts and other nations not pay their fair share then at least nato needs to upgrade its equipment so that they can use the standoff weapons or they need to pay for it because before this congress today the great debate on are we spending social security and medicare money or not 150 billion in these conflicts in my opinion there are very few that the united states should have entered in i think it is time as j c watts said in the republican convention in san diego we ask god to come back into our country i think it is time to secure peace through strength i would ask mr president not through weakness not through bracs not through decreasing our defense budget but increasing it recently the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff every one of our fourstar generals said we need 150 billion to bring us up to where we can fight just two wars i do not want our men and women going to war and having to celebrate or recognize them during memorial day because we did not give them the assets it is time to honor our veterans our active duty our reserves and give them the resources that we promised and to our veterans as well because as we honor our veterans today many of the fellows that i served with the men and women are telling their children not to enter active duty service because their benefits have been eroded well this congress in a very bipartisan way with the veterans bill and with the defense bill came to that call we provided 1 7 billion increase for veterans medical health care the largest increase since the 1980s the total funding is 19 billion for our veterans it provides a 5 million increase for veterans medical and prosthetic research it provides 51 million for the veterans benefit administration to expedite claims processing many of my veterans and the veterans of every member in this body have got veterans saying that those claims take too long we more than doubled the presidents request for veterans state extended care my veterans in san diego county wrote a bill called subvention it enables our veterans to use medicare at military hospitals it actually saves money but yet we are still limited to a pilot project our veterans are saying they are tired of bandaids for their promised health care we need to pass the fehbp for veterans if you have an active duty military and you have a civilian that sits next to them when they retire the civilian gets fehbp which is a supplemental to medicare the military does not that is wrong we could help our veterans by passing that as a full substitute and to help them do that as well let me close with what i think this day represents on the 10th of may 1972 i was shot down over vietnam in coming down in a parachute i thought i ws going to be a prisoner of war or even killed since the enemy was down below air force marine and navy pilots risked their lives to get my backseater and i out in coming down in that parachute they told us there were two things that would keep you alive one was having a good family back home and the other was faith in god i would tell my veterans there is going to be a time in each and every one of your lives maybe you lose a loved one maybe you lose your job but if you get on your knees and you say a little prayer i guarantee somebody is going to listen to you it is time to invite god back into this country i think as we look forward into the 21st century how exciting it is not just communications but health care research and the things that we can do to take care of our veterans i would close by saying god bless the veterans god bless the active the guard and the reserves and to our mias and our families do not give up hope god bless america"], [1.1941846196350525e-06, 1.1941846196350525e-06, 0, "i thank the gentle woman for yielding me this time this issue of tobacco which i suspect will dominate the debate

this package we bring before my colleagues in the rule and will eventually vote on it when we vote on the amendment is the fact that we put a trigger in here that is going to protect the fact that we pay down debt or we do not do the tax cut that is a very simple premise this is a responsible premise there should not be anybody in here opposed to that especially as to the fact that the government is now operating at a surplus and we have now designed a mechanism in here to do that that is the kind of policy that makes good politics and it is good for america we are going to talk about the kinds of tax cuts we have and how much of the tax cuts and which ones they are and all that but we have protected the ability to keep getting the tax cuts as long as we are responsible with paying down the debt that this nation has incurred so that we can again fight a cold war that took all of these trillions of dollars to win it we may never have to do that again but if we are not prepared to and have the ability as a government to go back up that course we would never have it again i urge my colleagues to vote yes"], [0.49875648121815175, 0.0012435187818482518, 0, "tonight we are through with legislative business for the week it has been a very energetic week for the house of representatives we have discussed and debated a lot of issues as we see just a few minutes ago the charade continues about the discussion and the debate about where this country is on social security what i would like to do is for the next hour or so to take some time to explain to the american public what the truth is about social security where we are what this congress is doing because i believe that there is a more responsible answer that we should give to the american public we should not scare the american public but most of all that the truth should not be held hostage we should not have to hear politician after politician come and to spout out what i think are their wishes for doom and gloom of this social security system when in fact a lot of focus has been placed upon it and the american public have written their congressmen and members of congress have gotten engaged in this issue and so i would like to use this remaining time of this hour to talk directly with the american public to provide them information not only about how social security is doing but the difference between the gross and the net the gross being the top side that they hear about and the net being the bottom i am joined tonight by several of my republican colleagues who are going to engage in this debate with me it has been a marvelous week here in washington we believe we are at the point now where we can look the american public right in the eye and tell them the truth about where we are in washington whether we are going to spend social security that we are going to balance the budget and that we can make a deal because responsible people in washington d c can make responsible decisions tonight i

about a sunset today we should be talking about a sunrise a sunrise for tax reform i am very disappointed that we do not have legislation on the floor that would talk about tax reform because we do need tax reform what this legislation represents is a failure a failure by this body to take up tax reform a signal that we will not deal with it in this congress the third consecutive congress under the control of the republicans in which they have not brought tax reform to the floor of this house if my colleagues are looking for agreement on both sides of the aisle we agree that the current income tax code is too complicated so what do we do about it during these past 3 terms add another 100 sections and make it more complicated make it more difficult for our constituents to understand how to file their tax returns that is not tax reform those actions became law if my colleagues want agreement on both sides of the aisle that we should have less income taxes they will get that agreement let us bring forward bills that do it i strongly support the expansion of the earned income tax credit that has helped many taxpayers get the relief that they need but we sometimes find that on the other side of the aisle they fight us on that type of legislation or targeted relief that would let less people need to file income tax returns in our country but no they do not seem to want to do it that way so why not work together on tax reform so that we can really get something done in this congress rather than having a tool that is just basically used for the 30second commercial that does not befit this body and the tragedy is that if this legislation were to become law what would be the consequences the first thing is we would not know what the tax revenue system of this country would be what advice would my colleagues give to their constituents their young married couple who wants to purchase a home but needs to know the tax consequences of that home purchase in order to make sure that their budget makes sense to buy that home what will they tell them when there is no tax code in place and we have not quite figured out what the revenue code will be for our country the uncertainty will be very damaging to american families that is not what we should be doing and then what tax code will we put into effect i know there has been a lot of debate about this quite frankly i have a good tax plan that i would like to be able to talk about and if we bring a bill to the floor i will certainly be offering an alternative or amendments to that tax bill but the reason why we use the retail sales tax is because that is the one i think our constituents understand the best to allow us some ability to compare between one tax code and the other if we translate what the repeal of all income taxes is on a retail sales tax that is 59 5 percent added to the price of all goods all services that is not my estimate that is the joint tax committees estimate i do not want to be responsible for increasing prescription drugs and increasing internet service and increasing clothing and increasing food by that type of price that is not good for our economy let us think about what we are doing let us work together let us work on tax reform and not on a bill that will have no impact on real tax reform"], [0.49898528563790023, 0.0010147143620997667, 0, "i move to strike the requisite number of words i am not going to take all 5 minutes i just want to rise in support of the work my good friend the gentleman from indiana has done and others have spoken to and want to say how pleased i am to offer this amendment i also want to mention the fact as others have and will that i am a firm believer that just throwing more money at many problems does not solve them i know the background of the gentleman from pennsylvania chairman goodling is in education i happened to have been a middle school teacher for 10 years before i came to work here in the congress and know that there are some problems we will never fix no matter how much money we throw at them or throw toward them or with them this is one though that works this is one where i think we are appreciative of the work that the chairman and the ranking member of the full committee and the chairman and the ranking member also of the subcommittee we appreciate that increase of 7 7 up to 8 3 we are suggesting another modest increase that will not solve all the problems will not be a panacea and there will still be some problems but i want to point out that there are some problems in this country in some schools where when and if we can get some additional funding it will make a difference i am convinced that this is one of those areas where that will work i am convinced that when we approach this in a bipartisan way we will have success we are willing to work with the committee and the appropriators to make sure that that kind of money is made available i urge all of my colleagues to support the

ranking member of an authorizing committee informed the leadership that they would have an objection to a unanimous consent request and subsequently had that ignored and indeed had a unanimous consent request made in their absence in effect snuck past them without giving them an opportunity to exercise their rights i believe this is disgraceful i am stunned i cannot believe when i walked on this floor to learn that after we had clearly communicated to the leadership that we would have a unanimous consent objection that we were not informed and given the right to be here to protect our rights but if that is the way the republican leadership wants to run this house then that is their decision it is certainly not my decision and i cannot find the words to adequately express my dismay at the way this house is being managed now having said that i want to emphasize that i have absolutely no quarrel whatsoever with the gentleman from california the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee indeed he did his work as his legislation passed through this house indeed i voted for his appropriation bill when it passed through this house and in spite of some of the things that we do not like about it i assumed that i would be prepared to vote for it for the conference report when it came back but there is one little problem that is we have not seen the conference report we have not been able to read the conference report it might be an excellent conference report and it might be one which we can support we simply do not know that because we have not had the opportunity to see it and to study it and to read it this problem takes on particular significance because of the experience we have had in the past in dealing with matters such as this let me remind the house that when the omnibus bill came through here last year not only did we not have a chance to see it but we accepted it on faith and indeed we only discovered later that a point of order which was part of the law in t21 the transportation bill had been changed without our knowledge in the last moments before that omnibus bill came to the floor and we never knew it was in there that is not the end of the story indeed as previous legislation came to the floor with regard to the aviation bill the house in the aviation bill last year provided that a 30 percent funding of the total funding would come from the general fund the senate in the bilt as it worked its way through the senate provided that 30 percent of the total funding would come from the general fund we were assured that that is what obviously would come back to the house in a conference report since that is what both the house bill said and what the senate bill said but in the dead of night despite those assurances we received the general fund percentage was cut to 15 percent nobody knew it we did not know it not only did we not know it we were lied to we were lied to and i choose that word carefully because we were assured that it would be 30 percent funded so with that kind of a background with that kind of experience in the past how can we in good conscience take the assurance that this bill which i indeed voted for when it came through the house that this bill is as it is purported to be there is an old saying fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me well i suppose fool me thrice and it really would make a fool of us all so i regret i regret that our right was not protected to object to the unanimous consent request i regret that we have not had an opportunity to see this conference report which once we study it may well be acceptable i regret that we were misled last year in the omnibus bill i regret that we were misled yes lied to with regard to the aviation general funding in last years bill so for all of those reasons i must oppose this conference report express my deep regret and urge all my colleagues who care about following the proper procedure of this house and knowing what is in legislation urge them all to oppose this conference report i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.49911821354180574, 0.0008817864581942558, 0, "this obviously is quite an emotional issue when people talk about patients rights all of us want to protect patients rights i can understand how the gentleman from texas and other speakers on the other side would say this is a partisan issue because we can make it quite a partisan issue but the point that i would like to make is that politics is the art of compromise as the gentleman from arizona said many on that side of the aisle have taken the position it is either our way or it is no way they also would make the argument that government can best solve this problem yes i think government has a part and an important part in trying to solve this problem but i would also remind everyone that this patient protection bill we get the impression that it would affect every patient in america that is really not true it affects only those covered under erisa plans health plans provided by certain employers those employers have a vested interest in helping their employees with good health care that is why they have initiated many of these plans the reason that we want some flexibility for these conferees on the house side is that what the senate passed is drastically different than what the house passed it would be unwise it could not work if our conferees cannot have any flexibility whatsoever so if the other side really wants to try to solve this problem and have a meaningful bill that can protect patients under erisa plans then we need to defeat this motion they can go to conference they can have disagreements we can come back and vote on it again but to tie their hands before they even get there i think is not

from the one the gentleman has been on and that is we achieve these budget surpluses with real budget discipline among other things we impose cost curbs and controls discretionary spending ceilings for example that have held spending down for the last 10 years as a consequence we have reduced spending in the federal budget to where today it is about 19 percent of the total economy in other words out of every dollar this economy produces the government takes a bite of about 19 cents as recently as the mid1980s in the peak pinnacle of the reagan years we were spending the federal government as a percentage of gdp 23 6 percent as opposed to 19 percent going to 18 percent in a few years under the budget we have now in place 3 to 4 percentage points less than we were spending just 15 years ago now why is that significant for social security in order to pay for the longrun cost of social security once the ratio of those working to those retired drops to about 2 2 to 1 we will need to shift resources out of our gdp into the social security program because we have lowered spending we will need to shift about 2 7 percent maximum of our total economy in order to fund the peak demands of the social security system after the babyboomers fully retire because we have adjusted spending we have laid the basis the foundation for making that adjustment in the future another way that we position ourselves to finally stand up to this problem address the problem rise to the opportunity and it will be a shame if we blow this opportunity and do something else before we have saved and made social
