federal treasury then the money would keep on flowing year after year after year the bill that is before the committee this afternoon attempts to restrict this automatic refunding provision but does not do so in an effective manner this amendment insures the discontinuance of the preference that existing grantees have over other legal delivery systems by completely repealing the automatic refunding provision the present act provides existing grantees with an automatic pipeline to the federal treasury when their grants expire section 4 b 2 of the bill grandfathers for the 1982 calendar year the supposedly repealed presumptive funding provision section 4 b 2 and a provision which retains some of the procedural requirements on termination and suspension of funding provide unnecessary roadblocks by making it too difficult for the legal services corporation to withdraw funding from a present grant recipient who does not comply with the grant contract the retention of the presumptive funding language makes it difficult to discipline or replace existing grantees my amendment strikes the grandfather section from the bill and removes the cumbersome procedural requirements for termination or suspension of funding this amendment puts the corporation and its grantees in the same relationship as grantees have with other federal agencies mainly the decision of funding or refunding rests entirely with the agency and no presumption favoring the grant applicant this legislation reduces the total authorization for the legal services corporation from the present 321 million a year to 260 million a year the conference committee report on the budget resolution provided 100 million for fiscal year 1982 for the legal services corporation the fact of the matter remains that there is going to be a substantial reduction in funding legislated by this congress for legal services irrespective of what framework the legal services reauthorization takes i believe very strongly that it is better to do away with the grandfather clause for fiscal year 1982 so that those legal services grantees that have been doing a good job representing the indigent can be refunded at an adequate amount rather than attempting to squeeze at least 61 million less into the existing grant arrangement so for the sake of the legal services corporation grantees some discretion has got to be given to the new lsc board on which grantees will be refunded rather than giving half a loaf or twothirds of a loaf or threequarters of a loaf to all of the grantees that have been on the federal gravy train i would ask the supporters of this legislation to think very seriously about the effects of trying to squeeze 321 million into 260 million or less with an automatic refunding provision for fiscal year 1982 it just cannot be done and for that reason i would urge this committee to repeal the presumptive funding provisions so as to give the new legal services corporation board the discretion to pick and choose which grantees will be refunded and to refund those grantees adequately rather than trying to stretch the dollar too far"], [3.812669149283465e-07,

establishment of radio marti the administration proposed the creation of this new radio station for broadcasting to cuba as one of the few peaceful options available to the united states in confronting the insidlous penetration of cuban aggression in this hemisphere by broadcasting news reports and commentaries to the people of cuba radio marti would serve the same vital role as radio free europe and radio liberty serve in broadcasting to the soviet bloc in europe for tens of millions of east europeans the most reliable information about their country comes from the outside world there is no comparable source of news for those living in cuba the radio marti project is consistent with international law which is in contrast to the cuban governments practice of jamming unitedstates domestic stations the illegal cuban broadcasts have already continued more than 10 years and are a serious problem however we cannot base unitedstates policy on some threat from the cubans that they will increase their jamming activities the creation of radio marti is an important ingredient in bringing to the cuban people the reality of their governments failure at home and its subversive activities abroad the concept of radio marti is based on the right of the people of cuba to seek receive and impart information snd ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers in accordance with article 19 of the universal declaration of human rights nonetheless opponents of the measure have raised a number of questions some have questioned why an am frequency has been proposed for radio marti am receivers are common in cubasome 2 12 million receivers at last estimatewhereas shortwave receivers are not cuba does not use shortwave broadcasting domestically so the average cuban does not need to own one furthermore since the revolution shortwave sets have been very difficult to acquire shortwave broadcasts would thus probably reach only the political elite while the international radio regulations state that in principle the am band is for domestic service in practive it is well established that this band is also used for international broadcasting the bbc deutsche welle west germany radio free europe voice of america radio moscow and radio havana all use the am band in addition to shortwave for their international broadcasts another question concerns the reason for the 10 million authorization for the radio the cost of radio marti cannot be compared to the cost of establishing a commercial station for unitedstates domestic broadcasting radio marti can be compared with radio free europe and radio liberty its costs include not only expensive fourtower directional antennas but also high personnel and administrative costs required by its unique research and program development requirements these include spanish language requirements studios reporters and researchers based in unitedstates cities and overseas some have also asked why the voice of america could not serve radio martis purposes voas purposes and operations are radically different from those for radio free europe and radio liberty and thus from those proposed for radio marti voas mission is worldwide and its primary purposes are to present world news and to express and explain unitedstates official policy and american society and institutions the charter does not contemplate a surrogate home service like radio marti for the same reason radio free europe and radio liberty have maintained separate identities and operations from those of the voa attempting to focus on the news of one country such as cuba would violate the charter of the voice of america and would completely change the nature of its broadcasting efforts much concern has also been expressed about the problem of cuban radio interference with unitedstates broadcasters and whether radio marti will worsen this problem these concerns are addressed in this bill and were discusied extensively in committee but with recognition that the problem of cubn interference with unitedstates domestic broadcasting predates radio marti by at least 15 years and should be coiidered as a separate issue indeed the very broadcasters who today are most seriously damaged by cuban interferencethose in floridaare strongly in favor of the creation of radio marti the fundamental point is that cuban interference with broadcasting efforts in the united states will not cease if radio marti does not go on the air long before radio marti in the mid1960s the castro government embarked on a program to redesign its domestic am broadcasting system and to initiate broadcasting directed toward the united states and other neighboring countries new cuban plans to increase significantly the number and power of its am radio stations to meet both internal and external requirements were announced in 1979 as part of a 5year plan and were submitted to the international frequency registration board in may 1980 were cubas plans to be implemented its stations would cause greatly increased interference with unitedstates broadcasters cubas broadcasting plans were made known well before our announcement in september 1981 that we intended to establish radio marti the problem of increasing cuban interference is a separate and distinct issue which will remain whether radio marti goes on the air on not the question of how cuba would react to radio marti cannot be answered at this time although logic and technology dictate three possibilities one cuba may take no action at all the voice of america has been broadcasting to cuba for more than 21 years and cuba has not seriously tried to jam or interfere with these broadcasts two cuba may seek to prevent radio martis signals from reaching its cuban audience jamming by lowpowered transmitters cuban radio receivers this would have no appreciable effect on unitedstates broadcasters including those using the same frequency as radio marti it also would not prevent reception of radio marti in cuba three cuba may try counterbroadcasting however cuban intentions to broadcast with high power on 1040 khz and 1160 khz predate radio marti and are not in reprisal for radio marti in fact cuba chose 1040 khz as a broadcast frequency in contravention of the old north american regional broadcasting agreement of which cuba was a signatory before the united states chose the same frequency for radio marti there is no reason to believe that cuba will relinquish its interest in 1040 khz if radio marti does not go on the air or if radio marti broadcasts on another frequency in fact cuba is already broadcasting on 1160 khz with high power despite the rejection by the 1981 rio conference of cubas application to use that nd many other frequencies even if cuba uses frequencies not allocated to it the use of directional antennas could prevent interference with unitedstates domestic broadcasting furthermore cuba may broadcast to the caribbean and central or south america rather than to the united states even with the establishment of radio marti the united states will still remain far behind the soviet union and cuba in the amount of resourcc and time devoted to international radio broadcasts i believe it is essential that we meet this challenge and provide for the creation of this new voice of truth for the cuban people it is often charged and by many in this body that the united states is losing the battle of ideas and that we are not doing what we should to counter the soviet union unfortunately although we clearly

agreement with what the gentleman is saying i do not think we should destroy a program that basically works well not only for the farmer but that consumers ought to remember there is only 20 cents that farmer is getting out of that jar of peanut butter somebody else is getting all the rest it is not excessive and if the program works well and provides us with a reasonable amount of cost involved in that particular product i think it is very important that we maintain that program we also need this group or this coalition on agriculture here in this body to make sure that the corn programs the sugar programs and all the other things get the support and we support one another basically that is the message to the gentleman from south carolina that i have i support your program i certainly hope that you support the programs that are so necessary to a dying industry such as the sugar industry in michigan"], [0.49894195795059204, 0.998941957950592, 1, "i thank the gentleman for

result of many years of dealing with this troublesome problem and finally reaching what i think is a fiscally sound solution to it there have been other proposals which have been passed around and submitted to those of us on the public works committee as alternatives some from the private sector some other agencies of government i have discussed here with members of the subcommittee as well as with the secretary of transportation and other officials in the administration and it appears that after this extensive examination and discussion that this present solution presents us the best

executive branch or the house or the senate at this time what i shall address myself to is what this present resolution does the rate of expenditures under this resolution is 400 billion a year it is the same as the level which has been in place since october 1 the agreement in the continuing resolution just vetoed was 427 billion so we will be saving money so far as spending money for such period as this exists because we will be operating at a level of 400 billion a year instead of 427 billion approximately which the other resolution contained my reasoning in setting this date after consultation is that we cannot act properly within a very limited period the other resolution has been sent back to the appropriations committee where we will invite contributions from the executive or anybody else and be glad to consider those matters i think we should do that i think it is so important that we get along together the executive and the legislative departments of government also may i say that if we did not do it in a few days which we could not we then have christmas coming up and i know with all of the things we have had we do not care to be tied up here through christmas then if we go beyond christmas how far should we go the resolution which i introduced last night provides for february 25 i tried to take a number of matters into consideration so i selected february 25 but after being urged to shorten it i put it ahead of that date to february 3 february 3 is a date which would give us a chance to know what the new budget recommendation will be so i think february 3 is as short as we reasonably can make it and still keep some order in our deliberations as we proceed with our work in order to be fair and may i say they did not demand it but in order to give the minority the same position that we take we do provide in the unanimous consent request which was accepted that the minority have the right to make one motion such as they may see fit to make the two votes on that and on final passage would be all that would be required i repeat again we have put the time date as short as we think we can afford to we have not tried to make it drag out but the longer it is the more money we save because we are proceeding under that rate of 400 billion a year whereas the resolution which had been sent back to our committee would be 427 billion a year"],

have under public law 96511 omb is responsible for insuring that agencies in developing rules and regulations use efficient methods to collect use and disseminate needed information clearly the provisions contained in h r 7158 does not change or in any way modify ombs authorities under the paperwork act further no reference was make to the paperwork act in the bill since public law 96511

about orderly marketing to a group of farmers in five states and part of many other states that they would otherwise not have this congress is going to have to make a decision as to whether or not it

clear how these entitlement programs have in fact gotten out of hand and that the fairest way to deal with this issue as the gentleman has suggested is to handle all entitlements in the same way with the idea of maybe freezing everything that does not mean cutting them way back as the gentleman has stated it merely means holding down the increases for a short time and that that in and of itself would produce a great result on the spending side of our budget it would treat every single element of our society that benefits by those entitlements the same way and it would be the most positive and constructive way of dealing with this problem of trying to bring federal spending under control i had an opportunity last weekend while in my district to discuss this issue with some of our federal retirees some of those who have retired from the military some of those presently serving in the ipilitary and some on various kinds of social security benefits though no one is happy with the thought of freezing or putting a freeze on spending increases especially in the many entitlement programs the overwhelming majority of those people to whom i spoke and discu3sed this issue said that they thought that that fairest way to handle this problem was to have it equal across the board i think they made it clear that though they probably would not be happy with it that was the best way to deal with the problem if everybody was required to sacrifice an increase under automatic escalation clauses that presently exist in law and so i again wish to join with my other colleagues in saying to the gentleman from oregon thank you for bringing these facts and figures to the attention of the house to making it clear how we could achieve a balanced budget far more quickly if we were willing to establish some type of a fair freeze across the board on all entitlement programs and all basic programs in our federal budget in the various categorical areas of our federal budget"]]}
