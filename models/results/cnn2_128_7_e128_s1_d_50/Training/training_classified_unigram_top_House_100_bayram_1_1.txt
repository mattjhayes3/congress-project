of senior citizens i applauded the initiative of president reagan in presenting such a program to congress last year unfortunately many of those good ideas are not present in h r 2470 it was difficult for me to vote against the medicare catastrophic protection act because i support the goal of the bill elderly persons are often faced with costly longterm health problems that can bankrupt even those who have insurance or have saved for such disasters senios deserve some protection from devastating iilouss h r 2470 has some good points for example it allows for mammogram screenings will keep spouses of nursing home patients from forced poverty and limits the amount of outofpocket expenses for doctor care and hospital services the weak points of the bill however forced me to vote against it first the bill does not address the most pressing health problem of senior citizens longterm care over 80 percent of health care expenses incurred by the elderly are related to longterm home care and nursing home costs nine out of 10 private or medigap insurance policies do not cover nursing home care which averagas 25 000 per year h r 2470 does very little to help the victims of stroke alzheimers disease or other severe illness second the bill requires all medicare eligible individuals to pay a supplemental premium or surtax this tax which could be as much as 800 next year is not fair to persons who have saved for their health care or have purchased private insurance policies this will force senior citizens to become dependent on the federal government even if they do not need or want to third the potential exists under the new prescription drug benefit for medicare subscribers to bear the cost of treating aids patients victims of aids who qualify for medicare under the disability provisions would also qualify for the drug benefit it is not fair to force seniors to shoulder the burden of the very expensive 10 000 per yearl aids treatment finally the bill could cost seniors a lot of extra money without giving them many extra benefits each year the premiums and deductibles will be indexed to cover the cost of the programs this means that to keep medicare solvent only a very few individuals will actually reap the benefits for example only 7 percent of eligible beneficiaries currently meet the part b outofpocket limit and oni 16 percent exceed the prescription drug deductible these levels will be maintained although i could not support h r 2470 i will continue to work to make true catastrophic and longterm health care benefits available in a fair and

obligations in 1982 the congress passed the original prompt payment act which i supported to eliminate late payments by government agencies to federal contractors the act has been successful in reducing this practice by 40 percent since 1982 but unfortunately it has not ended it entirely some government agencies continue to delay payments by exploiting certain loopholes in the current law and taking advantage of grace periods which were established to allow the agencies to adjust their payment systems to the new requirements it is time to put a stop to this federal government agencies

accomplish this by way of several amendments to current law grace periods will be phased out and completely eliminated by october 1 1989 late payment interest penalties ill be doubled for agencies which 1o not pay contractors who are entitled to receive payment within 10 days of the principal billing in addition agencies will no longer be allowed to refuse formal acceptance of invoices so as to delay repayment and the unitedstates postal service will be subject to the act as of october 1 1988 it is vitally necessary that we take action on this matter by adopting s 328 we will complete the

such time as i may consume as a senior member of the committee which has reported the bill which is included as title x of this legislation i am pleased to recommend this title to my colleagues i must acknowledge at the outset that the unitedstates trade representative is opposed to this title for a number of reasons which i would like to respond to during these remarks title x pertains to a special part of international commerce procurement by national governments it is based on the philosophy that government procurements should insofar as possible be open to companies from all nations bidding products made anywhere in the world the title seeks to encourage application of this philosophy by establishing a very simple and very fair rule when a foreign government discriminates in making procurements against americanmade products we may close our governments procurements to products of the offending country the united states has been a world leader in encouraging full and open competition in government procurement for products of all nations we have done this not only by engaging in that practice ourselves but also by stimulating the creation and expansion of the international agreement on government procurement and even in opening many defense procurements on an equal basis to foreign as well as domestic firms these actions have made it possible for foreign companies to sell more and more goods and services to the unitedstates government what have american businesses received in return they still face a world in which other national governments actively subsidize and finance their countries firms they still face a world in which other national governments engage in practices which deny procurements to american companies some of those practices are blatant and others are more subtle but they all have the same effect while our government is expanding opportunities for foreign businesses to sell to it other governments are systematically shutting american firms out of their markets title x says its time for the united states to stop playing the role of patsy in the international government procurement market its time that we look out for the interests of our own businesses by ensuring that they have just as much chance to compete for foreign government procurements as foreign firms have to compete here title x gives the president the authority and the flexibility to enforce this desire it empowers him to identify foreign governments which discriminate against american companies negotiate with then for fair treatment and apply sanctions against them when negotiations fall the title requires that the president proceed through internationally sanctioned dispute resolution procedures and permits him to impose sanctions which make our response appropriate to the nature and degree of discrimination we face i have tremendous confidence in the american business community i believe that given a fair opportunity in foreign government markets it can compete successfully a high percentage of the time if this title is enacted and properly implemented it will permit our companies to increase their sales all over the world this will increase jobs in the united states and it will increase government revenues through taxes on earnings i urge my colleagues to join me in giving their support to title x of the bill"],

may be more likely to take this dramatic move during a future crisis the advantage of midg3tman and rail gardson based mx is that they will be able to move during a cdsls and possibly avoid destruction in a soviet first strike so adding the midgetman and the mx to our strategic arsenal will help prevent a nuclear war from ever occurring and according to anyones definition thats real

amendments before us today offer only partial solutions to our need to modernize our landbased nuclear deterrent the rowland amendment would delete all funds for the midgetman conversely the hertel amendment would delete all funds for the mx rail garrison program congressman dickinson has offered an amendment that would add funds to the mx program to 650 million by transferring funds from the

disappointment and outrage but more importantly in the future that we are going to be watching very closely the actions of that government in that region"], [0.49465078115463257, 0.9946507811546326, 1, "if i may be allowed to take back my time the gentleman is absolutely correct the gentleman is correct on two accounts one important account is that the authorizing committee does not have to meet the budget resolutions the appropriating committee does but the gentleman also knows that as a practical matter on the floor here if the authorizing committee were to bring back a defense bill that is in excess of the amount in the budget resolution we would run into an immediate storm of protest and indeed we would end up with an acrosstheboard cut to make sure that we were back within some consistency with the budget the gentleman is correct what we ought to do is allow the appropriators some leeway by authorizing more than the budget resolution we should authorize more in order to allow the appropriators some leeway to make some changes and still stay within the budget resolution if we are going to do that we will have to educate our colleagues here and let them accept the idea that the authorizing committee could being in a bill that is inconsisent with the budget resolution because as the political situation exists now if i were to show up on the floor with an authorizing bill in excess of the budget numbers i would get an enormous number of amendments to cut it and bring it down and members would vote for those amendments to bring it down"], [0.49498867988586426,

gentleman from wisconsin said that it is no wonder that people do not go to the polls and vote when they see action like this i would suggest that perhaps one of the reasons people do not go to the polls and vote is because voters are being told so many things by some members of this body that just are not so i would suggest that the gentleman from nebraska has just accurately summarized what is and is not at stake on this issue let me make matters clear first of all the gentleman from wisconsin indicated that this rule is here because it was brought here by the democrat leadership bending the rules the fact is that this bill is here at the request of thedemocratic and republican leadership it is here at the request of myself among a good many other people because we are trying to support a compromise with a republican administration even though i myself have strong doubts about that compromise this is a body in which you have to try to have 535 men and women work their will in a united way and in a way which does not make the united states look silly in the process that is what we are trying to do by supporting the administrations request for today second it was stated that this vote is a vote pure and simple on the gci that is simply not correct this vote is simply a vote on whether or not we are going to allow a vote on authorizing every item in the bill which is unauthorized to put that in perspective the gci proposition is about 50 million all of the other unauthorized items in this bill are about 14 billion i would say that the vote on the rule is the furthest thing possible from a vote specifically on the gci it is simply a vote on whether or not we are going to do what we have done many times in the past namely authorize legislation which has not been able to make it through the authorization process so that we can avoid a continuing resolution if members want to be on a continuing resolution if we want to be here saturday if we want to be here next week and violate our promise to the president to produce 13 appropriation bills without going to a cr then vote against the motion if you want to enable the house to meet the obligation to pass 13 appropriation bills in a timely way although we may all have disagreements about specific items in the bill then you support the motion of the committee on rules and go on and support the obey motion let me say also that the assertion was also made by the gentleman from kentucky that if members vote for this they will not be able to do anything at all about the gci for the next 6 years is the furthest thing possible from the truth we have limited oci appropriations in the obey amendment to 50 million not 70 million precisely because a good many people on this side of the aisle share a feeling that i think is held on the part of many people on that side of the aisle that at the present time our third world policy the baker policy and the policies of the world bank are in some respects misguided we think that they do not specifically take into account the need for our own agriculture sector to grow and our own manufacturing sector to grow so we have limited the appropriation to 20 million below the amount requested by the administration and i have a letter here which i am sending to the secretary of the treasury today and i would invite anyone to sign it who would like to sign it with me which simply states here that future appropriations for the oci over each of the next 6 years are going to be determined to a very great extent by the manner in which the treasury department and the world bank handle this entire question of third world debt i do not believe that we ought to provide american support for any structural loan if that country is required to devote more than 20 percent of its foreign exchange to repay loans because i think that messes up their ability to buy our own products if any of you are interested in joining with me on that letter i would be happy to have your name on it but the fact is this rule allows the house to do what it has an obligation to do which is to send it to the president before october 1"], [0.49511873722076416,

and how much time we have spent talking about the united statesbacked contris let there be no doubt in anyones mind whose side i am on and why i believe the first vote we cast today is a very significant one because it is a vote on the bonior foreignaid plan it is not a contra aid plan only onethird of the money in this bonior foreignaid plan will go to the contras the other twothirds of these dollars in this foreignaid bill are going to go to anybody else but the contras and that is a fact in fact 25 percent of the money in this first vote will go to the sandinistas and let nobody try to explain that that is not the case because i ask the members to show me one communist country anywhere in the world that allows free and independent agencies to make independent decisions of how those dollars we are going to give to the ortega brothers that we allow them to distribute that money as they see fit and believe that is going to go to children that need help come on who are we kidding this is a minimarshall plan for central america before the war is over who are we kidding who are we kidding to send money we do not have to both sides before the negotiations have in fact

the last as the forest service completes its studies and plants we are going to see some statewide bills come in which provide for the protection of these rivers these rivers throughout our nation is where we have the greatest pleasure of any resource when we look to the west we see the impact in terms of agrarian areas and all the types of conflicting activities that go on there as the advocates of some of the river bills have mentioned rivers is where the action is that is where the people are that is where the industry is that is where a good amount of conflict comes between the idea of preserving a resource like this and utilizing it we think that a proper balance can be maintained but some of these areas are very special like the wildcat river brook or stream whatever is the appropriate nomenclature for this site certainly deserve our protection this is a short segment but invariably these small segments this 14 mile segment is one that represents closetohome resource for the people of new hampshire that sees extensive utilization it is a depiction i think of the type of life the qualify of life that exists in that good state obviously this measure is going to be enacted in this congress with the action by the senate and our work here but i hope that in years to come and months to come we will see many more of these classified and fall under the stewardship of either the park service or forest service or the state governments as appropriate or local governments to provide a commitment to maintain these resources which really reflect so much of what is our nation i have no further requests for time and i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.49594247341156006, 0.9959424734115601, 1, "my colleagues and the american public in the next couple of days we are going to vote on a variety of amendments all of which will probably have more significance in the newspapers across the country than this one this amendment may in the long run be the most important amendment that we pass in this whole bill for two reasons pirst of all as colleagues and as members of the congress we must put on record that we are not going to allow the black programs of this country to grow and to allow the building of defense programs without our close scrutiny both technologically as well as financially second we are in the midst of developing what could become in history the most expensive weapons system in our country and that it would be improper for us to allow this project to continue and not to represent the people at home without the type of information this amendment grants us to see i think it is important to point out that not one person stood up on the floor of the house in opposition to this amendment and i think that points clearly to the opportunity which is available to us today with the passage of this amendment"]]}
