first congratulating the gentleman from ohio and the members of the republican budget committee in the 8 years that i have been in congress and watched this budget process this is the most professional most dedicated and most real effort that i have seen by any budgeteering group they have got the right conceptual framework that we ought to grow down the size of the government and allow more freedom to grow up the freeenterprise sector of the american economy that only by growth in the private sector can we generate the revenues to support this enormous government spending program and only then can we decrease the deficit if we combine with that growth in revenues from a growing private sector a containment of growth in the public sector it takes courage it takes commitment it takes details a few weeks ago we were challenged on our side of the aisle to put up or shut up and the fact of the matter is the republicans on the committee on the budget put up details pain sacrifice not sacrifice by those of us who senator gramm says are pulling the wagon and paying higher taxes by heaping on more taxes but sacrifice by those who are in the wagon by reductions in government largesse and containment of the size of government what do we have from the democrats the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is the massive tax increases which are immediate and certain on all of the american people and if in fact you happen to be earning 30 000 a year and suffering a tax increase by this clinton plan they will perform the magic of redefinition and give you by a redefinition of your income the status of being a wealthy american by imputing to you through the government alleged earnings of your children the rental value of your home the inside value buildup of your retirement programs the cheating on your taxes that this government under clinton is assuming that we all do by either unreported or underreported income they will make you wealthy this presidency is going to make us all wealthy by simply redefining income now in addition to that pain we have the payoff to all of the government agencies the supporters the communities in addition to all of that payoff in thisgovernment stimulate pork package we have then the promise the promise we have all heard before to the american citizens is once again the democrats have said take the pain of the higher taxes allow us to fulfill the payoff to our constituency groups allow us to provide the pork early and we promise you the cuts later ladies and gentlemen the cuts will not arrive the cuts will not get off the launching pad the cuts are the fiction of democratic budgetary policy the pain is real the suffering is optional vote for kasich vote against the democrats fiction the plan offered by president clinton and the democrat majority and the one developed by the budget committee republicans offer the american people a stark contrast in our respective parties approach to tax and budget policy the democrats want to tax the people and grow the government while republicaos want to grow the private sector and constrain the government the democrat package contains the largest tax increase in american history and tens of billions in new spending by contrast the republican alternative cuts spending and the deficit 430 billion without increasing taxes without slashing defense and without cutting social security the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is massive tax increases which are immediate and certain the payoff is the stimulate government package which even the washington post notes is an effort to reward democrat constituencies with taxpayer money and the promiseone weve heard so many times befores that a few years from now well cut government spending in reality the democrat plan will grow the government and shrink the economy it will mean fewer jobs for ordinary americans particulariy when coupled with the new wave of regulations we are certain to see on behalf of big labor and other special interests the reason job growth has been stagnant is that the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent in the last few years and i remind my democrat friends that during the reagan boomthe longest peacetime expansion of the economy in history it was small business that created 75 percent of the new jobs in america what does the republican plan do it achieves more deficit reduction than the clinton plan by reducing federal spending less than 3 percent thats right 3 percent its appalling that my friends in the democrat majority and the new democrats in the white house would stick the american taxpayer with the largest tax increase in american history while refusing to reduce government by even 3 percent in fact the democrat plan adds tens of billions in new spending while the democrat plan asks all americans to pay higher taxes for more government the republican plan asks the beneficiaries of government largesse to contribute to deficit reduction the republican plan cuts federal overhead reduces congress bloated budget asks wealthy medicare recipients to pay a larger portion of their health care costs requires federal workers to work until age 62 like everyone else instead of retiring at 55 it reforms foreign aid puts medicaid patients in a managed care program and saves taxpayer dollars by empowering lowincome americans to use housing vouchers instead of building expensive crimeridden public housing and best of all the republican plan eliminates unnecessary programs and government agencies like the interstate commerce commission which was created in 1887 to regulate the railroads i would like to compliment my colleague mr kasich and the other republicans on the budget committee for putting together an honest fair and wellbalanced plan that reduces the deficit without raising taxes this plan attacks the root of our deficit problem runaway federal spending balancing the budget and encouraging a prosperous and growing economy requires a twopoint plan we must first limit government spending as this plan daes and we must pass a progrowth package which reduces the cost of capital and labor and encourages our people to save and invest i would say in closing that the clinton taxandspend plan will fail as i told another president 3 years ago durtng the 1990 budget summit higher tas and ~her spending will stifle growth in the private eoonomy kim jobs and not reduce the deficit the cinton plan is the 1990 budget deal pan ii in super 3d with twice the tax increase i urge my coieagues to reject the big

hope that middle america is paying attention to this debate because one of the most salient points that was just made was that president clinton has proposed what is called an economic stimulus package that is costing 16 5 billion and it is not even included in the budget that they are talking about all the deficit spending that is in that budget which is into the billions and billions and billions of dollars even though there is a 400 billionplus tax increase in there does not include this 16 billion socalled economic stimulus package that is filled with pork g it has got swimming pools in there for various communities around the country it has got gymnasiums in there for various communities around the country it has got parking garages in there it has got libraries in there these are things that local communities ought to pay for but taxpayers from around the country are taking care of their friends in alabama and their friends in florida and their friends in california with these porkbarrel projects and the thing that is most irksomeabout this if there is such a work is that the president has not even put it in this budget it is 16 billion more that is going to be added to the debt in addition to what this does i just heard from my colleagues this is going to increase the national debt by 586 billion over the next year i wonder how many other things we are going to have added to this debt over the next year certainly this 16 5 billion socalled economic stimulus package which i call pork package is going to be added in addition to it we have to start coining new words new definitions around here today i started one clintonomics remember reaganomics everybody criticized remember clintonomics because it is going to cost 1 4 million jobs in the next 4 to 5 years that is how many jobs we aregoing to lose at least according to most economists clintonomics and it is going to lead to a clintastrophy an economic clintastrophy find that in your lexicon if it is not there now it should be the first thing we ought to do is start addressing the problem of government spending just 10 years ago we had our first 1 trillion national debt now we are almost to 4 5 trillion in debt it took us 200 years to get to 1 trillion and less than 10 years to more than quadruple it and what are we doing instead of cutting spending we are raising your taxes more than double the largest tax increase in unitedstates history and that is supposed to solve our problems remember that when you get your paycheck next year remember that when you pay your utility bill and you are paying 400 500 more for gas or electricity inyour home next year because that btu tax the bigtime unemployment tax we call it is going to be hitting each and every one of you the problem is this really concerns me is that the media has not really gone into the program and explained it to the american people it is no wonder to me that the people of this country want president clinton to succeed i want him to succeed but at the same time while he is succeeding i do not want to see him take the economy right down the tubes to a degree that is worse than what we have seen over the last 3 to 4 years we raised taxes in 1990 to the tune of 184 billion and what did it cost it cost us jobs and it cost us an economic recession now they are raising taxes more than double that sure we want president clinton to succeed but we want the economy to succeed even more and the way to make sure the economy succeeds and grows so that we create more jobs and do not lose them overseas is to cut government spending first that is the key government spending is out of control we brought in 500 billion in tax revenues 10 years ago now it is 1 2 trillion almost triplewhat we brought in 10 years ago yet we are still running 300 to 400 billion in red each year so raising taxes is not the answer since we raised taxes 184 billion in 1990 for every 1 in new taxes we have spent 2 70 so the problem is not that we are not getting enough revenue the problem is spending is out of control and they will not make the hard declslotis on cutting spending we had a proposal called the 2percent solution that would freeze all government spending and no more than a growth rate of 2percent per year over the previous year they would not let us even bring it out of the committee on rules to the floor that would have balanced the budget in 6 years without a tax increase that is the problem they want to raise taxes and they want to spend us into oblivion and they are going to do it unless america rises up and says no more no more the problem is they face a dilemma that benjamin franklin said the second continental congress faced and that is they have to either hang together or hang separately and

of us in the michigan delegation knew that paul henry was sick but we held out hope that a miracle might happen and that the day that came would never come but now that it has i realize that the true miracle is the courage and the bravery that paul henry showed in the face of unbelievable odds and unbeatable odds and the passion with which he lived his life history tells us on the day that john kennedy died a tailor in new york city put up a sign on the door that read closed today due to death in the family that is i think how we all feel it is ike we have had a death in our family we did not see eyetoeye on every issue but i do not think there was a member of this body who was more respected and more liked than paul henry and we are all going to miss him while flying out to the funeral last month somebody asked me how he thought paul would be remembered and it struck me then that paul henry was a man of some very interesting contradictions very midwestern contradictions we know from the many causes fought right here on this house floor that he was both softspoken and persuasive selfdeprecating and proud deeply religious as mr wolf has indicated yet a firm believer in mans ability to effect his own fate politically paul was a deeply patriotic man who spoke out against flag burning a fiscal conservative who voted in favor of extending unemployment benefits a defense supporter who said no to both the mx missile and the nicaraguan contras it seemed that paul was not so concerned with the right or the left as he was with the right and the wrong he followed i think what we all strive to follow in our own public life and hopefully in our personal lives an inner compass and worked hard to make this country a better place to live and i think that is how he is going to be remembered i always got the feeling that to paul the richest life the fullest life is a life that is dedicated to helping others whether through the peace corps as he did in his early career or as a teacher as he did for many years before he came to the legislature in lansing and of course am a legislator here where he made his true mark and if paul could see us i think paying tribute to him this evening i have a feeling he would probably wonder what we were all doing standing around when there is so much work to be done i think sometimes if we had a few more paul henrys around here we would shout at each other a lot less and we would work together a lot more so our thoughts today go out to pauls wife karen and his children kar and jordan and megan their father was a credit to this institution and to our state of michigan and we will miss him in the days ahead as we lead this national through some difficult times i hope we can all show a little bit of courage and bravery and dedication that marked paul henrys entire life in the end that would be the highest tribute we can pay to him let me also say at the close of my remarks how much i appreciate and think the whole delegation appreciates the warm and touching friendship that fred upton had with paul henry fred was with him through thick and thin on thisfloor and through the very difficult battle he had at the

has been prescribed with regard to mixed population in fact this legislation regarding mixed populations provides an orderly way to provide the type of elderlyonly population that would avoid some of the conflicts that are occurring with serious problems in our nations public housing as the chairman indicated this was enacted over 4 years ago i think the administration has not been timely in implementing the rules and regulations but just this past year such rules and regulations are now proximate and ready to be put into place to provide the type of protection accorded by the thenkleczka amendment supported by my colleague from minnesota the fact is that the litany of concerns that have been expressed are common concerns but they do not just evolve from the people living within public housing they in fact are very often coming from the total neighborhood around the public housing where nonresidents of the public housing actually gain access we cannot assure the elderly of the type of security that the proponents of this amendment advocate in the absence of an overall program dealing with the total community or the neighborhoodwithin which ing a judgment that has no bearing in tlatsenioroitizen only housing exists fact with regards to the conduct of the we have to deal not just with what is indiiidual in requiring the signing of going on in the building but in the im such

access to it tegrity of the screening process and of madam chairman that isone of the course entire families would be if one reasons that this legislation includes individual in that family and if that is the community partnerships against the primary person that is qualified for crime measure that was advocated by the benefit there is no provision made the administration and introduced by here to deal with it so i thinkaland supported by the committee so it ready has the authority to do this and is in this legislation to try and in a much more sense be proactive in working with and madam chairman i would urge the limiting the access to the building and amendment be defeated the activities that are going on around mr castle madam chairman i the building in this instance aid so move to strike the requisite number of those individuals gain access they words have no right to be there madam chairman i rise in support of furthermore as i said i think that this amendment i listened very

public housing but in all pub is absolutely no issue whatsoever that lic housing and i think it is important even comes close or maybe in the agthat they begin to do a more rigorous gregate which comes close to their job in terms of screening so they al concern with the problem of mixed ready have that particular responsibil populations it is a tremendous probity lem preying on the lives of these senior i think the problem with this legisla citizens tion is the problem with an effort to madam chairman these places were try to take an issue which may be ap created basically to aid those

literal reading of the lations and a lot of those people had language would bar anyone with a dis problems even if they did not have ability that is a nonelderly person that problems they were young they tendhas a history of use of alcohol or drugs ed to live different life styles if my and constitutes a disability well the colleagues will but we add and fact is there are numerous individuals compound itwith the problems which in our society that have gone through they had and all of a sudden we had a rehabilitation but are still interpreted situation which was explosive and and diagnosed as being addicted ad which has created tremendous probdicted to alcohol or addicted to some lems in senior housing complexes other drug but in fact just because throughout the united states of amerthey have the addiction does not mean ica and i think that this hopefully is in fact that they are any problem in the law of intended consequences and terms of behavior the fact is that not unintended consequences the inthose that have not been diagnosed tended consequences i hope that the would constitute the greater problem blutegrams amendment has is to and the greater issue and obviously make sure that we keep these popuwould not be as affected by this amend lations as separate as possible or if ment theyare going to be together and there any person who is not elderly the

days about the presidents health care plan but if you think their words sound familiar if you feel like you have heard them all before well you are right we have heard them all before in fact we heard many of the same doom and gloom predictions from republicans last year during the debate over the presidents budget plan then like now they are saying that the presidents ideas will make the sky fall will bring swarms of locusts and will make the seas boil in the words of that great statesman yogi berra its like deja vu all over again before we take their criticism to heart i think we should check the record and see how accurate their predictions turned out to be last year let us recall some of the words we heard from republicans during last years budget debate one republican told us that the presidents budget would lead to and i quote a jobkilling recession another told us that the budget was clearly a jobkiller in the short run and that the impact on job creation would be devastating another said that the budget would mean and i quote again a higher national debt deficits running 350 billion a year more unemployment higher interest rates and higher inflation speaker after republican speaker repeated the same exact line and one gentleman even said to those of us who voted for the plan this is now your package we will come back here next year and try to help you when this puts the economy in the gutter well guess what next year is here the budget has had time to take effect and each and every one of their predictions has fallen flat on its face the truth is that today interest rates are down and homes sales are up inflation is down and auto sales are up unemployment is down and incomes are up and all told our economy has created more jobs in the past year alone than in the 4 years of president bush combined last summer the socalled experts were predicting that if we passed the presidents budget this years deficit would be 300 billion well the experts were wrong because we passed the plan this years deficit is projected to be under 180 billiona 40percent drop and if we stick with this plan we will post 3 consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since harry truman lived in the white house thats a good start and more needs to be done much more needs to be done but it just goes to show that when you make tough choices you get results so when you check the recordit shows that our friends on the other side of the aisle were 100 percent wrong about the presidents budget last year but now that they lost that battle theyre up to their old tricks again and they are bringing the same old scare tactics to the health care debate now they are telling us that guaranteed health insurance is quote socialism now or later and a dictatorship in health care they are telling us and i quote president clinton wants to deliver a monstrous governmentrun bureaucratic nightmare that is not reform and in response to the presidents

america fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me the american people are not going to be fooled again the republicans were wrong about the budget then and they are wrong about the health care plan now they did not get it then and they dont get it now well the american people get it they want a health system that covers everyone and provides all americans with health insurance that can never be taken away they want a health care system controlled by people who care about our health not just our wallets they want a system that protects and expands medicare and lets people choose their own doctors and health plan and want a health care system that everyone can depend on every day always after 50 years of starts and stops thats the plan president clinton has proposed for

one of the strong recommendations for putting george bush on the ticket was that he brought so much to the ticket with his depth of foreign policy experience something where there was some suspicion that ronald reagan would not have the kinds of credentials to convince america that he could handle the world at that very critical time it turned out that ronald reagan had some very clear ideas of where he wanted the world to go but he had a strong and energetic partner in george bush who helped formulate those policies throughout the reagan era and then brought that depth of experience into his own administration i think the changes that we have seen in the world are a tribute of course to ronald reagan for his vision of what the world could be but also to george bush for being the guy who in many instances went around the world to talk to the foreign leaders and move the process forward and then throughout his administration changed the world in such remarkable ways that people even thinking back on it cannot imagine all that was accomplished what strikes me about that is that he did it so well that by the time we got to the 1992 election america was ready to forget foreign policy they thought the world had been made so safe that we could ignore what was going on in the world turn to someone with a total lack of experience in world affairs for leadership because now was the time to focus on the domestic side of things and particularly on the domestic economy and i think we are now beginning to realize that having someone who understood the world could pick up the phone and call world leaders by their first names who had a longstanding relationship with them was in fact a major asset to this country and one that is terrible missed at the present time but it also seems to me that we do a disservice not to also mention that george bush showed tremendous courage in the management of domestic affairs and i am reminded of that over the last few weeks as i have been reading the stories in the newspaper about how the cable bill the cable regulation bill is beginning to come apart that all of the things that were predicted for it here on the house floor when it was passed are not coming true that in fact cable rates are going up and that the regulation by the government has turned out to be at least a mini disaster that was a case where george bush stood against the current of what he knew was going to happen on capitol hill a lot of us fought with him time after time to maintain his vetoes on capitol hill because we knew the way in which he was working to control the growth of government to control deficits and a lot of these kinds of things was through the power of his veto and time after time with our minimum numbers on capitol hill we were able to sustain those vetoes and president bush was very proud of that record of vetoes sustained and when we went to him and told him that on the cable bill he was likely to lose the easy thing for president bush to have done at that point would have been to say lets preserve the perfect record of vetoes i will go ahead i will hold my nose and i will sign that bill because the votes simply were not there we did not have enough votes to do something about the cable bill but he vetoed it anyway because he did believe that this would come back as something that would not serve the best interests of the american people at the timi he was heavily criticized consumer groups criticized him a lot of other people criticized him but it turns out he was more right than wrong and today a lot

special order i heard the gentleman from new mexico talking about the concept of multiple use and multiple use is an important concept that has served the public interest extremely well and is now under attack and it is not under attack overtly shall we say but it is very much under attack by efforts to further clamp down on and restrict the kinds of activities that can occur on the public lands i would like to just briefly mention that there is a movement to liberate the public lands from cattle grazing they had the phrase cattle free by 93 and i guess they will have to come up with a new one for 1994 and 1995 but i have no doubt but what that effort will continue to be waged there have been efforts to try and restrict public lands from mining activities we know very well the efforts in the pacific northwest with the northern spotted owl i call that a phony issue and i will say it here again on the floor of the house the spotted owl is really not the issue it is simply a vehicle in order to eliminate the logging from the public lands and the thinkers and the writers in this movement to advance the use of the spotted owl as a tool to stop logging they actually refer to it as a surrogate species meaning that it is a surrogate for actually the real intent which is to eliminate logging so we have all of these efforts going on and then there is an effort against agriculture and that is a twopronged effort one is to heighten public fears conceining food safety and we have seen various attempts at that with alar and the alar scare in california a few years ago and we will continue to see those efforts waged in terms of the use of chemicals pesticides and herbicides and so forth and when those cannot succeed there will be the second prong and that is to begin to restrict the availability of water and we see this being carried out it was carried out here in the congress agreed to by the president last year where we had a water project bill that was passed that in california may have helped other states other colleagues that are generally supportive and rightthinking on issues but in this case they joined together to produce i think a very sad result in the state of california where we have a longstanding water project i am sure many are aware that california has sort of unusual if not unique topography and we have massive amounts of water in one end of the state and the bulk of the population in the other end of the state even so the process of engineering projects and so forth over a number of years has made available this vast supply of water in the north to points south and the central valley project is one of those projects developed really to enable agriculture to obtain the water that it needed and of course the water that is impounded by the dams is available for us otherwise it simply flows out to the sea the central valley project has a yield of about 7 million acrefeet of water a year we just passed last year a bill that took about 1 million acrefeet of that 7 million and directed that it be used for nonagricultural purposes basically to be flushed through the delta which then leads to the san francisco bay and the convergence of the san joaquin and the sacramento rivers two of the states major rivers i mention this because california has soared tremendously in population i think we had about a 25percent population increase in the last years and we are projected in the region of the state i represent in northern california the sacramento area to have about a 33percent population increase about a onethird increase in our region we actually have oddly enough a federally authorized project construction was commenced inthe 1960s and we have 300 million dollars worth of footing work that has been performed there yet we cannot have not been able to bild on that to this point because we are caught up in this controversy of whether we build more dams the issue seems to be portrayed that the construction of a dam is somehow antithetical or contrary to the environmental interests and yet in this very case the construction of that particular dam and i would submit in many cases i would believe at least in this one we would enhance all of the environmental uses in the region this dam would ensure that there is enough water flow in the lower american river parkway a unique recreational resource in the state a river flowing through the urban areas which is heavily utilized by rafters in the lower american river and by those walking alongside it to ensure the natural beauty so fish are being killed right now or they were for the 6year drought that we had when the water levels dropped so low and the water became too warm for the fish and they died as a result and any time when we have less than the normal supply of water they will continue to die the reservoir at folsom lake was the most heavily utilized federally owned statemanaged recreation area in the state until the drought and the lake level dropped and our county in san joaquin county is heavily dependent on groundwater they were induced by the federal government not to develop this additional source of water but to defer that and to become part of the auburn dam project so the result has been that we have steadily been overpumping the groundwater in many cases permanently damaging the aquifer because we do not have enough surface water so here is an example of where water development would actually enhance all of these environmental uses from fisheries to maintenance of the flows in the lower american to recreation on the lower american and at the folsom lake and of course one of the most important environmental considerations in terms of quality of life for people is having an adequate supply of drinking water and water available for domestic and municipal uses as this particular dam would surely do so i for one join in this special order just to add my belief that we have got to put people first i think that was one of president clintons campaign themes putting people first we have to be good stewards of that which god has given us including the land and the water and the air and the resources but we have to recognize that we need an intelligent balanced multipleuse approach which recognizes the priority of human beings over other concerns while respecting those other concerns as we develop our policies so as not to damage or destroy them in the case of this particular dam the water development actually furthers every interest environmental as well as nonenvironmental and it is my belief that we are going to have to develop more water in the west which is a naturally arid region if we are to continue our progress and i am not asking by the way nor am i advocating or even indicating i would support the idea that somehow we do this at federal taxpayer expense i think the reagan administration was right to suggest that these are areas of concern that are appropriate for state and local action but obviously where the federal government has so much land and where the policies come in it has to be a willing partner where we develop these resources i think it is very important for the nation as we move ahead in these areas i thank the gentleman from wyoming for the opportunity to discuss some of these issues"], [0.0031880736351013184,

place this amendment keeps to that concept in my opinion but merely allows 3 additional years for exporters to eliminate flows"], [0.005071043968200684, 0.5050710439682007, 1, "today the white house

behalf of the indiana of robeson county and in all of north carolina however i rise today to oppose this bill i represent a district which encompasses the area of the eastern band of the cherokee indians in the early history of our nation congress and the administration often abused the american indians of this nation in my district andrew jackson tried to move the entire cherokee nation to oklahoma many died while walking the trail of tears which many people have heard about they are remembered in a drama on the cherokee reservation by those that stayedthat is those that evaded capture by the soldiersand those that returned back to western north carolina as we have heard before the bulk of indian tribes were established by treaty many of them following wars in this country what does it mean to be a federally recognized tribe it is a formal act that establishes a governmenttogovernment relationship between the united states and the recognized tribe it institutionalize the tribes quasisovereign status giving it the power to tax and to establisk a judiciary and it gives the tribe the right to treatment as a sovereign nation this relationship is unique in the world tribes view it as almost sacred many american indians died for this right it must be taken seriously and protected the history of federal recognition of indian tribes has been plagued with pitfalls and perceived as arbitrary and excessively political in 1975 the interior department after exhaustive consultations with indians established procedures to provide a uniform approach to the recognition process called the federal acknowledgement process fap the regulations set forth seven criteria a petitioning group must meet to be deemed a recognized tribe including a historical genealogical and cultural background what we would be doing today with this bill is to replace that orderly procsea and again return to a method where recognition is granted for arbitrary and political reasons this would be done contrary to the wishes of the majority of the american indians let there be no mistake about this vote this is a vote against the american indians not for them the cherokee nation the eastern band of which are located in my district strongly opposes this bill the hatteras tuscarora located among the lumbees in robeson county have stated that they oppose this bill under h r 334 they will be subsumed but they want to apply for tribal recognition through the fap process i bave received letters that support the fap process and a strict adherence to a systemic recognition process from various tribes in arizona california nevada north carolina oklahoma michigan washington oregon idaho montana california minnesota new mexico what i am saying to you is that the american indian has an established process for tribal recognition they want to keep this orderly process and not return to a political logrolling process do the lumbees deserve federal recognition i cannot answer that question and congress should not determine it if we do this what do we do with the numerous other groups across this nation who want to be recognized do we immediately put bills before this body to consider these groups and what about those groups who were turned down through the fap process can we say that those who were turned down should not be allowed to come back through the legislative process and if they can find a legislator here with enough power that they become federally recognized as a tribe of american indians let me emphasize that what the american indians and certainly the cherokee in my district have expressed eloquently to me is that they do not object and question this bill based on whether or not there will be a financial loss to one tribe versus another tribe they are not considering this from a monetary standpoint we appropriate precious little now to support the tribes of this country the tribes that i have met with have expressed to me their concern that we will dilute a very sacred recognition process and they consider it most serious they feel it will return tribal recognition to a political process that will depend more on political power rather than true indian heritage i urge my colleagues to do the right thing support the american indians of this country and vote against this bill"], [0.00876849889755249, 0.5087684988975525, 1, "i certainly thank the gentleman from texas i do rise today to urge my colleagues to vote yes for the recommit we all support crime control there is not a member in this house that does not feel we must do something about the crime in this country there have been two sticking points those sticking points have been the gun ban and the social programs the gun ban is not an issue it passed this house several months ago the gentleman from new york won that issue it is in the senate now so why in the world should we put it in the bill the same thing with social programs why should we put billions of dollars in this for social workers rather than criminals the gentleman from california and myself put together a bill h r 5008 that does several things it puts the money where it should be in prisons and in law enforcement officials we put 12 billion in this recommit for additional prisons within our states we put 12 billion in state grants for different law enforcement people the conference bill only puts 9 8 billion in cops on the street we put 2 5 billion for border patrol as opposed to 1 1 billion we put the three strikes and you are out we put truth in sentencing h r 5008 within the scope of this conference will do a lot to control crime in this country yet it costs 3 5 billion less than the conference bill i would urge this conference to move forward and vote for the recommit and let us put a bill out that costs taxpayers less and criminals more"], [0.012526094913482666, 0.5125260949134827, 1, "i move to strike the last word i rise in support of h r 2151 the maritime security and competitiveness act and in support of the cargo preference language included in this bill like the member who spoke before me i too would like to congratulate the chairman for working out the issue with reference to the great lakes which i think was an important objective cargo preference is an important tool our government uses to support the american shipping industry few people in this body blink when buyamerican amendments are offered to spending bills on this floor one will be offered to this bill i understand by the gentleman from ohio i believe strongly that the cargo preference laws are no different if we are going to use our taxpayers money to buy american we should also be using it to ship american lets remember cargo preference is not a handout if americanflagged vessels cannot offer a competitive and favorable rate with other foreign flag vessels then the americanflagged vessel is not used the cargo preference law is not intended to freeze out all foreign competition and it is not intended to pad the payroll of american shipping companies cargo preference like many of our agricultural subsidies puts americanowned americancrewed vessels on a level playing ground with unfair foreign competition unfortunately as long as there are flagofconvenience ships who do not even comply with modest safety health or environmental standards the playing field for american ships will never be level the cargo preference language in this bill reflects the compromise reached by agricultural and maritime interests in 1985 after lengthy discussions and it should be preserved i will therefore oppose an amendment to change that and want to congratulate the chairman and the ranking member and all of those who participated in bringing this bill to the floor and i urge strong support of h r 2151 and the preservation of its cargo preference provisions"]]}
