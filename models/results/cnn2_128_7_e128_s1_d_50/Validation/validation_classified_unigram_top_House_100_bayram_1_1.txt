and the ute mountain ute tribe have agreed to the provisions in section 5 of the house passed bill h r 2642 the two tribes are voluntarily converting their water right to a state water right if they choose to use it off reservation the resolution guarantees that the tribes may continue to hold their water rights on their reservations subject to the terms of the agreement the amendment was offered in order to alleviate the concerns of other tribes that section 5 c 1 of h r 2642 might somehow subject indian reserved water rights to the principles of abandoment and forteiture contained in state law put more simply this resolution is consistent with the intent of h r 2642 the indians water rights only become state water rights when used off reservation and only if the tribes elect to use the water off reservation the resolution also ensures that h r 2642 is not viewed as a precedent for future settlement or judicial decisions involving the issue of offreservation leasing of indian reserved water rights this has been accomplished by elaborating on the exi sting provisions of section 11 b of h r 2642 this was done to eliminate any use of h r 2542 as a precedent in other settlements or in litigation this has been done by stating that this act is intended solely to permit settlement of existing and prospective litigation among the signatory parties to the agreement this language was originally developed to protect the lower basin states it applies however to any party who was not a signatory to the agreement this includes other indian tribes and states the

intent of the resolution is to make absolutely certain that the principles and concepts contained in this settlement are not viewed as a precedent for future settlements or litigation in the area of

through the panama canal that is a major port of americas commerce now i have a lot of friends who have large farming areas i have a large farming area myself i know we have heard that it has been very difficult for farming communities in the midwest for example when they are undergoing tough economic times to understand why it is important to be concerned about that part of the world one reason they should be concerned is that about 50 percent of the exports the grain that is sold for export from their farming communities goes through that canal and now if it does not go through the canal i asked one of the people at the canal one of the executives i said what happens if you dont go through the canal he said then you have to go all the way around south america one affect that that has on our grain markets is that then perhaps it will go to different customers because our grain is going to be more expensive than it would be if it went through the canal the point is that everybody in america who makes a living and depends to some degree on export whether you are farmer manufacturer et cetera has an interest in the panama canal that is why the american people acted so fervently when jimmy carter gave away the panama canal they knew they knew even if they were not intellectualizing about it even if they did not have a complete intellectual or technical analysis of it they knew the panama canal was fundamental to our economic system and that is why they did not want it to go they probably were right because general noriega is tearing the country up in panama now we are going to have a very difficult time there but to go back to the gentlemans position the soviet military that is operating that is strategizing the policy for communist nicaragua realizes that when they complete the ports the naval bases at corinto and el bluff they will have a stranglehold over the panama canal in world war ii adolf hitler sunk more american tonnage at the panama canal

expended on needless placement in these institutions this valuable concept of care provides a serviceable answer to the needs of our health care system and offers a comforting dignified environment

support of the conference agreement on h r 3030 the agricultural credit act of 1987 as one of the conferees on this legislation ive seen the stepbystep progress on a farm credit package and after many months of review im pleased with the final product crafted by the house and senate agriculture committees in concert with the house committees on banking finance and urban affairs and on energy and commerce the conference agreement to h r 3030 represents a comprehensive plan to boost our ailing farm credit system as well as allow it to restore its longer term financial health built into this conference agreement is an incentive for the farm credit system to downsize itself to achieve lower operating costs and efficiencies in servicing borrowers the mergers of like and unlike entities will be based on stockholder votes giving borrowers an opportunity to help reshape existing entities into new institutions which are tailored to fit the needs of the local borrowers i was a strong supporter of the house version which mandated mergers of the existing 12 districts into no less than 6 however the approach set forth in the conference agreement is a positive alternative combining an immediate mandate for a merger of the federal land banks and federal intermediate credit banks with interdistrict mergers and association mergers dependent upon stockholder votes borrowers will benefit from the onestop shopping opportunity this creates for long and shorttointermediateterm loans the conference agreement also provides federal assistance to farm credit system entities to guarantee borrower stock a critical element of the package necessary to maintain confidence in the system government assistance in the form of 15year guaranteed bonds will be repaid by the system within 15 years this form of assistance should be the least costly to the federal government and should serve the purpose of helping the systemget back on its feet it will be metered c iii971 by the federal assistance corporation which is initially capitalized by the system districts like spokane will have assessments returned from past capital corporation and losssharing assessments before being evaluated for federal assistance this should offer some immediate relief to 12th district borrowers borrowers are protected by this agreement we included several provisions to protect borrowers rights and encourage farm credit system lending entities to work with borrowers to find the leastcost alternatives in troubled times im particularly pleased that this opens up communication between the farm credit system entities and their borrowers i did have some concerns about the inclusion of provisions affecting farmers home administration lending the conference agreement modifies many of the provisions contained in the house version and while it does not eliminate the constraints im worried about does make the requirements less costly i recognize the need in some areas for the creation of parallels between farmers home and the farm credit system finally i strongly support the secondary market created for farm real estate loans in this package fm an enthusiastic believer that this is an avenue to give increased access of farm lenders to capital markets which will turn step up competition in agricultural lending ultimately i think that the net effect will be lower interest rates to the benefit of borrowers and farm lending in general my point is that this package does not represent a quickfix solution to the farm credit systems problems it is a longterm plan laying out real changes in structure and practice in exchange for federal assistance we need to recognize that timely passage of this legislation is crucial to the farm credit systems financial health and longterm viability the farm credit system is ready to begin putting its financial house in order let us today show our support for and commitment to working with them to achieve this goal"],

repeat my admiration for the subcommittee chairman the gentleman from illinois and the entire appropriations committee i do not know how many times our group is going to have to repeat it but our quarrel is not with the appropriations committee the job its members have done is an admirable one under the conditions they have had to operate my quarrel is not with the budget committee although i would be the first one today after the vote yesterday to say that i regret my vote for the budget day before yesterday if i had to vote again today i would not vote for it because in hindsight considering the manner in which this debate is proceeding and the results of the voting i made one heck of a mistake and i admit that publicly on the record my quarrel today is with the 435 members of this house and that means that charlie stenholm is one four hundred thirtyfifth of the problem what we are about once again today is to make one small contribution to the amount of money that we do not have to borrow because i suspect the 276 colleagues of mine who voted to spend that extra 270 million that we do not have yesterday will not come forward and vote for the taxes to pay for it because it is much easier for us to vote to borrow that money for all the good and valid reasons that we have heard member after member say that we are not spending enough i suspect there will not be 218 of those 276 who will stand in this well and say i want to raise taxes on my constituents to pay for that 1 7 percent of the project that i had in my district yesterday today we are talking about the inter rior subcommittee and it is the same story this is 3 2 percent i have a project in this thanks to the generosity and the support of the subcommittee chairman the gentleman from illinois that is 167 000 dollars worth and with 3 percent that is 4 000 that i am asking this body to cut our problem again is with the entire process of this house and we are all a part of that problem and the bottom line is that we are heading into some real real deadlocks out there on which our ability to function as a house is going to be called into question because we are either going to have to borrow the money or raise the taxes to pay for it and this is one member who is serving notice that i in spite of my vote for the budget day before yesterday will not vote for one dime of taxes unless we can cut spending by this trivial amount of 1 7 percent and 3 2 percent here equalling 7 billion at the end of 13 of these exercises is that too much to ask there are those who say that under no circumstances will they compromise on taxes or anything and we are hearing that but i ask the members to see if we can find a spirit of compromise much like those 65 men did 200 years ago when they wrote the constitution that has allowed this great country to become what it is if we can find some middle ground in this case this group whatever you want to call us is saying let us make the budget effort work with an honest figure of 36 billion and to do that we have to cut 7 billion more in spending this is not an attack on the appropriations committee it is an attack on the 435 of us who do not always tend to be as honest with ourselves and in our rhetoric as we should be in the spirit of this house so i ask the members to vote for this amendment today and vote for each of the remaining 11 attempts to get that 7 billion we lost the battle yesterday but we did not lose the war if the president means what he says that one will come back if the senate means what it says that one will
