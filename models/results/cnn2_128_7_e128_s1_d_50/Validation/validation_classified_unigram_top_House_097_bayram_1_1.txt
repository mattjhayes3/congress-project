relief package a vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that chance under the congressional black caucus proposal your middle income constituents will fare far better in tax relief than under the kemprothreagan second and third year tax measures under our tax proposal the 96 percent of the people of this country who make 50 000 a year or less will have much more money in their pockets and in their pocketbooks gone in our proposal are last years windfall profits tax exemptions of 1 billion gone are the tax loopholes that gave excessive benefits to oil companies and to people who invested only in chinese and antiques and gold coins those features of the fauntroy substitute measured alone save us 10 billion in deficit spending a vote for the congressional black caucus is a vote to reduce taxes for 96 percent of the people of this country this is the peoples house and we ask you to give them a chance to receive what they want and what they need meaningful real tax relief the people of this country want relief from the enormous budget deficit that has resulted from last years tax giveaway to the rich and the gigantic increase in military spending of last year the people o this country now know that those large deficits mean continued high interest rates and thus continued small business and small farmer failures and continued high unemployment at record levels such as we have achieved in this past year the people of this countryand remember this is the peoples housewant a strong national defense but they do not want domination of the world they want an end to nuclear proliferation and your vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that they know with former secretary of the defense ielvin laird thatand i quote him our true strategic military needs have little to do with military weapons except to deter their use against us he points out that we must be able to keep open the sea and air links that bind us to our allies and that we need to be able to hold ground on the borders of europe and elsewhere and to protect and sustain power at great distance none of these objectives as i continue to quote former secretary of defense melvin laird none of these objectives requires nuclear weapons your vote for the fauntroy substitute will acknowledge that fact ii12689 the caucus budget also anwers a number of concerns raised by amendments offered for consideration under the rule today for those of you who have offered amendments to raise the cola caps in the jones budget for federal employees and retirees and to all of my colleagues who intend to support those amendments i say that a vote for the caucus amendment does just what you want the fauntroy substitute does not require such amendments since it incorporates the cbo baseline levels which preserve current service costofliving adjustments for federal pay and pensions a number of members have offered amendments to increase funding for function 500 education above the level recommended by the house budget committee the fauntroy substitute also as proposed raises funding for education above the house budget committee level and indeed it includes funding to restore programs to the present fiscal year 1982 reductions as passed in grammlatta let me now briefly outline the details of the congressional black caucus substitute before concluding my remarks you first ought to understand that the cbc budget reduces the deficit substantially in fact the congressional budget office has estimated that our budget will produce a 92 8 billion deficit in fiscal year 1983 which is lower by at least 10 billion than the deficit estimated by cbo for any other substitute and half the 183 billion deficit that will exist if nothing is done to rectify the errors of last years budget moreover our budget will lead to steadily shrinking deficits of 60 billion in fiscal year 1984 and a 18 billion surplus in fiscal year 1985 bringing interest rates down and providing the basis for genuine economic recovery in our country second you ought to know that the fauntroy substitute is fair and humane we not only prevent that many additional cuts in human needs programs as proposed by the president we return funds to social programs that were lost by the enactment of the reagan fiscal year 1982 budget reductions these programs must remain federal priorities if we value human potential and care to meet human needs because of savings generated by our alternative tax and defense policies several education health housing and urban programs can be restored to fiscal year 1981 funding levels adjusted for inflation for example the fauntroy substitute adds 3 3 billion to title i 600 million to pell grants for disadvantaged college students increasing funding for health care programs it adds 600 million in social services funding including child welfare programs and 1 billion more tlan reagan for pollution control it retains eda and the legal services corporation and lowincome energy and other conservation programs the third thing that this budget does is that it stimulates and creates jobs a centerpiece of our budget proposal is the creation of a major 6 billion to 8 billion federal jobs vocational education and training package this is a response to both the nations unemployment rate generally and to the catastrophic unempioyment in the black community specifically the fauntroy substitute also includes a 4 billion urban infrastructure proposal which will create 50 000 to 80 000 jobs directly and more indirectly a 4 billion expansion in mass transit and highway construction programs which will create an equal number of jobs in this country it also includes home ownership assistance and rental housing construction programs that will stimulate employment in residential construction finally the budget insures adequate social security and other support for the nations poor both the elderly and the nonelderly this budget maintains the costofliving adjustment for elderly on fixed incomes and expands unemployment compensation benefits at a time when we have 10 3 million people out of work the program triggers in the caucus budget increase eligibility for the unemployed to 52 weeks in our view this restoration of benefits is necessary at a time when we are experiencing the levels of unemployment which have not been endured since the depression our budget also provides increased funding for other programs to assist the poor including 3 2 billion more than reagan for aid to families with dependent children 5 billion more for food stamps 3 billion more for medicaid and medicare 1 2 billion more for six health programs and 400 million more for supplemental social insurance as my colleagues in the congressional black caucus follow me they will give you more details about the caucus budget resolution i simply want to remind you again that this is the peoples house and we ought to give the people the life support programs that will cushion them through these difficult times we need to give 96 percent of the people of this country the kird of tax relief that we have pr45mised in the generalized language about tax relief for all of the people we need to give the people relief from the enormous deficits and the high interest rates that have robbed the people of this country of homes and farms small businesses and 2 5 million jobs just since july of last year a vote for the fauntroy substitute the economic recovery program of the congressional black caucus will do just that at this time i would

act the main purpose of this bill is to authorize federal agencies to contract with private debt collection agencies in order to collect delinquent federal debts my colleagues are already aware of the massive debts owed to the federal government and of the enormous amount of this debt that is delinquent mismanagement on the part of bureacrats has permitted these delinquent debts to accumulate the details of the problem are described in the recently issued report of the office of management and budget debt collection project on may 18 1981 the house passed h r 2811 a bill designed to help agencies manage their debts in a more businesslike fashion and to make agency debt collection activities more effective that bill was only one step in the effort to improve debt collection practices and to increase the revenue from delinquent debts because agencies have such a poor track record in managing their debts we must recognize that there may be times when agencies need assistance that is what the bill i have introduced today will do it will authorize and regulate the use of private debt collection agencies by the federal government i hope that use of private debt collectors in appropriate circumstances will increase the repayment of debts owed to the federal government i am convinced that use of these private collectors can be done in a way that is consistent with the right to privacy the rules that govern the contracting out of government functions and the laws that regulate debt collection practices this bill is necessary because it is not clear under present law that agencies have the authority to enter into contracts for debt collection services for many years the general accounting office took the position that federal agencies could not legally delegate the debt collection function to private contractors in order to overcome this restriction congress found it necessary to expressly authorize the use of private debt collectors for a specific category of debts in the education amendments of 1976 public law 94482 i was surprised when the general accounting office and the department of justice reversed this interpretation and amended the regulations for the federal claims collection act the amended regulations require agencies to consider contracting for debt collection services this rule change appeared in the federal register for april 17 1981 no adequate reason for the shift in legal position was cited by the general accounting office and the justice department in the explanation that accompanied the rule change i asked the congressional research service to take a look at the issue of the legality of contracting our for debt collection services crs found no clear legal explanation for the change in the opinion of the general accounting office and the justice department it seems to me that if an activity was once considered to violate federal law then it takes a legislative change in order to make that activity legal

the feeling of congress that this country required a sound piece of legislation which would eliminate voter discrimination when congress passed this bill many of our citizens praised it as one of the most significant pieces of clvil rights legislation in the history of our country now the act is again before congress for reauthorization although we in this country have made great strides in ridding our land of this form of discrimination it is clear that this statute has not outlived its usefulness there is still racial and language discrimination in this country there is still dissatisfaction and unrest and according to a study made by the unitedstates commission on civil rights we still need the voting rights act although this legislation has been effective its accomplishments are fragile we must continue to protect the rights of our minorities in 1965 minorities simply did not enter our political system in 1965 our minorities were virtually disenfranchised from free participation in our political system although the conmmission on civil rights found that substantial progress had been made as a result of this act the commission also found that persistent and serious obstacles to complete participation in our political processes still remain the fact is that minorities continue to constitute a small percentage of elected officials despite increased political participation by minorities in many areas of the country the fact is that minorities continue to face a variety of problems that this act was designed to overcome the commissions report has documented white resistance and hostility by some state and local officials officials who are hostile to increased minority participation in almost every aspect of the voting process the fact is that there are still some areas where locai jurisdictions do not believe in equality before the law there are still some areas of this country where local jurisdictions violate either the letter or the spirit of the lawor both in many ways we in this country are lucky poll taxes and literacyr tests are no longer a requirement of participation in the voting process but the facts are very clear if we do not extend this act we willgive reluctant localities avenues of opportunity to use very sophisticated ways of disenfranchising the minority voter if we do not extend this act a municipality could certainly redistrict or annex a surrounding suburban area to dlute minority voting power or a municipality could very easily change public offices from elected to appointed seats indeed the opportunities for violating both the spirit and letter of the law are virtually limitless we need to extend the voting rights act for the sake of what has happened to the minorities in this country in the post and to protect them from what may happen in the future it is not enough to say that we have made great strides in the area of minority discrimination and simply leave it at that we are not a stagnant nation our demography is constantly changing in fact the demlography of this nation has changed more since 1965 than it has in 50 years for the last two decades we have opened our arms to the worlds homeless we have given shelter to men and women fleeing economic oppression and political persecution more often than not these immigrants and refugees run the risk of being politically disenfranchised the rights of all citizens regardless of where they live or their nation of origin must be protected for that is precisely what a democracy is all about the voting rights act of 1965 has been hailed as the most important civil rights bill enacted by congress without doubt it has been the most effective tool for protecting the right to vote in this country and as such we owe it to ourselves to grant this tool another 2 years of life because this act provides evidence of this nations commitment to assure that none of its citizens are deprived of the basic right guaranteed by

jersey and wish to associate myself with the laudatory remarks of the previous speaker and i want to indicate to this body that it has been an edifying and wonderful experience for me to sit upon the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights chaired by the gentleman from california it was an interesting experience and one which made clear to me that the kind of expertise he displays in marshaling witnesses and testimony was in accord with tl~e highest standards of this congress i tal~e my point of departure in this discussion as did the previous speaker the distinguished gentleman from illinois from the 15th amendment with emphasis upon that section which says that the states shall not deny or abridge the rights of the freedom to vote h r 3112 extending the voting rights act of 1965 is a simple extension which puts meat and gusto and verve to that long languishing 15th amendment i do not think we can look at the 15th amendment in a void i think it has to be put into historical context in the historic continuum if we look at it in a void we may forget that this country has over the past 100 or more years been steadily impelled in the direction of an ever extending franchise to guarantee every adult the untrampled inviolate right to vote that is what this debate is all about the question is whether this congress will continue in its pristine powerful form the act which after a 100 years of delay was finally designed to do something about the right of blacks and hispanics in this country to vote when we look at it in a historical context it takes on more meaning i think we can trace it for example to the direct election of senators in these united states we can take our point of departure from the 19th amendment and the sufferage for women we can look at the other aspects of that continuum the constant fight to remove certain impediments to the black mans right to vote in the south such things as a grandfather clause knocked down by various courts we can look at the 24th amendment and the elimination of the poll tax as part of an exorable march to expand the franchise in this country the 18yearold vote carried it forward as did the oneman onevote decision of the supreme court in the sixties and finally the civil rights act of 1965 so we can see that this countrys objective has always been to protect the right to vote as an individual when people stand here and say this is punishment to the south or punishment to the covered jurisdictions or an impingement upon their sovereignty or a holding of them in hostage they are not looking at the 15th amendment and they are certainly not looking at the history of this country a history which has made it very clear that every adult citizen should have the right to vote the registration figures indicate quite clearly that this act has ben successful for example in the covered jurisdictions primarily in the south the registration figures have gone up from about 20 percent to approximately 50 percent the number of black elected officials in covered jurisdictions in the south has gone up from approximately 100 to around 2 000 section 5 the preclearance section has therefore been a strong and powerful mechanism whereby devices designed to dilute the vote in the south have been removed there are some who say that since it has been such a singular success perhaps the time has arrived to abandon it obviously and clearly that is not true any one who had been privy to the hearings we had throughout this country in which we saw scores of witnesses at 18 hearings would certainly come to the conclusion as i have done that not only should the a~t be extended but also that no mechanism should dilute it in any meaningful fashion we heard prominent litigators before us on both sides of the question civil rights organization leaders state officials secretaries of state attorneys general former and present congressmen those who had been involved in the initial 1965 act and those here sitting in the house today black and white state assemblymen from throughout the south appeared before us grassroots people academicians but there was an overwhelming positive support for the extension of section 5 preclearance the weight of the testimony was simply astounding the gentleman from illinois is not diminishing the potency of that evidence when he says that the weight of the testimony was so overwhelming that it turned him around he had been against to a certain extent the extension of that act the witnesses before us gave us a chamber of horrors instance after instance in which the act had been violated there had been intimidation threats coercion poll changes with no notice individuals in the south forced to vote at an open table where everyone could see them and intimidation was rampant objections have been filed to approximately almost 300 of these various changes in the south the civil rights commission stated that over 500 changes made in covered jurisdictions were not submitted to the attorney general racial gerrymandering was rampant in many many jurisdictions through the south and annexations designed to threaten black strength were

president for fiscal year 1983 i must admit that i was surprised at the authorization level reeommended by the science research and technology subcommittee and then approved by our full science and technology committee i was surprised because at a tinie when most agencies are being asked to take significant budget reductions nsf was granted a 7 7percent increase this year over last years budget the coinmittees recommendation comes in far above that generous increaseadding an additional 30 million to the authorization last year there were strong differences on both sides of the aisle as to the appropriate level of funding for the foundation given the size of the increase over last years funding however and given the size of the problems we are facing on the national level due to overspending i do not believe a valid case can be made for increasing this budget 30 million over the presidents request let me address one area in particular in the admin strations request that is of great concern to many members myself included that area is science and engineering education the administration has requested 15 million in fiscal year 1983 for graduate research fellowships the committee has seen fit to add 30 million to this category applying it to a variety of education programs at different levels pther than graduate education i do not believe that there is any question that science education at all levels but particularly at the elementary and secondary levels is facing severe problems however i think the committee has taken an approach that has become all too common in an attempt to solve problems and that is to just throw more money at it before embarking on a major expenditure of funds in this area the administration has chosen wisely i think to move more cautiously in a search for solutions to these problems they have established the national science board commission on precollege education in mathematics science and technology the commission will be active over a period of 18 months and is expected to issue interim reports on its findings at 6month intervals included in the scope of its activities will be an examination of existing evidence on the quality of general and preprofessional secondary school education in mathematics and science since it is my belief that precollege education is fundamentally a responsibility of state and local governments the use of this commission to identify solutions without involving the federal government to the tune of millions of dollars is a wise approach the commission will be able to identify ways for all of the concerned communities across this natioi to work together in addressing the problems of math and science education in our secondary schools i am certainly not foreclosing the possibility of additional federal aid at some point in the future but we should certainly not make prejudgments until all the facts are in the administrations budget as contained in my amendment reflects this approach what we are confronting here today on this nsf authorization is a situation very similar to the one that we saw last week on the nasa authorization and in that instance we had an authorization that was an increase of some 11 percent over last year however the majority on the committee added additional moneys to that authorization here today on the national science foundation authorization we once again have a very generous increase on the part of the administration for fiscal 1983 compared to the amount approved in the continuing resolution for fiscal year 1982 the increase for the next fiscal year is approximately 73 million or a hike of roughly 7 7 percent the committee chose to add 30 million to this budget primarily in the education areas without making any corresponding decreases to keep the budget at a reasonable level this approach is just not consistent with our drive to right the economy bring the deficit down and establish a workable and fiscally responsible national budget i believe that the administrations request for the national science foundation is fiscally sound wellbalanced and would maximize the benefits from the nations

is going on now than i have been since those sort of private times when i tried to influence policy decisions on the korean war and the vietnam war incidentally i was virtually never successful i am terribly worried about this performance because i have as the members will see as i try to explain what i am saying the deepest respect for two of the people who are heavily involved in this first i am very sad that this is happening this way and i say this not with any lack of sympathy for the republican members of the house i have witnessed the same kind of thing going on the democratic side particularly when lyndon johnson was the president when the white house presumed to take over the whole process i do not mean to be unkind to anybody on the republican side but it is very clear that the timing especially with regard to the great push to bring up this particular matter at this particular time was masterminded by the white house and perhaps some members of the house that i do not know but certainly not the leadership in such a way that it would have an overwhelming political smell i am not sensitive about politics you know i know about it and i have played legislative politics as well as substantive politics most of my career but this is really an extraordinary example it is an example of a party that had had a very strong program which went astray and then the party had the good sense to modify it somewhat that has happened in the last roughly 20 months i guess it is i am not going to go into any detail but it is very hardit is very very hardto come to a conclusion any other conclusion than that the timing on this is a diversion i would not be worried about it if the principal actors in this were only the president and jim baker and ed meese and the other white house operators the only sad thing about it is that a man whom i admire enormously and think would make a quite good prestdentand i hope i am not hurting him when i say thishas apparently been the hit man on this the vice president i hope that is not true i hope it is the others because i have come to expect that from them even including lyndon johnson and richard nixon this is the most political white house i have ever dealt with it is so much a politicalwhite house that it sort of frightens me because it does remind me of a combination of johnson and nixon and if that does not fnghten people we have a problem that is why i am sad and i am quite serious about this i have great admiration for the republican party and many of its members i am also sad because one of my best friends on the republican side of the aisle and one of the men i admire the most is the author of the base resolution i have a strong feeling that i understand why he is in that position he just got so fed up with the democrats that he thought anything was better than what they were doing and i do not even blame him from his point of view it makes sensenot from my point of view i have almost gotten in that situation a couple of times and never quite made it but i do not belong to his party i am not trying to be funny i am telling you why i am concerned but the bottom line of why i am concerned is the substance the gentleman from new york crafted the best possible bad resolution and the fundamental thing that is wrong with that resolution is that it demonstrates that he has truly given up on the essential democratic process he puts certain things in his resolutioneven though much more wisely drafted than most of the ones i have seen and many of those resolutions have been created by democratswhich would require supermajorities to decide that there will be an unbalanced budget some very estimable people on the republican side again whom i admire have made the point that we already have a supermajority that we have a supermajority in the twothirds required to override a veto but dear god does not anybody understand that in a government cleverly and carefully crafted to separate the powers so that no one power would become the tyrant that the veto override process is the great clash in the american political process between a convinced executive and a convinced congress that simple twothirds requirement is the only one and here we are not talking thank god and thank mr conable about anything quite as bad as a twothirds supermajority i can bring this rule to the floor only because i am convinced that it is the best rule we could possibly have for a completely outrageous situation that should never come up at this time in the flow of congress there can be all kinds of arguments made that the democrats prevented it from coming up any other time that is simply not true if the big five were going to put the heat on people some of whom are directly opposed to this proposition they could have done it earlier if they had really wanted to generate the steamand they did generate the steamit could have been done practically anytime even earlier this year now what is political about this it is inescapable to me that it is a diversion it is inescapable to me that the timing is a diversion the substance is not but the timing is a diversion now why is it upsetting me why am i worried my worry is very minor it has to do with me i am worried that i will not present this as well as it could be presented i am upset because i fear we are going to do grave damage to the republic and its processes i have been one of the earliest people to recognize that we must have a responsible process a budget process that gives us a rational approach i have been defeated by my party on occasions by both parties on occasion in seeking that opportunity the bill that we have been operating under for a number of years i crafted to a large degree and when i presented it to the house which voted virtually unanimously for it i tried to make it clear that it was not a very good bill that it needed a lot of change and that its future depended entirely on the will of the membership one of the tragedies of our time has been that in this institution we were unable to achieve what was achieved in the senate until very recently the budget resolutions have been a totally partisan matter i have no intention of trying to lay the blame for that there cannot be a partisan budget approach many of the democrats have never understood this what you do in your fight over a budget resolution is fight out the alternatives and come to a conclusion and then if you really believe in a budget process you have some responsibility that it functions and even if you do not win you need to vote for the process that may be a strange idea to some of you who have never looked at process as being that complicated and that restrictive but that is the way you are going to deal with these major problems if you ever do there are a lot of democrats who need to learn this lesson that we must have the process if we do not have a process which deals with the macroeconomic situation in the united states we will revert to the boom and bust of the period prior to world war ii administrations of great variety for years gave us a relatively steady approach to macroeconomic problems it is something that has to be done and it has to be done by this institution along with others we are dealing with the greatest single issue that faces the society the free world and all the democratic countries because none of them even the parliamentary ones have successfully dealt with it in this approach to using the constitution as the vehicle we crush the proper approach which is that we must have the will to pass legislation that will deal with economic problems and then we have the character the courage and the wisdom to deal with it in a bipartisan fashion i do not believe there is any future for this country literally if we think that one point of view by itself can prevail i do not think the democratic party by itself can prevail with the policies that we must have i do not believe that the republican party can prevail with its policies alone i am deeply committed to the notion that the only way we can function together and survive together is by coalitions of the

that made us live very well i think this is exactly the wrong way to go and i think we should defeat all the proposals for a constitutional amendment i think then we should return to an effort to see

yield myself such time as i may consume as the house of representatives begins debate on the budget our nation faces two indivisible crises one is economics and the other is social neither will be solved independently of the other both must be addressed or we will shed the ties that bind our people together turning class against class and destroying the vitality of our free enterprise system what is at stake is the economy itself and what is the state of the economy mr chairman unemployment stood at 7 3 percent just 1 year ago when we debated this budget today it is at 9 4 percent and reagan administration spokesmen expect it to soar past 10 percent one year ago mortgage rates stood at 15 percent today that mortgage is 17 4 percent and millions of american families have been priced out of the market for a home as a result new housing starts have fallen 40 percent business failures are running 49 percent above 1981 our gross national product is expected to decline actually decline in 1982 farm income has fallen 39 percent and the savings and loan industry is likely to lose 6 billion this year alone black unemployment stands at 18 4 percent one out of every five black persons cannot find a job the economic program put in place 1 year ago has failed it has failed to meet the standards the republican administration set for its own program had that program succeeded i can assure my colleagues this debate would not have taken place today but the program has failed to meet its own test of performance a year ago kemproth reaganomics was a promise without a past today reaganomics is a reality with a record a record of broken promises it is a program which must be changed even the president himself has acknowledged by offering to raise federal taxes 122 billion over the next 3 years that his program must be the administration budget put before the congress in february has been abandoned that is not even a part of this debate all of the remaining budgets before this house recognize that the economic program put in place last year must be significantly altered in many ways the most peculiar thing about the debate this year is the similarity of the deficits proposed by the various alternatives in fact there is almost no difference in the deficit proposed by the republican substitute and the budget offered by the house budget committee but in terms of the other national crisis the social crisis the difference between the republican budget and that of the budget committee is vast indeed in a time of record unemployment the republican alternatives prime aim appears to be to protect the tax cut for the rich to do that they are willing to crush the programs for the old the young the poor the hungry and the handicapped they propose to buy every dream weapon of every general without regard to efficiency or to mission the republican substitute is a budget which ignores the legitimate needs of the average american in order to protect the rich should such a policy be allowed to continue we will cease to be a society defined by a vast mobile middle class we will become a society of conflict between the poor who have lost hope and the rich protected by law nothing absolutely nothing could be more dangerous or more damaging to the preservation of order at home and the strength to provide security from foes abroad let me stress one point here because there is going to be a lot of discussion on the defense budget no one in any of the substitutes in any of the proposals no one proposes cutting national security or defense the only question before the house is how much are we going to increase the defense budget what we in the budget committee propose is to increase in real terms the defense budget by 5 percent that includes a 4percent raise in pay which i would hope would be dedicated to those ranks and grades which most need an increase i think that higher paid officers like affluent people in all parts of our shntry should be willing to sacrifice a little bit but with the 4percent raise in salaries the actual increase in the nonpay part of the defense bldget under the budget committee proposal is approximately 9 percent after adjusting for inflation a real growth of about 9 percent nor is this a battle between spenders and savers when we discuss these budget alternatives both the republican and the democratic proposal makes significant savings in fact you can chart out the 3year program of the committee bill versus the republican substitute and the deficits are actually lowered more under the budget committee resolution this is a debate which will be decided by members who must make a series of difficult choices there are no easy solutions to the problems we face i have said many times that the debate today has no first choices for political people all of the choices are second choices at best third fourth and fifth choices more likely but that is what is necessary if we are going to get this fiscal policy under control that is the issue before the house today it is absolutely essential that a budget be passed whether you are a republican or a democrat the very worst signal we could send to this country is that we are unable to come to grips with fiscal policy if we send a signal that we cannot pass the budget resolution and implement it i think that such failure could lead to economic catastrophe so it is essential that a budget be passed but it must be passed in a way that preserves the social fabric of our nation at the conclusion of this debate the house will decide i believe that the house can only decide that the house budget committee resolution is the budget that best meets the dual tests of fairness and effectiveness and provides the best solution to the dual

minnesota mr oberstar i am introducing a bill to increase the excise tax on cigarettes by 10 cents and to transfer the revenues from this tax to medicare on the senate side senator danforth has introduced identical legislation s 1610 a major objective of this bill is to help make those who choose to smoke responsible for the tremendous health care costs now borne for them by the federal government and the nonsmoking taxpayers experts estimate that in 1980 alone a staggering 3 8 billion or about 6 percent of medicare and medicaid expenditures went to treat persons suffering from smokingrelated diseases presently the federal excise tax of 8 cents per package first imposed in 1951 and left unchanged in the intervening 30 years goes into the general treasury thus the current 8cent tax revenue is only very indirectly being applied to the costs attributable directly to cigarette smoking if the additional 10cent tax is earmarked to medicare however this would raise over 3 billion per year for medicare a 10cent excise tax increase would also help decrease cigarette consumption reducing consumption would benefit not only the health of americans but also our troubled economy considering that the value of production lost through sickness due to smoking in 1980 was 25 8 billion an increase in the excise tax on cigarettes would help productivity while proposing tax increases is not popular i believe that in this case it is altogether warranted and timely my bill makes smokers pay a larger share of the clearly identified costs they impose on society and it also brings needed financial help to a very troubled social security system this bill is not a way for president reagan to avoid responsibility for projected deficits exceeding 100 billion in the coming years the president must recognize that future deficits were largely created by the excessive 749 billion tax cut he pushed through congress last year my bill is however a way of dealing with a national health disaster created by cigarette smoking i hope that my colleagues on the ways and means committee will thoughtfully consider this legislation in the near future e"],
