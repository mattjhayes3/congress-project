americans out in the cold the budget slashed domestic programs for education health care and veterans health benefits in order to make room for more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans i voted against it because i thought it left out the needs of the middle class and working families and would hurt my constituents in my hometown of sacramento today we are considering the conference agreement to that budget which has been negotiated in secret over the past several weeks and rushed to the floor without time for members to even read through it but it appears that these several weeks have not yielded many improvements the cuts to the most vulnerable are still there the cuts to education are still there and it still favors big oil companies at the expense of our natural treasures by allowing drilling in anwr more fundamentally this is a budget agreement without courage during president clintons administration congress took up the hard work involved in weighing our nations competing priorities and it meant that we were able to create a social security surplus for future generations in a very responsible manner but it has been just the opposite under this republican majority they are spending every dollar of the social security surplus in order to finance their april 28 2005 cc deficits and their tax breaks for the wealthiest of americans just as irresponsibly this budget is trying to hide the presidents plan to privatize social security the president wants to divert social security payroll taxes out of the social security system and into private accounts replacing a guaranteed benefit with the risks of wall street is bad public policy it would mean an average benefit reduction of 152 000 it is not surprising that the american people have rejected it we should be strengthening social securitys fundamental commitment made from one generation to another instead of weakening it conveniently the budget agreement before us ducks responsibility for this reckless plan we know that privatizing social security would require borrowing 2 trillion over the next 10 years debt borrowed against our children and our grandchildren not surprisingly this inconvenient reality is left out of the conference report the budget is our federal governments statement of priorities crafting it involves tough choices among many competing and worthwhile programs nonetheless democratic priorities are clear making health care more affordable strengthening social security investing in our local communities i do not believe this budget has these priorities in mind and i urge my colleagues to vote against this misguided agreement"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise today to express my opposition to the presidents fy06 budgeta budget that i believe goes against our values as a society if the proposed budget passes it would be a disaster for constituents in my home district on long island and districts nationwide forcing working families to make up for many of the cuts in the form of higher state and local taxes the american people deserve honesty and this budget is dishonest by omission and dishonest in how it portrays the overall budget projections the president claims that the steep budget cuts he advocates are necessary to cut the deficit in half in 5 years this is simply not true and the budget the president proposes fails to accomplish his stated goal first the budget is dishonest by omission nowhere in the fy06 budget does the president account for significant costs including fails to account for the enormous costs of privatizing social security as proposed by the president a whopping 6 trillion over the next 20 years 754 billion over the period from 20092015 fails to account for the continuing presence of our troops in iraqthe administration knows we are going to approve an iraq supplemental upward of 80 billion for the first part of this year aloneand an estimated 384 billion over 10 yearsyet still omits it in the budget fails to account for growth in interest costs fails to reform the alternative minimum tax that is disproportionately burdening middle income families in my district on long island as troubling as the glaring budget omissions is the knowledge that the deficit is largely a selfinflicted wound the president inherited a record annual surplus of 236 billionwhich now 4 years later has tanked into a deficit in excess of 400 billion any attempt at honest accounting suggests that we are looking at a decade or more of similar deficits the reason we are faced with an unethical budget is because the president refuses to acknowledge the fiscal irresponsibility of his choices and will not entertain even the most moderate suggestions such as repealing only the portion of the tax cuts that benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers unfortunately this budget builds on a disturbing trend this administration and the leadership in congress appear to be intent on valuing wealth over work thereby placing working families at a distinct disadvantage the tax policies the president advocates disproportionately advantage the wealthiest to the detriment of working americans and working families will continue to bear the brunt of the rising inflation spurred by the rising interest rates the bill gates of the world pocketed their tax cut at the insistence of the president however this president sees no problem eliminating funding for perkins loans in his budget even though the cost of tuition is rising and will continue to rise as the administrations policies force inflation as a result of the decision to eliminate perkins this year more than 670 000 student borrowers could lose out on loan forgiveness if they become teachers law enforcement officers or if they serve in the military this is just one of many examples of valuing wealth over work in my district the budget scales back and eliminates several longterm shore protection projects important to the safety and economic security of long island the president has no problem zeroing out the fire island to montauk point study just as it nears completion the president eliminates funding to dredge the patchogue river even though this creates a huge safety hazard for boaters the president does not hesitate to slash funding for the long island sound study office from 7 million to less than 500 000 even though this is vital to the livelihoods and economy of the east end of long island the president falls far short of his promise under the no child left behind bill even though this means that taxpayers will have to foot the bill at the local level to pay for education finally the president does not seem to mind taxing veterans health care at 250 per year and doubling copayments for veterans prescription drugs at a time when we should be saluting our veterans our values as a society are not reflected in this budget we must ban together in congress to force an honest accounting and insist upon the

better than the world you and i inherited of late i think congress has forgotten that when i compare the laundry list of items important to my constituents and the american people to what congress is doing a disconnect is apparent an overwhelming majority of americans think it is long past due to increase the minimum wage over the past 6 years this congress has done little if anything to help those earning the minimum wage and the families who depend on them the buying power of the minimum wage is now at its lowest point in 57 years at the sara4 time the cost of key necessities like health care education and gas have been rising faster than inflation yet during the past 8 years members of congress have raised their own pay seven times by nearly 30 000 in those same years minimumwage workers have not gotten a single raise they continde to earn an average of 10 700 a year raising the minimum wage is a real tangible policy decision to significantly help 7 5 million americans who this congress has virtually ignored we can make this choice only by allowing an upordown vote on congressman millers bipartisan bill this bill would gradually raise the minimum wage from 5 15 an hour to 7 25 an hour since february nearly 200 members have signed the petition that would force and upordown vote on this measure and that is what we should have today the only reason we have not had a vote on it is because of the republican leadership they resisted the will of the american people and a bipartisan coalition of members and now that the minimum wage increase will finally be debated by the house it has once again been loaded down with poison pills if the republican leadership really cared about raising the minimum wage they would not have waited until the eleventh hour before the house leaves for recess this is a transparent electionyear ploy i am confident the american people will see it for what it is when a party holds three votes to roll back the estate tax but refuses to allow a clean vote on the minimum wage it is clear where its priorities are while raising the minimum wage will help millions of americans the estate measure will primarily benefit just 7 500 families looking at the majoritys record we should not be surprised there is the series of tax cuts that benefit the wealthiest among us the massively flawed medicare prescription drug benefit and subsidies for oil and gas companies but for those in the middle class and working families there is not much to talk about nothing to help get access to decent health care or build on the promise of stem cell research or lower the price of gas or make college more affordable at the end of today the majority certainly cannot claim to have made a good faith effort to raise the minimum wage and that is truly

always excellent leadership on behalf of the middleclass working families in america i salute him for his excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford

veterans benefits and other programs that improve the quality of life for rhode islands working families unfortunately these responsible ideas were cast aside in favor of the republican values we have

into debt h con res 95 also contains vast cuts to programs that benefit the working class most troubling is a 10 billion cut to medicaid which will place an enormous burden on rhode island my state has successfully leveraged federal medicaid dollars and currently offers health care coverage to many vulnerable lowincome pregnant women parents of young children and other groups not included in the federal mandate without sufficient medicaid funding these people would likely join the increasing ranks of the uninsured in addition this budget implements a multitude of other cuts proposed by the

priorities of the american people the republican blueprint does not make us safer or healthier prepare children for the future or honor veterans by continuing failed tax policies while cuffing

plus an extra 160 billion when interest is accounted for only 0 5 percent of the richest families in america currently pay estate taxes moreover under current law in 2009 only 3 out of every 1 000

as h r 5638is therefore crafted entirely to benefit this tiny sliver of the richest estates american voters stand strongly against drastic estate tax legislation according to recent polling data nearly 60 percent of voters hold the initial unaided view that estate tax should be left as is or reformed and only 23 percent support repeal when asked about the estate tax in the context of other budget priorities voters rank repealing the estate tax as the last priority and 55 percent of voters oppose repeal this socalled compromise nearly as regressive and costly as a full repeal is no compromise at all passing even this compromise legislation would constitute one of the most regressive tax cuts in the history of the united states middle and lowerclass americans will be forced to shoulder the burden of radically decreasing the estate taxboth monetarily and through decreased public programs in order to cover the monetary gap the government will plunge further into debt which will limit its ability to address the social security solvency gap and reduce the money available for public programs it will also have to tap other tax sources like payroll taxes which will overwhelmingly hinder lowerincome families i urge my colleagues to uphold the core american values of fairness and belief in meritocracy by rejecting this tax cut if we really wish to help the most deserving american families we should raise the minimum wage from 5 15 to 7 25 over 3 years did you know that todays minimum wage of 5 15 today is the equivalent of only 4 23 in 1995 which is even lower than the 4 25 minimum wage level before the 199697 increase it is scandalous that a person can work fulltime 40 hours per week for 52 weeks earning the minimum wage would gross just 10 700 which is well below the poverty line a minimum wage increase would raise the wages of millions of workers an estimated 7 3 million workers 5 8 percent of the workforce would receive an increase in their hourly wage rate if the minimum wage was raised from 5 15 to 7 25 by june 2007 due to spillover effects the 8 2 milli6n workers 6 5 percent of the workforce earning up to 1 00 above the minimum would also be likely to benefit from an increase raising the minimum viage will benefit working families the earnings of minimum wage workers are crucial to their families wellbeing evidence from the 199697 minimum wage increase shows that the average minimum wage worker brings home more than half 54 percent of his or her familys weekly earnings an estimated 760 000 single mothers with children under 18 would benefit from a minimum wage increase to 7 25 by june 2007 single mothers would benefit disproportionately from an increasesingle mothers are 10 4 percent of workers affected by an increase but they make up only 5 3 percent of the overall workforce approximately 1 8 million parents with children under 18 would benefit contrary to popular myths and urban legends adults make up the largest share of workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase seventytwo percent of workers whose wages would be raised by a minimum wage increase to 7 25 by june 2007 are adults age 20 or older close to half 43 9 percent of workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase work full time and another third 34 5 percent work between 20 and 34 hours per week minimum wage increases benefit disadvantaged workers and women are the largest group of beneficiaries from a minimum wage increase 60 6 percent of workers who would benefit from an increase to 7 25 by 2007 are women an estimated 7 3 percent of working women would benefit directly from that increase in the minimum wage a disproportionate share of minorities would benefit from a minimum wage increase african americans represent 11 1 percent of the total workforce but are 15 3 percent of workers affected by an increase similarly 13 4 percent of the total workforce is hispanic but hispanics are 19 7 percent of workers affected by an increase the benefits of the increase disproportionately help those working households at the bottom of the income scale although households in the bottom 20 percent received only 5 1 percent of

average half of the familys earnings thirtysix percent of such workers actually contribute 100 percent of their familys earnings a minimum wage increase would help reverse the trend of declining real wages for lowwage workers between 1979 and 1989 the minimum wage lost 31 percent of its real value by contrast between 1989 and 1997 the year of the most recent increase the minimum wage was raised four times and recovered about onethird of the value it lost in the 1980s income inequality has been increasing in part because of the declining real value of the minimumwage today the minimum wage is 33 percent of the average hourly wage of american workers the lowest level since 1949 a minimum wage increase is part of a broad strategy to end poverty as welfare reform forces more poor families to rely on their eamings from lowpaying jobs a minimum wage increase is likely to have a greater impact on reducing poverty the opponents of the minimum wage often claim that increasing the wage will cost jobs and harm the economy of course there is no credible study to support such claims in fact a 1998 epi study failed to find any systematic significant job loss associated with the 199697 minimum wage increase the truth is that following the most recent increase in the minimum wage in 199697 the lowwage labor market performed better than it had in decades and after the minimum wage was increased the country went on to enjoy the most sustained period of economic prosperity in history we had historic low levels of unemployment rates increased average houriy wages increased family income and decreased poverty rates studies have shown that the best performing small businesses are located in states with the highest minimum wages between 1998 and 2004 the job growth for small businesses in states with a minimum wage higher than the federal level was 6 2 percent compared to a 4 1 percent growth in states where the federal level prevailed so much for the discredited notion

in nevadas richest county 61 5 percent of douglas where bush received 63 5 percent of the vote voters supported raising the minimum wage fortythree percent of americans consider raising the minimum wage to be a top priority in contrast only 34 percent considered making the recent federal income tax cuts permanent and only 27 percent consider the passage of a constitutional amendment to ban samesex marriage as top priorities members of congress have legislated a minimum salary for themselves and have seen fit to raise it eight times since they last raised the minimum wage it is time we gave the americans we represent a longoverdue pay raise by increasing the minimum wage to 7 25 over 3 years even this amount does not keep pace with the cost of living the minimum wage would have to

federal income tax code whether it is individually or corporations or other businesses any system that is based on a fair concept is flawed because what is fair to one per sons view is not necessarily fair to somebody elses point of view when you base a public policy this broad and expansive and quite frankly invasive on fairness then you set yourself up for a constant argument and constant battle about what is and is not fair clearly your chart shows a differential between the wealthiest folks in this country and the folks that are on their way up to hopefully becoming the wealthiest in this country certainly they have got that opportunity with hard work and applying themselves to that so i would just like to point out that maybe we need a different system maybe sometime next year let us have this conversation about a different way to collect the minimum amount of money needed to fund this federal government and we will have that conversation i would like to comment though on health care and individual responsibility i think it is universally recognized and that is a hard thing to state with a straight face but i think it is universally recognized that americans enjoy the finest health care delivery system in the world you yourself have been an integral part of that as an orthopedic surgeon and your wife i believe is an anesthesiologist members of the delivery system that this country enjoys we have got a flawed payment system and i am not sure how we got to this point and place but we are here we have got a system that if you ran your car insurance program the same way we run health insurance then each time you needed to change the oil in your car or new tires you would file an insurance claim that is not how we work our cars we figure out a way to operate our automobiles out of our normal monthly budget we budget for that and take care of those incidentals we do have car insurance for the catastrophes for wrecks for destruction and theft those kinds of things those catastrophic deals our health care system is flawed in that quite frankly i get the services you provide me the services and someone else pays for those services in that scheme i am not as concerned about the cost of those services as i ought to be because i am not writing a check to help out with that so i have no incentives so to speak to ask you are there alternatives to what you have proposed is there another way to do this or cheaper way can we do it at some other hospital that can be a little less expensive than the one you typically practice at because i am writing those checks getting personal responsibility back into the health care system getting a system in which i have a viable interest in asking that question we may ask that question on every other single thing that we do how much is that going to cost we may not ask it out loud but we make a costbenefit analysis each time in our head each time we make a purchase on something such as how do i want to pay for that we do not do that in medicine and it needs to be communicated to all of us that that is okay to do in medicine there are some things in medicine you do not ask emergency or catastrophic kinds of things you go get that thing there is an awful lot of medicine that i think is subject to a circumstance where we can ask what that costs and i think just doing that would begin to drive down those costs as the example i went for an annual checkup a year or so ago and had an issue the physician said well i can prescribe a course of antibiotics that is about 300 a month and 3 months from now that condition will clear up i have got a prescription drug card so it was going to cost me 15 or whatever i said 900 he said yeah i said well what happens if i do not do that he said in about 3 months it will clear up i made a costbenefit analysis and decided that i would forgo the antibiotic treatment and go with the professional judgment it was my decision i need to stand behind that decision and if 3 months later my condition had gottenworse and i had other problems that may have been fixed if i had taken a different tack i cannot go back on the doctor or should not and sue the doctor or the pharmacy or whatever sue anybody that is still breathing because of a decision that i made personal responsibility is not only taking responsibility for paying for health care but also reclaiming your health care decisions because those are yours you are responsible for that and you yourself know there will be the occasional bad outcome to any procedure to any field and that is just nature doctors are not perfect or hospitals none of us are those legitimate just bad outcomes is just the system and we ought to take personal responsibility for that i had several doctor clients and to a person if they did something wrong if they created an issue or made something that aggravated something with a patient they were going to fix it period no matter what it was but in many instances they used their absolute best professional judgment to treat a patient and they just got a bad outcome that is life so this personal responsibility issue that i am talking about is decisions for what health care you do get or you do not get and the costs i think the health savings accounts that we have instituted in certain instances will help us do that so that putting away money in a health savings account if you have a normal monthly kind of an expense come up i have to decide do i take that money out of my health savings account that is growing or do i figure out a way to do it out of this months budget or my normal operating budget so bringing that personal discipline back to the table in the arena of health care is not the absolute overall magic bullet but it is a piece of the fix that is health care costs i appreciate this opportunity to share this hour with the gentleman and i look forward to hearing the remainder of the gentlemans comments from a learned colleague in an arena that is obviously of vital importance to all of americans"], [0.9999929666519165, 0.9999929666519165, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume senate 571 sponsored in the other body by the

and probably more than a third of them have some kind of a disease that might be able to be benefited by embryonic stem cell research that is true of the figures in the country we have 110 million people who have illnesses out of the 290 million people who are living here they have visited my office they have visited your offices there is not a person in this room who has not had many many visits by people who have very very serious needs whose lives are going to be shortened i am all for the first bill we debated today because i think it might help somewhat but i have also looked at some statistics and i have come to realize that of the 15 leading diseases adult stem cells cannot do anything about 14 of them and can do a only little bit about heart diseases as they deal with only blood diseases in terms of what they can do embryonic stem cell research has the ability perhaps to do much more than that people are going to get up and they are going to say well it hasnt done anything yet they were only discovered about 62 years ago if you read the vast body of research in the united states of america on this subject by people who are truly knowledgeable you are going to learn there is more potential here than anything that has ever happened in medicine in the history of the united states of america congress should never ever turn its back on this opportunity how are we going to get there how are we going to do embryonic stem cell research i do not have time to go through the whole in vitro fertilization process except to say that we create embryos in that particular process they are then frozen they are generally used and well used the 400 000 embryos which are out there to help give birth to people who might not otherwise be able to have a child but at the end of the process a decision is made by the individuals that may be involved with that if the decision is they no longer want that particular embryo they may do a variety of things with it they may as has been discussed here give it up for adoption they may decide to have it discarded as hospital waste that is where the vast almost all of them actually go as hospital waste we want to give them the opportunity to say within that embryo there are stem cells which could help other people live better lives and give them the opportunity to be able instead of having it put in a bag for hospital waste sitting at that table to be put over here and the state to be able to do the research that is what we need to do we need to be able to develop that as rapidly as we possibly can for the benefit of all mankind i rise today im support of h r 810 the stem cell research enhancement act i have been in public office for over 30 years and throughout my career ijust like all of youhave had the opportunity to change and improve public policy so this country may continue to flourish on the principles it was founded and the 820 000 people i represent in the state of delaware are a constant reminder to me of this responsibility i am their voice in the congress of the united states some of you may be wondering why i have become so interested and involved in embryonic stem cell research and frankly the answer is simplethose 800 000 constituents we estimated that aboutonehalf of all visits to my office are about health care and about onehalf of those visits are by delawareans who are suffering themselves or whose family members are sufferingfrom juvenile diabetes alzheimers cancer parkinsons hiv and hosts of other dredge diseases year by year the groups would grow in number and soon we would have to get bigger rooms for our meetings in the early years we would discuss the necessity of funding the national institutes of health and i was proud to be able to support newt gingrich and the republican partys drive to double funding for the nih and that funding has gone toward the basic science needed to find cures and treatments to our most debilitating diseases but in the past few years the number one topic on these groups minds was embryonic stem cell research one little girl stands out in mind i met her a few months ago at an event back in delaware olivia was two months old when she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes her parents were first time parents so it is no wonder that the practice of testing her blood sugar and giving her insulin shots was extremely heartbreaking olivia is now 6 and has never known life without diabetes she is the person we are fighting for on the floor today she is one of 110 million people who are suffering that may be helped by stem cell research i remember very clearly the difficult decision president bush made on august 9 2001 and i know how careful he was to balance the needs of science with his own moral concerns at the time the compromiseto allow federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells lines that had already been derivedseemed quite reasonable but as we know unfortunately the number of lines eligible for research once as high as 78is now only at 22 with the nih saying the number of lines will never get above 23 so when diana degette and i began discussing how to expand the presidents policy in an ethical manner i went right back to the speech he gave to the nation in 2001 we wanted to be as consistent as possible with the ethics he laid out in his speech as we worked to update the policy the legislation we are going to vote on today h r 810 the stem cell research enhancement act which has the backing of the medical groups the scientists the research universities and the patient advocacy groups mirrors the presidents ethical requirements i will read them to you and ask that you think about them very closely 1 embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need 2 the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom the embryos were created have determined that the embryos will not be implanted in a woman and will otherwise be discarded and 3 the individuals for whom the embryos were created have provided written consent for embryo donation and without receiving financial inducement you may ask what is differentwe simply lift the arbitrary august 9 2001 date it is also critical that we are clear about what this legislation does not do 1 no federal funding for the destruction of embryos or human life this is prohibited by law 2 no federal funding for the creation of embryos for research under our legislation it is up to the couple to decide what should happen to their embryos embryos can be adopted or donated embryos can be frozen for future family building embryos can be discarded after that initial decision is made and if a couple decides to discard the embryos our legislation would allow those couples to make a second choice do they want to donate them to research an embryo or blastocyst is about 250 cells and the inner cell mass is about 100 cells and that is where the stem cells come from they are created in a petri dish are about 5 days old and are the size of a pine head of the 400 000 frozen embryos in in vitro fertilization clinics throughout the unitedstates about 2 percent are discarded annuallythat is about 8 00011 000 embryos that could be slated for research allowing the option of donating these excess embryos to research is similar to donating organs for organ transplantation in order to save or improve the quality of another persons life the bottom line is when a couple has decided to discard their excess embryos they are either going to be discarded as medical waste or they can be donated for research throughout this debate you will hear about adult stem cells and more about umbilical cord cells and how these types of cells are sufficient for scientists this is simply not true umbilical cord cells are adult stem cells and they are limited adult and umbilical cord cells are already differentiated into the types of cells they are they are difficult to harvest and grow and they do not exist for every tissue type on the other hand embryonic stem cells are master cells they have the potential to grow into any type of cell in the body they are easier to identify isolate purify and grow and they are capable of cpntinual reproduction listen to what the nih has to say on this topic human embryonic stem cells are thought to have much greater developmental potential than adult stem cells this means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotentthat is able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely multipotentrestricted to specific subpopulations of cell types as adult stem cells are thought to be in 2003 1 6 million people died of heart disease cancer diabetes alzheimers kidney disease liver disease and parkinsons of the 15 leading causes of death adult stem cell research only addresses one adult stem cells have been around since the 1960s embryonic stem cells were only isolated in 1998 we must explore research on all types of stem cells but the reality is the only policy that is restricted is the federal embryonic stem cell policy the nih is the right place to oversee this research because it can regulate the ethics it provides for scientific collaboration and peer review and promotes publication so all breakthroughs are reported and all scientists have access to the latest research discoveries without nih oversight there are no guidelines as to how this research should be conducted the united states has always been the premier leader in biomedical research in our country and around the world as science continues to move rapidly forward we need to continue to lead the way but we are not why should we waste one more year one more day forcing millions to suffer because of a policy that is outdated and unworkable does this congress really want to look back 10 years from now and say that we were the ones holding the treatments up or do we want to be the congress that says we back science we want research to flourish and we played a small role in making that happen support h r 810 the stem cell research

more positive perspective a brighter outlook and hopefully a little more unifying message than we have just heard and frankly than we often hear in the united states house chamber especially by some of my good friends from the other side of the aisle we call this the official truth squad i thank the leadership and the conference for allowing me to come and share a few words tonight the official truth squad grew out of a frustration on the part of the freshmen class of the republican conference we all were elected in 2004 24 strong now 26 of us here in the united states house of representatives after a relatively few number of months we grew frustrated with the fact that there was a lot of misinformation and a lot of distortion and a lot of frankly deception that was going on here and so what we wanted to do was to put together a group of folks that would come to the house floor and try as best we could to provide some truth some facts to the situations that we address here in the united states house of representatives we have just gotten back from a week at home a district work period over the memorial day week i heard from constituent after constituent about two big issues one was illegal immigration obviously the largest issue we have to deal with as a nation right now but the second one in meeting after meeting after meeting with constituent after constituent all across my district on the north side of atlanta was people asking why on earth is congress so divided why is it so partisan why do you have the kind of sniping that goes on and i am loathe to answer that question because it is so difficult to understand why there are many in this chamber who are not interested in working positively or productively together it just boggles my mind these are not democrat problems or republican problems these are american problems and american problems deserve a united congress working together so what you have just heard in the last 15 minutes is an individual who will tell you that quote this is a republican congress problem well we do better if we work together the fact is that it is extremely difficult to get anything moving forward positively in congress without the support of many different folks and so we work better when we work together what you hear so often is what i call the politics of division the politics of division is so destructive they do a disservice to every single one of us in this nation i tried to put some words to the consequences of the politics of division and i think i have found a quote i have shared it with you before and it comes from the reverend william boetcker who was a philosopher and leader around the time of the late 19th century and early 20th century he described what he said was a social philosophy and he attributed it to abraham lincoln nobody can actually determine whether president lincoln actually said these words but reverend boetcker talked about them and i think they crystallize and capture my concern my suspicion about what the consequences are of this politics of division that is so destructive he said you cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong you cant help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer you cannot encourage the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred and you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich now that kind of crystallizes i think what is a unifying american philosophy it is a philosophy that would serve us extremely well here in the united states house of representatives how often do you hear people just castigate out individuals who are more wealthy than others destroying the rich in an effort to build up the poor it doesnt work that way it doesnt work that way our system never has our system never has done that and so the official truth squad tries to bring some credibility and truth to these discussions we have adopted a motto which is a qubte from a wonderful united states senator daniel patrick moynihan from the state of new york and this quote i think makes it so that everybody has to be held accountable and what senator moynihan said is that everyone is entitled to their opinion and they are and opinions are here in the countless number everyones entitled to their opinion but theyre not entitled to their own facts everyones entitled to their opinion but they are not entitled to their own facts which is why it is so frankly troubling that the blue dog group gets up here night after night week after week and talks about

dollars you didnt hear that from folks on the other side of the aisle that is the truth that is the truth how many in new taxes 54 billion in new taxes talk to me now about what the truth is and what is being proposed and what is being said in washington and what is being voted on in washington and what is being said back home how many mandatory savings the republican conference all on their own in a very difficult way because we got no cooperation from folks who will tell you one thing at home in fact they will tell you one thing that same thing in washington but they will do exactly the opposite we gained 40 billion this savings with the deficit reduction act earlier this year how much mandatory savings on the part of the other side zero zero that is the truth that is a fact that is not opinion that is a fact the bills that they brought forward the blue dogs my good colleague just before me talked about wanting a balanced budget we have given them an opportunity to vote on a balanced budget in fact we did so just 3 or 4 weeks ago here on the floor of the house of representatives not a single one of those 37 blue dogs voted in favor of that balanced budget not one they talk about making certain that you pay as you go that you only pay for programs that you have the money for we have offered that on the floor of the house we do not get the support of the blue dogs they talk about having a rainy day fund doesnt it make wonderful sense to have a rainy day fund because we know year after year after year we will have emergencies like katrina or other emergencies there is an average of 20 billion annually where there are emergencies that need federal money during the course of any given year on average 20 billion so what does the republican congress propose that we are being accused of doing in fact what we do propose is a rainy day fund in the budget that we just adopted for fiscal year 2007 how many members of the blue dog how many of those 37 blue dogs voted in favor of that rainy day fund not one not one same number that we got when we talk about the mandatory savings zero not one of them support it i want to talk about a little positive information about this economy because you wont you may not hear about it on the nightly news you may not read about it in your newspapers you certainly wont hear about it from some folks who want to make certain that they practice this politics of division and this politics of deception did you see the new job figures last month the month of may 75 000 new jobs created and this economy over the past 12 months has created 1 9 million new jobs 1 9 million new jobs more than 5 3 million new jobs since august of 2003 the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 6 percent lower than the average of the 60s 70s 80s and 90s a picture oftentimes says it so much better than any of us can so let me see if i can show you the picture of that kind of job growth that we have seen over the past 3 years here it is on a graph here we are in january 2002 with unemployment up at about 5 7 to 8 percent here is the job growth at that time and then on the bottom we have the number of months going by we havent even gotten to this month but earlier this year what has happened to the unemployment rate it has gone down whats happened to the job growth it has gone up significantly again 5 3 million new jobs since august of 2003 so the curious individual the individual who wanted to solve problems and work positively and productively on behalf of the american people would say well what happened when this seemed to change when unemployment h3420 co rates began to go down when the job growth began to go up what happened what occurred there well lo and behold you know what happened we had tax decreases appropriate tax decreases responsible tax decreases by making certain that americans got to keep more of their own money and when you allow americans to keep more of their own money what happens they spend it and they save it in wise ways and then the economy flourishes so because of the tax policies of this congress of this congress and this administration we have seen increasing job growth and decreasing unemployment what else about the economy is going on revised reports show the fastest real gross domestic product growth in over 22 years in the first quarter real gdp growth grew at an annual rate of 5 3 percent in the first quarter productivity increased at an annual rate of 3 7 percent in the first quarter hourly compensation real hourly compensation rose at a 3 2 annual percentage rate in the first quarter personal income increased at an annual rate of 6 7 percent in april since january of 2001 real after tax income has risen by 12 9 percent why mr speaker because of tax policies appropriate responsible tax policies put in place by this congress this administration this leadership and oftentimes in spite of what you hear at home and in spite of what you hear by my friends on the other side of the aisle oftentimes more often than not frankly without a single individual helping on that side of the aisle in fact they come down and they say these tax decreases the tax reductions will destroy the economy will throw people out on the streets but you know what happens what happens is that unemployment goes down job growth goes up and in fact sometimes they will even say that at 1 minute and then they will vote for the same thing that they just said was awful just said was awful just a moment before that truth is so doggone important in the public discourse remember you can have your own opinions but you are not welcome to your own facts you have got to talk about facts and that is why the official truth squad takes the opportunity as often as possible to come down here and talk about facts talk about facts with the american people because the politics of division again does a disservice to every single american we live in a glorious nation a wonderful nation a nation that is still seen by men and women around the world as a beacon of liberty and a repository of hope i am proud to serve in the united states house of representatives and to have the opportunity to share a positive productive perspective and vision with my colleagues and i hope that we can be joined by more and more colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we work to"],

consolidation of tracon first off the faa has furnished us with rules on cost savings which are just totally unrealistic number two in the boise airport to which mr hastings referred we have not only general aviation commercial aviation and the national guard control out of the boise tower but we also have the national interagency fire center which attacks the wildfires on blm and forest service ground all over the west and finally i would say this is such a bad idea but it would be a terrorist dream to consolidate all of our air traffic control into one center would be a tremendous target for those folks and so with that once again i thank mr hastings for his leadership on this and for the time and i would like to offer letters from the governor from the national guard bureau and also from other interested parties for the record in support of the amendment offered by mr hastings the faa has embarked on a plan to collocate traconradarfacilities from airports around the united states my colleagues from idaho and i have had a number of contacts and meeting with faa on this issueand still there are few answers and lots of concems about the proposed move of the only tracon located in idahoboise airportto collocate facilities at salt lake city there are lots of reasons i could share about why this move is of concern to my constituents and i redundancy of tracon facilities in the vast intermountain west dramatic growth in the region air space flexibility for our biggest airport which also serves as the home to idahos active air national guard as well as the national interagency fire center which serves the whole west but there are general concems that i think speak to why it is important to support the amendment offered by mr hastings poor cost analysis limited savings the faa has only been able to show negligible savings with the proposed collocation after two meetings and repeated requests for detailed cost informationto include shortterm expenses and savings as well as longterm projected costs etc on april 27 my delegation colleagues and i met with administrator blakey at which time a rudimentary cost savings analysis was provided claiming only 2 47 million in savings over 25 yearsless than 100 000 per year more importantly by the faas own admission this analysis does not take into account all personnel costs such as the need to hire additional controllers due to loss of flexible scheduling dual training and other efficiencies currently used at the boise tower as well as other potential cost increases therefore the planned move will likely result in greater costs over that 25year pdriod poor planning it appears that the faas alternatives analysis being conducted on tracon collocation does not have a longrange plan or vision there is no plan on how tracon facilities will be collocated and or consolidated around the northwestlet alone across the countryas they look to maximize use of their new stars radar system at least none has been communicated by the faa when questions have been raised at meetings the process as presented by faa staff appears to be based solely on those projects that are currently working on getting funding or those that have funding earmarked and are ready to go to construction in the case of boise airport a much needed new air traffic control tower project has been delayed or benched after more than 16 million in earmarks have been worked on over the past 3 years b my idaho colleagues and me this setback will negatively impact the economic development opportunities security and safety concerns we have expressed to the house and senate appropriators in support of funding for this project colleagues we arent talking about decreasing the size of government or lowering our costs here until faa can articulate real cost savings and a national strategy for tracon collocation and consolidation we ought not go down this path any further i urge your support for the hastings wexler

evening and i am a little short on extra members and we are going to see how that evolves over the next few minutes but i want to begin the discussion on an issue that i think is really incredibly important to each and every one of us in this country and certainly as members of congress representing so many people constituents come to us i think every day and they may not say what are you doing about energy but they certainly come to us and say what is going on with the high price of gasoline we go to the pump we see the price going up sometimes more than one time in a day and we have seen prices well over 3 a gallon and what we know of course is that consumers are paying 100 percent more than they were paying 5 years ago the price at the pump was about 1 44 1 50 the average price of gasoline 5 years ago and now we are seeing prices certainly well over 3 a gallon and this is at the same time of course that we are seeing record profits from the oil industry and certainly my constituents say to me what is going on what can we do about this why isnt something more happening and they do understand there are some cauies of this but what i would like to discuss this evening is what is going on and what we have been doing about it and what we have not been doing about it that we should i think that is really what i am most concerned about as i see these issues in my district not only for gasoline we are not in the right season yet but we certainly know that home heating oil and home heating fuel has gone up as well in fact i commissioned a study in pennsylvania to see what the price was for home heating oil last winter and we saw increases on the average in pennsylvania of over 700 a year for a family that is a lot of dollars particularly for somebody od a fixed income young families struggling to make ends meet and of course making some of the choices are really very difficult for families and in fact what we are hearing is that families are telling us that it matters that they have seen a real effect when they see transportation and home heating costs going up an average of 75 percent increase over what they saw even in 2001 so what are we seeing what are we doing about this what do we expect to do there is certainly discussion on the floor about this issue and i know as democrats we have stood and really made quite a few suggestions some very specific as far as what we can do immediately the one specific one of course was what about price gouging are we seeing the price of gasoline go up because in fact there was some inappropriate illegal activity we have some preliminary information about that unfortunately we do not have a federal definition of price gouging so it has been really difficult to be able to say specifically whether in fact that is really what has been going on and what can we do more immediately to help make sure that the oil industry is doing all that it can to get us more affordable gasoline but there is no question that those are shortterm solutions those are not longterm solutions and what many of us feel is that we should be acting on longterm solutions and we should have been doing it already and why are we not doing it today because what we do today matters next year the year after and for years in the future so what are we doing to make sure that there is an adequate supply of energy in this nation are we smart enough tobe doing the kind of innovation and research that we know we need to do to be able to do this of course the answer is that we are that the answer has to be to diversify our energy sources to look at the different ways the innovations that are out there and bringing different kinds of fuel to our vehicles and to our homes and we have seen that already we have had numbers of our members talk about biofuels and the opportunity for ethanol we have just seen in my region of the country and we have seen it elsewhere in the country the fact that we now have mixed gasoline and ethanol we have 5 percent ethanol coming into our tanks in the philadelphia area that switch was just made a couple of months ago but we also know that you can have a flexible fuel vehicle you can fuel your vehicle with 85 percent ethanol well that is made out of corn in this country does that mean we reduce our reliance on foreign oil absolutely and should we be doing more of that how do we actually begin to make the kind of investments that really would matter where we can actually say we are using the kind of research the kind of smart scientists the engineers the innovation that exists in this country to bring new fuel options to our vehicles and to all of us so that we have a diversity we have more choices as consumers and then in fact there was an article in the inquirer just this morning that the oil executives themselves are saying this is a question of supply it is also a question of demand if there is less demand that would make a difference in price as well a report i heard said if we couldjust reduce demand by 3 percent in this country we could in fact start to see a reduction in prices so we have some real opportunities here and of course long term if we canstart to look at biofuels to be able to get them going be able to get the production up really much faster then we really have the opportunity to bring down the cost of fuel in this country for our automobiles now of course tied to that there is something many of us also believe and that is that we ought to be calling on the automobile manufacturers to produce more fuelefficient vehicles more hybrids more flexible fuel vehicles and more gasolinedriven vehicles that ae more fuel efficient and they can do it they know how to do it we need to make them do it more quickly and to be able to create that option for us so that we as consumers all of my constituents all of my fellow congressmens constituents all americans have greater flexibility and can make choices about what are the right kinds of vehicles for them to drive what is the most fuelefficient way for us to be handling our owntransportation needs so i will just say that those are just some of the ideas in fact there are so many ideas this is one of the things that when constituents ask what can you do i say we should be investing in serious ways in this country in these new technologies and then we should be insisting that our automobile manufacturers and our purchasers as well start to participate in this there are so many ideas out there i see a colleague of mine has joined us and i am excited about that because he is someone who is very knowledgeable about this whole area and what we could be doing but when we see the city of philadelphia that i represent that the new city buses they are buying are hybrid buses that can make a really big difference all of our cities should be doing that all of our communities should be doing that what about school buses what can we do to make them more fuel efficient these are things that we really need to be working on and i will say two of the things i have only been focusing on access to the energy we need and to price and the concern that consumers have on that but there are two other aspects of this that are very critical for us to understand and that is that of course it has an environmental effect if we continue to burn fossil fuels at the rate we have been doing that we actually continue the kind of pollution we have we cannot just have rhetoric about reducing emissions we need to take it really seriously if we plan to protect this earth we live in and protect the environment and the consequences that we have seen of some of the changes in the environment the increasing number of storms hurricane katrina is of course one of the examples that is in all of our minds and we are just approaching of course a new hurricane season the third point i was going to make in addition to cost and availability of fuel and the energy we need as well as the environmental effects is of course the third area which is our national security we all understand i hope we do increasingly understand our reliance on foreign oil sixty percent of the oil that we use is imported we need to reduce if not eliminate our reliance on foreign oil it changes the relationships that we have with nations that are not always friendly to us so we need to have a much different relationship to foreign oil than we do and that is we have to end our reliance on foreign oil but that is not going to be done unless we start to really seriously invest in alternative fuels and renewable energy sources both for our vehicles and of course for our homes as well so i am going to ask my colleague to join us i did want to also say that i hope we can in our discussion also get to a little bit of a discussion about what consumers can do what can individual americans do that could really change the way we use energy put more pressure on us on congress to create those alternatives someone asked me well where can you buy ethanolmixed gasoline where can you buy e85 in pennsylvania well the answer is there is one station in lancaster and there is one station in pittsburgh if you live in philadelphia that is a very long to drive to fill up your tank and not acceptable so we need to be kickstarting this we need to not just do a little bit wouldnt that be nice lets do that little project over there lets see how that goes we need to make a serious investment that changes dramatically the kind of energy options that we have for our automobiles for our homes for our daily lives and only by doing that will we be able to protect the environment for the future will we be able to end our reliance on foreign oil will we be able to bring down the cost of energy for our cars and for our homes if we dont do it now we are going to be having this same discussion only more seriously in the years to come so as democrats we have had a number of proposals but one of the leaders in really putting forward a new energy policy for this country and it is a wonderful one it is called the new apollo energy act i guess we would like to see if it gets to be an act and i would want to really encourage it and i am delighted that my colleague congressman jay inslee has joined us to talk a little bit about what that would do and how it would get us started in a very very serious way in changing the way we create the energy for ourselves for our homes and for our businesses"], [0.0020948052406311035, 0.5020948052406311, 1, "for as long as ive been in congress i have supported bankruptcy reform on two simple principles i believe people should pay their debts if they are able and that we should end abuses in the system whether by people who deliberately run up their bills or by businesses who exploit the gullible and the unfortunate my first vote in favor of bankruptcy reform was cast with reservations because some of the provisions of the bill seemed unduly harsh but i had hoped that the legislative process would ultimately improve the product unfortunately for 8 years we have been unable to see the bill move through the legislative process and improve it appears as though the bill if anything is actually less adequate due to increasing predatory lending by credit card companies and skyrocketing medical costs one of my deep concerns has been credit card mills which send out millions of credit cards to people who are not creditworthy in 2001 there were 5 billion solicitations by credit card companies meanwhile skyrocketing fees have been coupled with reduced minimum payments baitandswitch techniques have been employed that change the terms and raise the interest rates of cardholders who have never missed a payment while s 256 contains overly harsh punishments for middle class americans that have been preyed upon by the credit card industry it preserves loopholes for the very rich s 256 maintains a homestead exemption that allows people with lots of money to shield their assets by purchasing multimillion dollar homes in certain states o j simpson was able to shield many of his assets by doing this in florida there are even sophisticated trust arrangements that enable people with substantial sums of money to be protected from the provisions of this bankruptcy bill there are some simple common sense changes that could be made to this bill that would make it more fair to all parties involved the senate however was unwilling to compromise and approve any of these provisions and the house leadership has prevented any of these proposals from even being debated on the floor perhaps the most glaring example of the majoritys unwillingness to compromise is the rejection of an amendment that would protect soldiers injured in iraq and afghanistan from the unfair means test within this bill i have had meetings over the years with individuals who represent all sides of this issue the bankruptcy trustees judges and lawyers who represent the debtors and the people who extend credit to businesses large and small and to individuals rich and poor as a result of these meetings it is clear that the loopholes do remain and that the abuses of lending practices are not being reigned in the bill provides a mandate for unnecessary and burdensome paperwork and the most extreme requirements including personal certification of the facts by the attorneys assisting the debtor that are not found anyplace else under any other legal provisions this is going to shut down programs like the legal clinic at lewis and clark law school in portland and will make it harder for legitimate creditors to be able to get their money back in a timely fashion the sad fact is that most bankruptcies are due to large medical bills family breakup and job loss this legislation is going to put an unnecessary burden on the vast majority of unfortunate people and still allow too many of the unscrupulous to avoid their responsibilities it does not have to be this way i continue to hope that the political process will respond to these problems with sympathy and concern for the

it says 1 3 billion that is 2 billion short this is like no child left behind all over again you promise to pay high you actually pay low in this case it is not leave no child behind pit is leave no barrel of oil behind i understand that the argument can be made and i respect the argument that many renewable technologies did receive increases over last year many specific accounts for renewable energy research and development did receive increases over last years levels but only in washington can a 2 billion shortfall be called an increase try that logic with your utility company when the bill comes try saying i know i was going to pay 100 150 but what i really meant to say was i am giving you 15 no utility company would let you get away with it and the congress shouldnt allow that to be gotten away with the bottom line is the bottom line and if we are truly serious about ending our dependence on foreign oil and strengthening our military we would hot be shortchanging this bill i hope that the gentlemans efforts prevail i hope that this congress will have an opportunity to put our money where our mouths are when it comes to renewable energy not just as an environmental issue not just to get gas prices down but to make sure our military has the capabilities to defeat our enemies around the world"], [0.016250014305114746, 0.48374998569488525, 1, "today i join my friends and colleagues around the world in commemorating the horrors inflicted during the holocaust today we bear witness to the millions of jews and countless other innocent people who were brutally murdered in nazi concentration camps we bear witness to the horrors of genocide that shocked the world and ask ourselves if we have truly upheld the promise of never again when we hear the echoes of the holocaust in the rising threat of antisemitism today we bear witness to the millions of people who were persecuted and enslaved for their political or religious beliefs or their mental handicaps in the name of social cleansing but we also remember amazing acts of courage and kindness when those with everything to lose risked their lives and freedom to help those most iri need and the bravery of those who would not go willingly to a certain death there is a reason why we call this day not an anniversary but a remembrance every day but especially today we must remember not only the horrible acts committed by the nazis but also the actions and thelack of action that led to those horrors in remembering we honor those who sufferedbut our memories must also serve as a constant reminder of the vigilance required from each of us to prevent it from happening again or to take action if we see it happening never again should the innocent be left to languish for those who perished for those who survived for those who fought and for those who liberated we must not falter and we must not fail we must learn from history so that we are not doomed to repeat it we must bear witness"],

federal judiciary emergency special sessions act of 2005 h r 3650 authorizes federal courts to conduct business outside of their geographic jurisdictions during times of emergency congress must enact this legislation immediately so that the affected courts in the gulf region can continue to operate in the wake of hurricane katrina hurricane katrina has severely damaged perhaps ravaged is a better word federal courthouses in louisiana alabama and mississippi we must act with a sense of urgency to illustrate why consider the eastern judicial district of louisiana where operations are currently suspended there is virtually no federal district court presence there judges and court staff are physically scattered throughout louisiana and other states but crime in the district assault rape and robbery has nqt taken the week off yet there is no court that can act and no judge to preside criminal defendants will walk if deadlines established in the speedy trial act cannot be met in other words we must restore the rule of law in the eastern district of louisiana as well as elsewhere e 1645 the bill contemplates that affected courts could use other facilities that are convenient and practicable to participants under the circumstances the special circumstances allowing courts to operate outside their normal jurisdictions would continue only until the vacated courthouses could be
