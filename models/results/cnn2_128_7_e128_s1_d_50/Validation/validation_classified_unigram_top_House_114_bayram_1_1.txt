attack womens health care this bill is an attempt to make permanent the socalled weldon amendment which pressures any federal agency or program or any state or local government with the potential loss of all of its labor and health and human services funding if it doesnt allow a healthcare entity to provide pay for cover or refer for abortions the majority purports that this legislation would protect religious liberty but in reality it is a thinly veiled attempt to restrict womens access to safe and legal abortion to be clear religious liberty is one of our nations most fundamental and cherished values but it does not and should never mean the freedom to discriminate against or harm others this bill would unduly limit womens healthcare choices by allowing a broad set of health providers including many employers to deny their female employees access to legal medical services based on any and all objections this legislation could not possibly have been written more broadly specifically the conscience protection act would allow employers and insurance companies among other healthcare entities to refuse to facilitate make arrangements for or otherwise participate in abortions women of color lowincome families lgbtq individuals young people and those living in rural areas already experience widespread and systemic barriers to health care this vague and overly broad language will exacerbate the significant barriers to care that they already face additionally the bill would give virtually any individual or entity standing to sue for an actual or threatened violation as civil rights organizations have noted this broad right of action would chill state local and federal governments ability to advance prowomens health policies by exposing them to frivolous resourcedraining lawsuits by opponents of safe legal abortion undoubtedly this bill is a wolf in sheeps clothing in the name of religious liberty the majority is continuing its campaign to deny women access to safe and legal abortion and create a healthcare system that is legally permitted to discriminate against women women and all americans deserve access to the care and coverage that is right

zika vector control act is a farce designed to play on public fears over zika it has nothing to do with combating zika in fact republicans have been pushing the text of the underlying legislation for years under whatever name happens to be convenient at the time otherwise known as the pesticide trojan horse bill this legislation attempts to gut our ability to track and report when and where harmful pesticides are sprayed without oversight compliance physicians and scientists are less able to track and identify the cluster of symptoms caused by pesticides which in turn reduces their

leading cause of cancer deaths for women in the united states however over the past 40 years we have dramatically reduced the number of deaths from cervical cancer according to the cdc this decline

article from abc news north carolinas controversial antilgbt bill explained the article says several civil rights groups and lgbtq advocates are organizing a rally tonight in raleigh this is from march 24 of this year north carolina to protest the states controversial passage of its house bill 2 which critics have called the most antilgbt bill in the country the article says heres everything you need to know about the bill also known as the public facilities privacy and security act which was signed into law by governor pat mccrory on wednesday what does it do house bill 2 declares that state law overrides all local ordinances concerning wages employment and public accommodations thus the law now bars local municipalities from creating their own rules prohibiting discrimination in public places based on sexual orientation and gender identity though north carolina does have a statewide nondiscrimination law it does not include specific protections for lgbtq people we keep adding letters you know we kept adding letters until we got to lgbt and now we have added q the law also directs all public schools government agencies and public college campuses to require that multipleoccupancy bathrooms and changing facilities such as locker rooms be designated for use only by people based on their biological sex stated on their birth certificate transgender people can use the bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity only if they get the biological sex on their birth certificate changed under the law public institutions can still offer single occupancy facilities and nobody has a problem with that if you have got a single bathroom facility that has just got one facility for going to the bathroom that is fine it can be for whoever needs to use it but they are saying as has been consistent with the history of the world for most of the worlds existence that if you according to documentation are a female you use the female restroom when it is for multiple peoples use at the same time and if by documentation you are a male you use the male facilities it has really been shocking to see how many people including singers and entertainers and different groupsi understand target now wants to make sure that boys can use girls restrooms as they please but it has been amazing that such people have been demanding that we have to let boys who want to go in little girls bathrooms go in there if a man wants to go in a little girls bathroom according to the big popular movement now for heavens sake lets let the man go in the little girls bathroom north carolina has taken action consistent with the position of the world since the world began if you are going to have a multipleuse restroom normally you have a female go to a female multiuse restroom a male go to a male multiuse restroom this article goes on it says republican lawmakers who make up the majority of north carolinas general assembly publicly unveiled the language of the bill wednesday morning it goes on and talks about its passage in less than 12 hours i am talking about after its passage the bill was approved by the house and senate or after it was brought forward the bill was passed signed by the governor lawmakers in the house voted 8325 to pass the bill the senate approved the bill 32 0 after democrats who make up the minority walked out of the chamber in protest obviously they want men to go to little girls restrooms too republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from radical action by charlotte critics of charlottes ordinance said it could have allowed men who may be sexual offenders to enter a womans restroom or locker room by claiming a transgender identity well critics of the charlotte ordinance is what the article says but actually that is not just a claim that is a fact under what north carolina was objecting to if someone who is a sexual offender has decided he wants to go in and meddle in a little girls restroom where he has no business people like the entertainer that doesnt want to go to north carolina they are saying by golly you have got to let that man go in that little girls restroom what has happened to the sense that used to be such a prominent part of this country i mean there was a very intelligent man on fox news bill oreilly who actually asked a lawyer on a panel with him on the show so they passed this law they dont want men going into the womens restroom basically was the crux of it or boys going in where little girls go he asked the question actually who are they trying to protect i couldnt believe that we have come to the point where an intelligent person would have to ask such a stupid question whether you agree or disagree with what north carolina did whom they were trying to protect it is almost rhetorical clearly whether you agree or disagree they were trying to protect the little girls 1245 it is shocking that anybody would have to ask such a question gee whom are they trying to protect by saying men cant go into girls restrooms incredible the outrage aimed at north carolina has just been incredible i see an article today by ryan lovelace from the washington examiner trump slams north carolina bathroom law says state should leave it the way it is the way apparently charlotte was going to have it was that men could go in little girls restrooms of course sexual predators who are male all they have to do is say they are transgender and they get to go in the little girls restrooms and wreak the havoc that made them a sexual predator whom are they trying to protect in north carolina they are trying to protect innocent kids who cannot protect themselves they count on adults to keep them from harm it is incredible that people are outraged at north carolina anyone who has children who are female do you really want men to say i am transgender and get to go in where your little girl is going to the bathroom where you cant go because you are not transgender you are the girls father this article says what do proponents of the bill argue it says republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from radical action by charlotte john rustin president of the north carolina family policy council testified before the senate saying that the charlotte ordinance means men could enter women restrooms and locker roomsplacing the privacy safety and dignity of women and the elderly at great risk parenthetically i noticed an article in recent days last week that indicated that one of the leading colleges in pushing for transgender restrooms has had a problemand it has come up a couple of timeswhere men would come in where women were showering go into the restroom and use their cell phone hold it up over the stall so they can film or take pictures of the female who was trying to have some privacy in a very personal act of showering or going to the bathroom what is wrong with saying do you know what when it comes to going to the restroom females will go to female males will go to male and look if you want to have a single facility for one person at a time to use or families to use to change diapers or whatever those are really handy those are very helpful my wife and i have used them ourselves raising girls it is a handy thing to have but why condemn north carolina when they are just trying to protect the privacy of girls it has already been shown that if you give guys a chance to say i am transgender and i can get to go in and film a girl in a shower there will be people that do that why not let the transgender lgbtqrstwhatever the initials arelet them have their activities where they dont impose upon the privacy of someone who wants to go to the restroom or shower without someone from the opposite sex being there with them governor mccrory wrote this statement the basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings a restroom or locker room for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of charlotte as a result i have signed legislation passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach of basic privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect april i i mentioned that i understand target may now be changing their restrooms i will have to doublecheck because if they are going to be having women come to mens restrooms i wont be going to target to shop unless and until that changes usually target is great they have the restroom right there where you go in the door to the store normally you dont have to go clear to the back of the store it is a handy thing if you have to go shopping it is handy but not anymore anybody that wants to go to the restroom and have privacy from the opposite sex may need to shop elsewhere we will have to look at what they have actually done anyway this article seems to make the point that it is not such a crazy thing that north carolina has done and that is why for 99 999 percent of human history since civilization exists since we got past the caveman era when there have been public restrooms you recognize there is a difference between males and females some day it will be written in the rise and fall of the united states that the greatest freest and most powerful country in the history of the world showed symptoms of insanity when it reached the pinnacle of its greatness and successand this will be one of the symptoms that was written aboutthat they thought they were so much smarter than civilization for most of our history of the world that a difference was recognized between men and women for purposes of facilities it is a sad day for the country now i see this article from yesterday that curt schilling an espn analyst was fired over what they deemed as an offensive social media post here is what schilling said the post showed an overweight man wearing a wig and womens clothing with parts of the tshirt cut out to expose his chest it says let him into the restroom with your daughter or else you are a narrowminded judgmental unloving racist bigot who needs to die apparently this kind of thing offends espn although at one time their job was covering sports now their job is being social managers apparently in making sure that if men want to go to little girls restrooms then we let the men go to little girls restrooms this article from yesterday talking about target stores says target says transgender customers may use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify how about that et tu target so here we are at the place in our history where insanity in the name of political correctness rules the day common sense is no longer common and to the point that the current leader in the republican campaign for president even says that north carolina should not have taken action that in essence says menwhich would include sexual predatorsshould not be allowed to go in womens restrooms he wanted it left like it was so if charlotte wants to say that if you are a man and you are a sexual predator and you say

but by being an outspoken and forceful advocate for the end to gun violence not only for her district in chicago illinois but for all communities across this nation gun violence in the united states has reached epic proportions in the 21st century the death the trauma the devastation that we are witnessing can no longer be tolerated congress must act now over the past decade in america more than 100 000 people have been killed as a result of gun violence and millions more have been maimed by the reckless and unlawful discharging of firearms i applaud president barack obama for taking this historic executive action to address gun violence in our nation these actions will save lives and will make america a safer place the presidents actions will strengthen lifesaving background checks improve mental health services and expand smart gun technology we have all that we need in the united states to observe the second amendment rights of americans and at the same time to take our nation into the 21st century with responsible gun ownership that leaves little room for the illegal gun activity that we see taking place in terms of gun trafficking in terms of the use of deadly arms in the hands of those who are unlicensed to hold them as it relates to background checks the proposals focus on new background check requirements that will enhance the effectiveness of the national instant criminal background check system the nics and the greater education and enforcement efforts of existing laws at the state level specifically it directs the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives to require any business that engages in the sale of guns to obtain a federal license to do so and to conduct background checks it calls for the increased funding for the atf in the hiring of 200 new atf agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws and it requires the atf to issue a rule requiring background checks for the purchasers who purchase certain dangerous firearms and other items through a trust a corporation or other legal entity it encourages greater communication between federal and state authorities on criminal history information what could be wrong with that that is within the boundary of our laws within our constitutional rights and it makes our nation safer i come to this floor today as one who considers herself to be a victim of gun violence we need to confront this right away because for many in our communities it is not only those who have been physically harmed by gun violence but those who have been traumatized by being a witness to gun

his colleaguesworkplace domestic terrorism that incident has been with me from that day forward to this day at a moments notice i can recall the trauma of that day what it meant to see my colleagues life taken from him and to hear the gunplay that took place in the new york city councils chambers i am not alone there are millions of americans who are witnesses to gun violence or who may have been maimed by gun violence and who did not necessarily die as a result of it but whose lives have been changed dramatically we should not have another generation of americans who can speak to the unspeakable horror of what it is to either be impacted directly in the loss of a loved one or to be the families who have to recount the times when they have had to be at the hospital with someone who

they can provide breast cancer screenings cervical cancer screenings contraceptives birth control the only thing they dont do is they dont provide abortions outside the limits of the hyde amendment

adversely affected by provisions in h r 5 which propose changes in the funding allocation formula for teacher support and the quality of educational services under title ii of the no child left behind act mr chair if we dont adopt this amendment we may inadvertently break a long bipartisan agreement on our fundamental need to ensure that our lowincome students are not assigned less qualified teachers and less quality educational resources than their more advantaged peers the reality is that a school district that serves students in poverty faces many many hurdles and challenges in recruiting and in retaining teachers as well as other qualified staff current law prioritizes teacher development funding to states and schools serving the greatest concentrations of students in poverty specifically the no child left behind title ii formula for school districts focuses 65 percent of funds on students in poverty and 35 percent on the number of students which is students in poverty versus just the number of students the state formula focuses 80 percent of its funding on poverty and 20 percent on student population h r 5 completely upends this it eliminates this critical prioritization by equally weighting poverty with mere student population sort of cutting the baby in half 50 50 this removes substantial federal support from schools and states serving the poorest students and gives these funds to schools and states without similar levels of economic need this of course mr chair has an impact on every single state in the union where there are disparate levels of income in our communities it undermines teacher training and student achievement for students in poverty my amendment simply would delay the implementation of this formula until the secretary of education certifies to congress that students in poverty are not adversely affected by this change in service quality and level this would provide the appropriate caution before eliminating that critical safeguard of funds for students in poverty as written we have strong reasons to fear that h r 5 would result in federal dollars being siphoned away from states and school districts with the poorest students and being awarded to states and schools with higher affluence in fact data from the unitedstates department of education released earlier this week show that h r 5 translates into billions of dollars of cuts in school districts serving high populations of black and hispanic students mr chair since all politics is local i must decry the loss of these educational resources to the
