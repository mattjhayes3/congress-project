"i thank my colleague from hawaii one of the other small states i know youre a delegation of two were a delegation of one i represent the whole state of delaware i tell my constituents that we have two senators and one member of congress that means that i have to work twice as hard to serve the people in my state im pleased to join my freshman colleagues on the democratic side of the aisle this afternoon for our discussion about small business and job creation and id like to talk for a little bit about the situation in my state the state of delaware all of us are coming off a district work week where we spent our time im sure meeting with constituents talking to business owners small business owners large business owners and working our districts and i did the same thing in delaware not too far from the capitol here i would like to highlight two meetings that i had in particular one was a job fair that we held in georgetown delaware which is the county seat in the lower part of our state many people from the washington d c area know georgetown as they pass through it to go to our lovely beaches during the summer time to enjoy time with their family at the beach this particular day we sponsored a job fair in georgetown along with senator carper and senator coons this was a program that senator coons championed in wilmington initially and weve moved it now to the other two counties of our state and had a job fair in dover and a job fair in georgetown this past week really helping to connect those folks in our state who are unemployed or underemployed people looking to move up with employers who are looking to hire and even though we have over 9 percent unemployment nationally and a little bit over 8 percent unemployment in our state of delaware there are still a lot of jobs that go wanting mostly because the employers are not able to find people that have the required skills for that particular enterprise so the good news about this job fair is that we had 55 employers there many of whom were prepared to hire people and offer them jobs certainly take resumes and interview people or set up interviews but we had over 8 000 people who came seeking employment or seeking an upgrade in their current job situation and thats a lot of people in the small state of delaware in the least populous area of our state so it tells us the very serious problem that we have with the lack of jobs and the lack of skills that people might have to do the jobs that are out there later on in the week i met at pats aircraft which is an airplane manufacturing facility at georgetown airport theyve been hiring airplane mechanics over the last several years in fact when i was lieutenant governor one of the biggest problems that they had was finding workers that had the requisite skills to do the jobs that they had now they have since lost some of that work but they were looking ahead and anticipating with some assistance from the faa to extend the runway there at georgetown airportgoing back to your point about the need for infrastructure to stir business development business growth and job creation if we were able to extend the runway there at the airport pats would be able to hire more mechanics but there are a lot of people out there while they might want those jobs would not have the skills to do the work and so delaware technical and community college with the help of the state government has developed a training program specifically to prepare workers for that facility and other airplane manufacturing facilities in our region we have a dassault falcon plant which does airplane maintenance and mechanics at the new castle county airport as well as a large boeing facility over the line in southeastern pennsylvania so these are jobs they are highly skilled jobs they are jobs that require mechanical ability they are jobs that require training and there are certainly lots of folks out there that are looking for employment and these are the kinds of jobs that we need to prepare people for one of the press conferences we had this week was at delaware technical community college where we highlighted a federal grant that was going to delaware tech to create training programs for businesses basically to enable people to upgrade their skills to take the jobs that are available one of the problems obviously that we have in our countryand the presidents employment council has identified this problemis that we have jobs that are out there but we dont have people with the right kinds of skills for those jobs so we need to have programsand this is where the public sector comes into play particularly technical and community collegesto provide that training and those skills for those folks later on in the week i met and spoke with the georgetown chamber of commerce and the georgetown chamber of course is comprised mostly of very small businesses they had a really simple message for me as a member of congress and that is that they see their businesses struggling because of a lack of confidence among consumers and when you think about the unitedstates economy at large about 70 percent of economic activity is consumer driven so when consumers dont have confidence either in their employment situation in the presentthey may not be employedor their future employment situation theyre not willing to spend money on small business services or products in the community and therefore these small businesses suffer so their message to me was really a simple one twofold one is do no harm in washington dc do the work of the people solve the problems that we have and inspire confidence and i think one of the ways that we can do thattheres a lot of discussion most of the discussion that i hear from my constituents in the state of delawareand weve had town hall meetings were going to have a telephone town hall meeting tonight im sure i will hear the same thing enough with the partisan bickering back and forth across the aisle lets focus on the challenges that we facecreating jobs and strengthening businesses creating a business climate in the short term where businesses can thrive where consumers can have confidence so theyll be willing to spend on small businesses and other procurement and in the long term address our deficits our debt and our budget imbalances if were able to do that well at least provide some confidence to the people that we represent that those that they send from delaware the members of the house of representatives here and our senators across the capitol are doing their part are working together are focused on not the politics of where we all stand in relation to the next election but on solving the problems that face our country i think the vote that we have coming at the end of this year which will be the result of the work of the committee on the budget will be maybe one of the most important votes in a number of years i have heard our majority whip steny hoyer refer to it as the most important vote here in the last 30 years and i think thats right in many respects because people out there my constituents your constituents ms hanabusa in hawaiii see our colleague from rhode island has joined us as wellour constituents are asking us begging us to do our work to inspire confidence and to do the right thing for the country and that involves giving people the skills they need to be able to do the jobs that are available out there creating confidence so businesses can make investments so people will be willing to spend money and consume so our economy will get back on its feet again in the long term well set up a fiscal situation with our government so that the economy can be strong and create jobs for my children and their children so i want to thank my colleague from hawaii for leading our dialogue this afternoon on job creation on small business development across our country in our respective districts and i look forward to sitting here with you for a few more minutes and engaging in this dialogue i just wanted to give a few words about how the people in delaware are responding to the work that we are doing or are not doing here in the congress"], [0.9337005987763405, 0.06629940122365952, 1, "inquiry last night in the committee that is exactly why we are allowing for the time so that members can review such a big

republican opposition to military action in kosova was political it absolutely was not i remember because i was very involved in trying to mitigate the balkan troubles i visited there many times visited with milosevic the dictator in belgrade actually i was in vukovar right before it fell so frankly the statement that was made earlier i think did a disservice to those of us who were not supportive of the kosova operation there was no plan to war protect the kosovar albanians we used air power milosevic invaded with ground trops if members will remember that countrys population was literally literally pushed out into macedonia and elsewhereabout 1 6 million refugeesbecause there was no plan when milosevic sent in the ground troops and killed thousands of people because we had no plan to protect them an estimated 10 000 people were killed so the revisionism that somehow republican opposition to the war was a political calculation falls very very far from the truth and its a cheap shot i actually chaired hearings during the war and stated my oppositions based on principle as did other members so i expectand hopeunfounded revisionism would be avoided and that there would not be that lookback that does a disservice on the issue at hand to principled republican opposition so who exactly are we backing in libya what justification under international law is there for directing both unitedstates and foreign government assets to a rebel entity that is not democratically elected and therefore not necessarily representative of the people of that country we dont know

cleanup program one of the most important roles of government is to protect public health and safety however the amount of money appropriated in this bill is insufficient to do one of these most important areas our amendment ensures that nuclear cleanup sites get the funding they need to protect surrounding communities from radioactive contamination in my community and that of mr reeds in western new york the west valley nuclear waste reprocessing plant was established in the 1960s in response to a federal call to commercialize the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from power reactors just a few years ago the site ceased operation and more than 600 000 gallons of highlevel radioactive waste was left behind posing a significant and enduring hazard this site prone to erosion contains streams that drain into lake erie located just 30 miles away we have already seen a leak on the site develop into a plume of radioactive groundwater if this radioactive waste makes its way into the great lakes the largest source of surface fresh water in the world the environmental and economic implications would be devastating without question this hazardous and radioactive waste and the contamination that remains is one of our nations largest environmental liabilities in these cleanup efforts time is money failing to adequately fund the nondefense environmental cleanup program decelerates cleanup efforts for the past four decades progress in cleaning up west valley has been delayed by legal disputes and funding shortfalls for west valley this means 30 million in added maintenance costs per year in the current budgetary climate it is more important than ever that the federal government use taxpayers money most efficiently we cannot jeopardize the irreplaceable

recognizing and thanking chairman king and ranking member thompson for their continued leadership on this incredibly important issue the lessons of 9 11 have taught us we must be continuously vigilant and proactive in seeking out and preventing our countrys most pressing threats thats why after 9 11 this congress strengthened what proved to be one of our nations biggest security threats up to that point aviation security and while i applaud the great strides weve made in aviation security we have not made the same level of improvements in port security this was such a priority for me when i came to congress last summer that at my very first homeland security hearing focusing on the 9 11 commissions recommendations to congress i asked lee hamilton the vice chairman of the 9 11 commission what should congress be doing to improve security at our nations ports he responded by saying my judgment would be that we have not focused enough on ports this lack of focus on our ports not only jeopardizes our national security but our economic security as well the unitedstates ports remain one of our countrys greatest economic resources as they provide our nation with the link to the rest of the world and the global economy each day unitedstates ports move both imports and exports totaling some 3 8 billion worth of goods through all 50 states additionally ports move 99 percent of overseas cargo volume by weight and generate 3 95 trillion in international trade however port security does much more than protect american commerce it also protects american jobs according to the american association of port authorities the unitedstates port industry supports 13 3 million jobs and accounts for more than 649 billion in personal income thats why i was pleased to cofound the bipartisan congressional ports caucus with my good friend and fellow alumnus ted poe in order to ensure that congress recognizes the vital role ports play in our national economy and the importance of keeping them competitive and secure despite all this ports have failed to garner the attention i think they deserve for instance in the unitedstates tens of thousands of ships each year make over 50 000 calls on unitedstates ports the volume of traffic gives terrorists opportunities to smuggle themselves or their weapons into the united states with little risk of detection according to a recent crs report a 10 to 20kiloton weapon detonated in a major seaport would kill 50 000 to 1 million people and would result in direct property damage of 50 billion to 500 billion losses due to trade disruption of 100 billion to 200 billion and indirect costs of 300 billion to 1 2 trillion congress attempted to address this issue by passing the safe port act in 2006 and the 9 11 commission act of 2007 which specifically required that 100 percent of the cargo coming into our ports be scanned by this summer unfortunately dhs has made little progress in achieving this goal and does not plan to implement it in fact weve recently learned that dhs has only been scanning about 3 percent to 5 percent of all the cargo imported into our united states now while the feasibility of scanning 100 percent of incoming cargo may be a legitimate concern there certainly needs to be improvement from where we are now whether its increasing the number of customs and border protection officers or investing in proven cargo scanning technology there needs to be a plan for effectively and efficiently scanning our nations cargo another major vulnerability is the threat posed to vessels during their voyage at sea for example cargo is often checked either before its shipped or after it reaches our shore however there has not been much light shed on the specific threats that exist between a vessels point of origin and its point of destination we also need to know more information about how fast a port could recover in the event of a terrorist attack or a national disaster if that did occur at one of our ports without resolving these issues we risk putting our economy and the safety of the american people at risk as a member whose district borders one of the largest port complexes in the country i understand the unique security challenges that ports pose to our economic and national security my district borders the port complex of los angeleslong beach which is responsible for approximately 44 percent of all the goods that flow into this country and 20 percent of the nations gdp during a 10day lockout in 2002 which arose because of a dispute between labor and management officials closure of the west coast ports cost the united states between 1 billion to 2 billion a day if an attack were to occur there it would be economically debilitating not only for my district but for the entire country as well while dhs has made a number of positive steps in strengthening port security and resiliency the lack of attention on these vital issues creates a huge problem for securing our ports we cannot begin to come up with an effective solution without first knowing the extent of the actual problem the economic importance of our nations ports combined with the existing port security loopholes is why i introduced the gaps act this bill will require the secretary of the department of homeland security to conduct a classified study of the potential gaps in port security and ensure that the department develops a comprehensive plan for addressing these vulnerabilities by focusing on the specific dangers that threaten our port security we can begin i believe to develop effective solutions to ensure that our nation is prepared again i want to thank chairman king and ranking member thompson for their leadership on this issue my congressional ports caucus

20 million people not 16 million people unemployed looking for work or underemployed so i guess all we need to do is cut taxes more and cut spending and we will have an economic boom yes we will have a boom like the boom of an imploding economy just like the last 10 years the worst job creation since the great depression under this theory that tax cuts solve every problem now the presidents response on friday was not surprisingly continue tax cuts the new one he has adopted is the social security tax holiday but dont worry we will make social security whole if we cut their income weve got to make the trust fund whole well borrow 110 billion from china well put it into the social security trust fund and everybody will get 15 or 20 a week and thatll solve the problems of this economy

the rape and bragging about it after learning this specialist neutzling reported the rapes to her command so what happened this time her command told specialist neutzling that they did not believe that she had been raped because she didnt act like a rape victim and did not struggle enough her unit commander also told her that he decided not to disclose specialist neutzlings allegations of rape to the investigative services because he didnt want the men separated from their unit if the men were charged they would have to stay in iraq or would have to go to kuwait additionally specialist
