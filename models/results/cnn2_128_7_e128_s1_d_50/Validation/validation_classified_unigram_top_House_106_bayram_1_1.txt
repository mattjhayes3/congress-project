100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that

is exactly what has happened an incredible amount of heroin is now being produced and it is now flowing from colombia look at this chart into miami some came through puerto rico because the administration cut the coast guards budget the coast guard protects the air around puerto rico they cut that in half so it came into puerto rico it came into miami and came into central florida and also is coming in through a weak link in the chain which is mexico this is the new pattern that we see mexico has approximately 60 to 70 percent of the hard narcotics coming into the united states coming in through mexico transiting through mexico now we have a new development in addition to a failed policy in colombia which this administration over the objections of congress the new majority in congress we repeatedly sent letters requests we passed resolutions we did everything we could to get them to give general serrano the head of the national colombian police and others the resources and ammunition eradication equipment to do away with drugs at their source costeffective when they get into our streets into our schools and law enforcement in this country tries to go after narcotics that is the most expensive solution to an expensive problem the problem is now a quarter of a trillion dollar problem and that is just the dollars and cents not the lives lost the families destroyed and the terrible scourge again of illegal narcotics this is the new pattern now what concerns me as chairman of this new subcommittee and with the responsibility given to me by the speaker is the presentation just over a week ago of the national drug control strategy by this administration one would think that they would learn one would think that if we had an experience and had a bad experience that one would learn from that experience what disturbs me and tomorrow we are going to hear from the nati6nal drug czar and i think general mccaffrey has tried to do a good job i think the former drug czar mr brown did a horrible job he presided over death and destruction of this land unparalleled unequal to anything except an attack that we had in pearl harbor but this is the proposal by the administration to deal with the problem now again one would think that they would learn let me tell what is in this first of all they have one of the most clever charts i have ever seen in my life it is i guess clintonesque in its explanation but last year this congress appropriated 17 9 billion for the war on drugs now they managed to develop a chart that showed us going from 17 9 billion to 17 8 billion a net decrease of 109 million and show it on a chart as an increase now that is clever in its presentation but it is disastrous in its effect where do the cuts come in let me tell you where these cuts are that disturb me that concern me again have we not learned interdiction has been cut dramatically again crop substitution programs cut again international programs cut again cut

for themthat is accessible affordable and accountable health insurance coverage this week congress and the american people learned from a census bureau report that the ranks of the uninsured has swelled by another one million i support the efforts of the republican leadership to givethese uninsured americans more choice in the health insurance market instead of expanding big government plans which president clinton has embraced to this end h r 2990 contains important changes in the tax code which we have championed in earlier tax relief packages including expanding medical savings

extraneous issues get before us there is no one on that side that i doubt their compassion for wanting to do the same thing i want to do and that is to not ever see another person get this disease the

work with it has been one of the real pleasures of my time in congress to have worked on this bill with him and i will remember it and i thank him for his cooperation but we cannot forget about what this epidemic is about there should not be 40 000 new infections this year for this disease now think about it for every one person who gets this disease it is a minimum of 10 000 in health care if we prevent 1 000 from getting it we save 10 million in health care that year the next year and every year if we drop the infection rate in half in this country we will save 5 billion in 3 years just by dropping the infection rate we will have more money to take care of everybody that has it plus we will be able to spend 5 billion on cancer research for breast cancer just by prevention we get lost in the wrong issues the issue is prevention this bill goes a long way in identifying that i will work with anybody to make sure nobody gets shortchanged when it comes to this but we have to work together to make sure that there is no waste that there is not exorbitant payments to groups that are not doing things to help people with hiv that we do everything that we can to make sure the next person

since she was 1 years old well this stimulator has proved to be a safe and effective therapy for patients with severe epilepsy but it has not been approved by the state of texas for patients under 12

bankruptcy reform bill based on dubious assertions by the credit card industry that the bill would result in lower costs to consumers one industryfunded study said that the bill would save the average household over 400 per year and this figure found its way into every witness statement and dear colleague letter as though it were an established fact it was also routinely cited in press accounts even after the study was flatly contradicted by a chorus of consumer advocates and bankruptcy experts even after the congressional budget office and the general accounting office were unable to substantiate the figure even after every witness at a subcommittee hearing admitted that corporate cost savings would not be passed on to consumers in the form of lower interest rates and today we are at it again we are considering legislation that would exempt large businesses from any liability for year 2000 failures for which they are in fact responsible and once again we are presented with a headlinegrabbing assertion pass this legislation or american companies will face 1 trillion in litigation costs well 1 trillion is serious money but where is the evidence where does that estimate come from i asked that question repeatedly in committee and i never received an answer never but later on i asked one of our witnesses who looked into the matter and i want to read into the record his account of where that number came from the onetrilliondollar figure emanated from the testimony of ann coffou managing director of giga information group before the unitedstates house of representatives science committee on march 20 1997 during which ms coffou estimated that the year 2000 litigation costs could perhaps top 1 trillion ms coffous estimate was later cited at a year 2000 conference hosted by lloyds of london and immediately became attributable to the lloyds organization rather than the giga group obviously those who want to use the trilliondollar estimate for their own legislative purposes prefer to cite lloyds of london rather than the giga group as the source of this estimate there has been no scientific study and there is no basis other than guesswork as to the cost of litigation this socalled trilliondollar estimate by the giga group is totally unfounded but once it achieved the attribution to lloyds of london the figure became gospel and is now quoted in the media and legislative hearings as if this unscientific guess by this small y2k group should be afforded the dignity of scientific data a guess that is what this legislation is based on a guess a guess that has acquired the status of an accepted fact through nothing more than repetition now i know this is old fashioned but before we proceed to confer blanket immunity on those who fail to act responsibly i think we should have something more than a guess and before we deprive consumers and small businesses of compensation for the losses they will sustain if their computers do not work i think we should have something more than a guess and before we override centuries of common law both at the state and federal level both substantive and procedural i think we should have something more than a guess we are told that this bill is necessary to encourage businesses to take the necessary steps to avert or minimize the year 2000 problem the lofgrenboucherconyers substitute does just that yet the underlying bill by removing the threat of liability discourages and undermines the incentive that companies have to do so to bring their problems into compliance and it is the american people who will be left holding the bag on january 1 the bill discourages compliance it benefits the large multinational corporations to the detriment of small business and the individual consumer
