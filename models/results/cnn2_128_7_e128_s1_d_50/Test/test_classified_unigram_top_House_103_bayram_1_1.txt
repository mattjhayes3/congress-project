could not cover her child with a preexisting illness as a member of congress one of the first tragedies we faced was a family that first lost their jobs and then lost their father because of a traumatic brain injury and then lost their home because they had no health care coverage this country can do better we can sit down and be rolled by the people with money by those who want to profit off of the present system or we can join together as a country and make sure that we cover all of our families and all of our children small business in america for the vast majority provide health care for employees but the competitive edge goes to the one side or the other of them companies that are smaller that often provide no health care coverage end up living in the system by having their employees covered by our premiums we pay higher premiums because of this some millions of people who are presently not covered when they end up in the hospital or getting health care benefits that

special supplemental food program for women infants and children i am pleased to note that the conference agreement contains an increase which allows for growth in this successful program wic also plays a major role in the ability of children to do well in school when mothers receive appropriate prenatal health care and nutrition there is a reduced likelihood that they will give birth to

increases the use of fresh fruits and vegetables among wic participants it provides another outlet through which our nations farmers can sell their fresh produce as we attempt to improve the eating habits of our nations families to assist them in meeting the dietary guidelines it is important that we increase consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables among wic participants the farmers market coupon program has been successful in accomplishing this goal since many of the wig participants come back to purchase additional produce oncethey have used their wic coupons we are in the midst of

programs that do not already appear in the 1978 law the appropriations for this program have gone down from substantial appropriations early to very little activity of late i note that recent administrations of both parties have only funded this program at a minimal level frankly i expect that that would remain unchanged unless of course you are successful in getting it into the crime bill

order the chairman of the subcommittee makes a legitimate point with regard to what the house committee has done the house committee has acted responsibly here is the problem we have run into though over in the senate the fact is that authorizers and appropriators sit on the same committees over there the same person site on the two committees and what is happening is that they do not pass the authorization bills they do everything in the appropriations process therefore we do not see authorization bills being passed we have run into it in our committee in an awful lot of instances so therefore either bills are not passed timely or they are never passed the gentleman from michigan hasjust mentioned a moment ago that there were lines of items where there has not been an authorization for 10 years he has done his work i would say to the house and put a bill over there the question is whether or not we are going to get it the only pressure that we have to assure that the authorization process works all the way through is to deny the appropriations if they have not met the rules it seems to me that that is what the gentleman from georgia is about doing here he is attempting not to subvert what the gentleman from michigan is trying to do in a positive way but he is sending a signal that if the authorization process does not work then indeed the appropriations ought not go forward so that we live within the rules of the house i rise in support of what the gentleman from georgia is doing he is not doing this with any attempt to be malicious to the coast

important than whether soldiers and sailors and airmen are sent into battle in haiti so i would ask the houses undivided attention to two specific questions that we are obliged to ask the president of the united states one if the united nations security council gets to vote on committing troops in haiti why can we not the congress the elected body of the people of the united states and what are the costs of committing troops there not only in terms of the very precious lives of our military men and women but to the militarys overall mission and our readiness to respond to priority hotspots around the globe put very plainly what will it cost and where will these resources come from more than 100 members of the house have written president clinton asking that he seek specific congressional authorization of any military action in haiti notwithstanding his prerogatives as commander in chief and absent a genuine emergency that threatens the safety of american citizens the president should first make the case for invasion and then let the congress become part of that process members of congress who hold very different views on united states policy in haiti agree that the president should follow the course of consulting the elected representatives of the american people i would submit that in any case if he cannot convince a majority of the house that will put his policy in peril to obtain a sustainable majority in both the house and the senate again the president has ought and he has obtained u n approval for the use of force is the congress to be denied that same opportunity some other questions that the american people need to know what national interests are at stake that justify the use of armed force in a foreign land how much plus what we are already spending patrolling haitian waters and the dominican border will such a haiti mission cost are other programs and readiness suffering as a result what are the objectives specifically what are the objectives of an invasion will we stay until president aristide in restored or remain until he and the duly elected parliament are cooperating to govern haiti what steps have we taken to prevent the infamous mission creep or nationbuilding that spawned disaster in somalia who will share the risk and the cost when we leave who will step in above all and i repeat myself on this what are the risks to unitedstates servicemen and servicewomen these are just a few of the questions that must be asked and answered in this chamber before we can truly say that we as elected representatives have done our job president clinton should consider military force only when he has run out of options not just when he has run out of ideas i have introduced a resolution a bipartisan resolution which seeks to form a bipartisan commission to look at explore study and hopefully go to haiti to find what are the facts and then to make some policy options suggestions to the administration the objective is not to tie the presidents hands but to lend a hand in devising a workable sustainable strategy and hopefully a lasting solution to the nightmare of haiti i believe that this is just one idea that makes more sense rather than rushing into battle there are a number of people across the spectrum both in haiti those who are concerned about haiti and policymakers of the previous administration and many others who have looked at this and said invasion is not the way let me be clear that no one wants to give any solace to general cedras and other leaders in the dictatorship who might look at this as a delaying tactic it is not we are hoping to devise a bipartisan strategy that continues the pressure on the military dictatorship the de facto government that has no place being in haiti while we look
