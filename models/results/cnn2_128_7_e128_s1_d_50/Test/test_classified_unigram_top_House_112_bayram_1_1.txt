in private and public health costs nearly every state has schoolbased health centers there are about 2 000 it provides mandatory funds for building and improving schoolbased health centers there are

ongoing war in afghanistan is quite simply the wrong war in the wrong time and in the wrong place intelligence experts agree that a terrorist threat to our nation does not emanate from within the borders of the nation of afghanistan there is a very real terrorist threat to the people of this country but by its very nature it is a stateless menace it is a menace that is likely to use as its base of operation wherever anarchy prevails and wherever the rule of law is lacking we cannot effectively combat this threat by occupying one country after another after another it is true that when we occupy a country al qaeda and other terrorist operations will likely flee for other areas but there are unfortunately plenty of areas of the world that provide hospitable footholds for al qaeda which is why a more effective strategy this nation is currently also engaged inbut which to a certain extent is not complementary to the heavyhanded occupation strategyis that of more light targeted operations and intelligence gathering and operations against terrorist operatives wherever they are to be bogged down in one particular nation state one that is host to a negligible number of al qaeda operativesit has been estimated that there are only 50 to 100 al qaeda operativesis simply counterproductive to the goal of keeping the american people safe beyond being counterproductive this is money that we cant afford this amendment which i strongly support will cut 90 billion from the occupation of afghanistan allowing 10 billion to be used to safely bring the conflict to an end and to maintain a lighter footprint of military operations to ensure that al qaeda does not regain a stronghold within the borders of afghanistan it is clear that the current strategy is not working the expenditures in afghanistan currently are 100 billion that is more than 1 billion per al qaeda operative within the borders of afghanistan most of al qaedas operations have moved across the border to pakistan and they have gained a foothold in yemen meanwhile we remain bogged down in a costly war without any clear end game that can be articulated by the people on the ground when we enter a military scenario it is critical to define what success looks like the nationbuilding operation undertaken with regard to the occupation of afghanistan does not have a clear outcome that is reachable the situation there will not be better in 6 months or in a year or in 2 years or in 3 years it is time to stop sending american taxpayer money that we dont have to a war that does not further the

duties the bill before us today will help the secret service carry out its role in protecting the president vice president and other dignitaries current federal law prohibits individuals from entering or remaining in areas cordoned off as restricted because of protection being provided by the secret service this bill would simply clarify that the prohibition under the existing statute only applies to those who do not have lawful authority to be in those areas the bill would also add the white house and vice presidents residence to the definition of restricted areas protected under current law the senate made minor changes to the bill including expanding the bills protections to areas in which the secret service is protecting a person by the direction of a presidential memorandum i support this amendment this bill will assist the secret service which did not have this protective function when it was created the role of the secret service has expanded greatly since it was established in 1865 to fight the counterfeiting of unitedstates currency the service became part of the treasury department in 1883 and took on many additional investigative responsibilities with respect to safeguarding the payment and financial systems of the united states it wasnt until 1894 that the secret service first started protecting our presidents and that protective role with respect to the president vice president and other dignitaries has grown substantially since that time the men and women of the secret service conduct themselves with valor and professionalism while carrying out the protective function of their agency they provide protection for a variety of people and events including the president and national special security events the secret service has other important functions which also deserve recognition for example the investigative role of the secret service has expanded greatly from protecting the currency against counterfeiting to investigating a variety of

of the bill would agree that this legislation didnt save the taxpayer one dime thats not what were talking about this bill when you pass it doesnt save one penny every year with respect to the discretionary budget we have appropriations committees in the house and the senate who go through the budgets and they decide whats appropriate and whats necessary to be budgeted for those agencies and those accounts every year they can cut them they can increase them based on the needs that are perceived by members of congress who are acting on that thats not the issue we need to tighten our belts in fact back in august we made some significant savings we need to continue to find savings in fact my view is if were really going to be serious about reducing the deficit and the debt weve got to do this in a balanced way like bipartisan commissions have suggested youve got simpsonbowles youve got rivlindomenici all of them have said weve got to do a combination of cuts and we also need to deal with the revenue we can no longer afford to have tax breaks for the folks at the very top that we cant keep all of these tax loopholes open that disproportionately benefit certain people over others and tax breaks that actually encourage in some cases the export of american jobs when we want to be encouraging the export of american goods and american services so thats a very important debate that we should have but thats not what this does this just has to do with how we present the baseline as to what can be purchased in terms of goods and services for certain dollars and moving to this will create a very misleading perception everyone knows lets say it took a certain amount of money to buy an aircraft carrier today and we wanted to know how much it was going to take to purchase an aircraft carrier 5 years from now lets assume over the next 5 years were in the midst of rising inflation what this would do is create the idea that since the number was the same this year as 5 years from now hey we can buy the same number of aircraft carriers thats not true youre going to get a quarter of an aircraft carrier and that isnt going to do anybody any good so again americans know that when theyre comparing dollars and the value of their dollars over time you have to take into account inflation 1750 it happens every day in terms of financial transactions all over the country so again this bill doesnt save a penny this has to do with just how you present the budget in terms of a picture for the american people to look at and whether its realistic in comparing what you can buy for a dollar today versus what you can buy for a dollar 5 or 10 years from now and what were saying is you should compare apples to apples so people know what the purchasing power of those dollars are in terms of goods and services then we as the congress can decide whether we want to increase that amount or cut it as we do every year but this bill doesnt mandate any kind of cutting of
