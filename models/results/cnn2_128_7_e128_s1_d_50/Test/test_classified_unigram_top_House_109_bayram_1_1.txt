amendments act of 2006 i want to thank the speaker and the majority leader for their willingness to go forward with this debate prior to our upcoming recess the 1965 voting rights act changed america it created the opportunity for minority citizens to fully participate in democracy prior to the enactment and enforcement of the act black citizens in the south were disenfranchised primarily because of the literacy tests and because of the design of election systems that submerged concentrations of black voters into large majoritywhite election districts the result was that africanamerican communities could not elect candidates of their choice to office why it was because black voters did not comprise sufficient numbers within the district and white voters refused to vote for candidates who were the choice of the minority community and so the votes of black citizens were diluted which is a clear violation of the principle of oneperson onevote the voting rights act permits minority citizens to bring federal lawsuits when they feel their vote is being diluted hundreds of these lawsuits have been successfully litigated in the federal courts in my prior life i was a voting rights attorney in north carolina as a result of court ordered remedies local jurisdictions have been required to create election districts that do not dilute minority voting strength when i was in law school 32 years ago there were virtually no black elected officials in my congressional district today i count 302 the voting rights act also requires some jurisdictions to obtain department of justice preclearance to any change in election procedure this at first blush may appear to be unfair to those jurisdictions but the jurisdictions that are covered have a significant history of vote dilution and this requirement of preclearance simply assures that the jurisdiction does not intentionally or unintentionally make changes in their election procedures that will discriminate this is called section 5 section 5 has prevented many many election changes that would have disenfranchised minority voters it serves a useful purpose and should be extended a short story and then i will close in 1953 in my hometown of wilson nc the africanamerican community worked very hard to teach the literacy test and qualify black citizens to vote they then organized and elected an african american to the city council in a district with a large concentration of black voters that was big news when it was time for reelection in 1957 the city council arbitrarily and without notice or debate changed the election system from district voting to atlarge voting which resulted in the submerging of black voters the change also required voters to vote for all city council seats on the ballot if not the ballot was considered spoiled it was called the vote for six rule needless to say that candidate dr g k butterfield was handily defeated if section 5 had been in place in 1957 this jurisdiction would not have been able to implement the changes and this community would have continued to have representation we have made tremendous progress in this country with respect ta civil rights and voting rights we must not turn back i urge my colleagues on thursday to vote for another 25year extension of section 5 of the voting rights act and require covered jurisdictions to get the

audacity of trying to pass a budget reconciliation bill that provides more tax breaks to the wealthy at the expense of important socialnet programs for the poor is unbelievable the programs slated to be cut include health care for veterans medicaid student loans and child support enforcement the idea that americas republican leaders would slash funding for veterans the day before they should be honoring them would be even more appalling than it already is if it were not so commonplace in fact this pattern has repeated itself throughout president bushs tenure in office the unitedstates invasion of iraq in march 2003 coincided with the sharp decrease in veterans health care and other benefits for those who have bravely served in our nations military the backlog at veterans hospitals had never been greater than when the united states went to war in iraq now with more than half a million soldiers having served in iraq the burden on the va will only increase and while the unitedstates has spent over 200 billion for military operations and reconstruction in iraq over the past 2 years during this same timeperiod the bush administration and the republican congress have repeatedly refused to provide veterans with the benefits they have earned and the benefits they deserve our nations socalled leaders have continually refused to fix the system called concurrent receipt whereby veterans health beiefits are deducted from their retirement benefita this veterans tax is wrong and it needs to be fixed unfortunately the republicans in congress are too busy trying to pass bills that would make the rich even richer instead of fixing real inequities in our system veterans deserve our respect not only on november 11 veterans day but all throughout the year they deserve our respect they deserve our support and they deserve all of the benefits our government has promised them without scrimping without exception without escape clauses they certainly did not offer any excuses when they enlisted in our military six weeks ago i traveled to iraq with a small congressional delegation to learn more about the mission and the heroic americans carrying it out

women who wear the uniform deserve so much more they deserve civilian leaders who will put their safety before their own political interests they deserve leaders who would not send them to iraq on false pretenses on a poorly defined mission without all the tools they need and without a plan to get them out of there and they deserve leaders who will give them adequate medical and financial support when they come home for all the reasons i have mentioned today it is time to bring our troops home from iraq we need to focus on healing the wounds incurred over the last 22 years of war and

up to 1 3 million they did okay over 1 3 million they did phenomenonally well now the presidents tax commission says that is exactly what the future should be that is trickle down we want more for the wealth not for those who work their proposals are extraordinary they would say that dividends should be free of tax so if one is someone who is lucky enough to be born into a wealthy family they inherit millions of dollars and they invest it in dividendpaying stocks they would never pay a penny in federal taxes because they are a wealth creator they are a job generator they are trickling down

market they would only have to pay at 8 percent if they had been happy enough or lucky enough to inherit money and clip dividend coupons they would have paid 0 percent but no if they built up their

evening ason each tuesday evening i rise on behalf of the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition a grdup of 37 of us that are fiscally conservative democrats that are concerned about the state of affairs in america we are concerned about the debt the deficit the budget and we are committed to trying to restore some common sense and fiscal discipline to our nations government and our nations budgeting process ever since i was a small child growing up in prescbtt emmet and hope arkansas i always heard it was the democrats that spent the money and yetit was a president named bill clinton from arkansas from my hometown of hope arkansas in fact that gave this nation its first balanced budget in 40 years from 1988 through 2001 america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having its fiscal house in order america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having a balanced budget it is hard now to believe that from 1998 through 2001 this country had a balanced budget because as we all know for the sixth year in a row this nation under this republicanled congress and under this president this administration has given us the largest budget deficit ever ever in our nations history for a sixth year in a row as a matter of fact as you walk the halls of congress it is easy to spot a fiscally conservative democrat because the 37 of us who belong to the blue dog coalition have this poster outside our office in the halls of congress as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 365 525 832 151 and some change that is a big number let us put it in a way that we all can understand it for every man woman and child including those born this 1ast hour every citizen of americas share of the national debt is 28 000 and some change where i come from very few of my constituents can afford to write a check for 28 000 and yet it is this kind of debt this kind ofdeficit that we are saddling on our children and grandchildren and expectingther someday to pay back and i believe it is morally wrong i raise these issues because you see my grandparents left this country better than they found it for my parents and my parents left this country better than they found it for my generation and i believe we have a duty and an obligation to try and leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for the next generation but instead for the sixth year in a row we have the largest budget deficit ever inour nations history this administration this republican congress continues to pass tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year just in the last few months this congress passed the socalled budget deficit reduction act here is~what it did it cut medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor disabled and elderly it cut student loans and a program for orphans to the tune of 40 billion and then they passed another tax cut to the tune of about 90 billion i was not real good in math in high school or college but you can do the math on that some 90 billion in tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year 40 billion in cuts to medicaid to orphan programs and to student loans that amounts to 50 billion in additional debt and yet the republican leadership in this body had the nerve to call it the deficit reduction act i believe it is time for those of us in the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition to rise up and hold this administration this congress responsible for these kinds of reckless spending habits that destroy future generations the budget the president has submitted for fiscal year 2007 some 2 8 trillion you have to givelit to him he has managed to cut all of the programs that matter to people health care education infrastructure economic development and yet give us the largest budget deficit ever in our nations history all at the same time how does he do that because he continues to propose to borrow money from foreign lenders foreign central banks foreign investors to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year what has it given us it has given us a debt of 8 365 525 832 151 by the time we complete this hour the national debt will have risen more than 41 million every tuesday night those of us in the blue dog coalition we are 37 members strong we come here to talk about the debt and the deficit and what it means not only to todays generation but to future generations because you see these are big numbers they are big numbers but let me put it in perspective not only is our nation borrowing about a billion dollars a day we are sending 279 million every day to iraq but do not dare ask the president how he is spending it or if he has a plan for how it is to be spent because he will tell you that you are unpatriotic some 57 million is going every day to afghanistan and on top of that our nation is spending the first half a billion we collect in your tax money each and every day simply to pay interest not principal just interest on the national debt we need 149 in my congressional district i need 1 5 billion to complete it give me 3 days interest on the national debt i can build 149 on the eastern side we are waiting on 169 give me 3 days interest on the national debt and i can

before i discuss the merits of this resolution i would like to thank my colleagues who have joined me in support of this resolution in particular the gentleman from washington the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from florida aceh was brought to my attention in the year 2000 by one of my constituents jafar siddiq hamzah a human rights lawyer from aceh mr jafar told me about the abysmal human rights record of the indonesian military and others throughout the province of aceh upon his return to aceh in august of 2000 not long after we met mr jafar was abducted in medan tortured for several weeks and found mutilated in a mass grave in the fall of 2000 cases like mr jafars happened too often and motivated me to push for an end to his 3decadelong conflict that he so much wanted to see ended that took over 15 000 aceh lives this resolution expresses support for the peace agreement signed on august 15 of this year by the free aceh movement and the government of indonesia this agreement saw both sides making several concessions in order to broker this peace the free aceh movement has abandoned its demands for independence and has agreed to disarm on the other side the government of indonesia has granted amnesty for the free aceh prisoners and has agreed to a timeline of troop withdrawal the memorandum has also given the people of aceh new political powers that will allow them to retain 70 percent of the revenue from the natural resources of their province a truth and reconciliation commission and a human rights court will also be established giving the people the machinery for justice as well as for peace the considerable compromises that both sides made in this memorandum of understanding shows their willingness to secure peace for the citizens of indonesia and aceh this resolution acknowledges and expresses support for the memorandum signed by the indonesian government and the free aceh movement this resolution further expresses hope that both parties will fulfill their commitments so that peace will be instilled in the region lastly and perhaps most significantly this resolution encourages the secretary of state and the administrator for the united states agency for international development to commit resources so that peace can be supported and so that peace will endure i support this resolution to show the people of aceh and the government of indonesia that the unitedstates congress supports this progress as well lastly as my good colleague from california mentioned the devastation of the tsunami the tsunami that took so many many lives perhaps that tsunami did take many lives and we know it did this peace accord will ensure if carried through that many many more people within aceh will not lose their lives and for that i

this point just in response to the gentlemans comments a second ago and earlier the reason for this amendment is that current law takes care of any state that wants to put a higher proportion of funds towards outofschool youth it has the flexibility for that and if they want to move in that direction they can it also allows states like massachusetts and at least 17 others who have a greater need to serve inschool youth for job training purposes to use their money for that what the h r 27 bill does is it takes away that flexibility and harms at least 27 states from being able to help the people that they want while it solves a problem that does not exist for the others the others already can in fact serve as many of the people they want out of school with respect to this money that is a duplication for it because there are other funds going none of those other programs have money left over for job training they are already used up most of them are underfunded safe and drugfree

agencies were limited in their ability to respond to hurricane katrina because they couldnt communicate the house select committee on katrina identified this as a key failure at all levels the select committees recommendation states in part that the department of homeland security should establish and maintain a deployable communications capability to quicklygain and retain situational awareness when responding to catastrophic incidents my amendment takes a step in the right direction and importantly does so before the wxt hurricane season which starts june 1 we must provide responders with the capability to talk across agencies within their agency when customary communications systems like phones are disrupted or destroyed this is not obviously a cureall approach to solve our nations interoperable problems but it is one solution that provides a stopgap system that allows responders to talk to each other using their existing hardvare from mobile or fixed locations when existing systems arent available fema has already been tasked with this responsibility before the next hurricane season the capability exists and needs to be rapidly deployed this amendment does not require additional federal dollars it simply provides 2 million and directs the department of defense and its technical support working group to work with fema using funds congress has already planned to

repair stations to a level playing field and second because we all know that a level playing field ensures free and fair markets competition and lower gas prices in recent years we have seen a sweeping consolidation of the oil industry at almost every level the manufacturing level wholesalers refiners and retailers one corporation can control the prices at every single step and that increases prices at the street corner my amendment is very straightforward it directs the comptroller general to study the effects of consolidation on prices on market economics and small business ownership most people who live in a community for a long time are accustomed to talking about their local service station where they know their mechanic and their owner where they know the prices but those days are in the past now their local facility is controlled by a giant corporation which has gobbled up their local facility and lower prices on the street corner have also become a thing of the past in 2002 the senate committee on government reform permanent subcommittee on investigations studied consolidation of fuel refineries the subcommittees findings are now over 3 years old and are alarming in their prescience as the report indicated corporate interests are dominating pricing controlling the market and pricing out privately owned retail outlets corporations are earning windfall profits while privately owned stations are struggling to keep afloat the subcommittee did not focus on wholesale and retail consolidation this amendment would achieve that goal and give us the data we

who is committed to this agenda and he would have been here tonight but he is serving as governor or will be in about a week i want to make two comments on the transition to a biofuels economy in the united states first off some people have said well we should not use fiber or plants for fuel we have to use it only for food i want to point out the fallacy of that argument right now we are exporting an enormous percentage of the foodstuffs we grow we send it around the world and they send us the cash what do we do we take the cash and send it to saudi arabia let us cut out the middleman let us grow our own this is time to grow our own we are sending it all over the world and then sending the cash to ridya and saudi arabia let us keep it right here let us grow our own fuel by the way this is no pie in the sky the department of agriculture has concluded we could have 30 percent of our fuel easily in the next 20 years easily using very conservative efforts this is a very achievable goal the second point i want to make is that this may happen eventually without congresss help but it will be too late brazil took 30 years to make this transition to an energy independent condition using their biofuels they use sugar cane there they took 30 years we do not have 30 years to wait we have a problem with alqaeda tonight we have trouble with global climate change tonight and we have trouble with a loss of a manufacturing base in america tonight we do not have 30 years so we need to act and we need to do some things that the past congresses and the current administration have not done let me just mention three of them number one they have not given loan guarantee assistance to get some of these plants going the first cellulosic plant in the world commercial cellulosic plant in the world is a company called iogen they are ready to build a plant they have contracts with 300 farmers to grow a plant using the leavings of wheat to use cellulosic ethanol in idaho but they can not get the loan guarantee to get the job done we want to get that job done and get that plant up and running in idaho and this is going to be three or four more times effective per acre with increasing profits to farmers as a consequence second to give americans this freedom to choose what fuel to use they have to have cars that burn both gasoline and ethanol and frankly the industry has not been willing to do that so we need to have some requirement to make sure that they make cars that burn gasoline or ethanol they make a car for less than 100 to burn either one so it is basically nothing to the manufacturers we need to require that to be done now they say they are going to do more of them in years but we do not have years third we need the pumps that pump either gasoline or ethanol made from midwestern corn or wheat or biodiesel but the folks in brazil will tell you that companies do not like putting those pumps in because now youre competing with their gas and oil they have a monopoly on gas and oil and they are not crazy about putting in a pump that competes with them so we are going to need to require that americans be given a choice in pumps maybe we start by saying 10 percent of the stations have to have an alternative pump of ethanol if you have 25 stations we do not want the moms and pops that have to do this if they cannot afford it but if you have a big chain why not have 10 percent of your stations at least have one ethanol pump so americans can have that choice we took the first step in this journey tonight when speaker pelosi said we are going to start making a shift from giveaways to oil and gas towards these new clean energy futures and i am looking forward to making progress and i yield to mr blumenauer"], [0.012623012065887451,

around the world they are able because of the pioneers who have gone before them to present themselves in the discipline and the competition that the sport requires i want to first say before there was a bill russell and a cazzie russell as well as a michael jordan and dr j in 1920 as was mentioned by my colleague other gentlemen came forth and began to play organized basketball that began and created a competition that endured in men the skill the tenacity the commitment and the competition to move forward as was mentioned in 1922 the first team the new york renaissance was established and in the 27 years that followed they played every year after them in 1930 the harlem globetrotters were organized to play basketball and everr though they could not play in the nba they continued to play it is important that as we move into this new season of the nba which will be starting in the next month that we not forget those who set the pace both africanamericans as well as europeanamericans and others who played the sport of basketball and brought it to our country and now around the world the basketball legends professional foundation is here to recognize and to assist

champions in 2003 and also in the semifinals in 2004 so as we pay homage to earl lloyd a former 1950s basketball player from my district as well as some of the others that came before him let us

recognized the contributions of the harlem globetrotters one of the first barnstorming teams that roamed the united states before professional leagues were integrated and the professional negro baseball leagues but no one until now has recognized the contributions of the early africanamerican basketball teams and their players before the new york knicks of the newly formed national basketball association signed nathaniel sweetwater clifton in 1950 an africanamerican organized professional basketball was a whitesonly sport accompanying clifton to the nba were earl lloyd and chuck cooper cooper lloyd and clifton may not be household names but their place in the nbas history will be secure forever the first white probasketball team was founded in 1914 the first africanamerican team came into being irl 1922 with the organization of the new york renaissance they were known as the new york rens the new york rens became one of the first great basketball dynasties in the history of the game compiling a 2 588539 record in its 27year span as an organized basketball team the new york globetrottersthe forerunner of the harlem globetrotterswere organized in 1930 other teams that came into being include the new york enforcers the harlem clowns the harlem road kings the harlem stars the harlem ambassadors and the philadelphia tribunes africanamerican basketball teams had a different style of play from their white professional counterparts they played for the fast break shot with onehand made short crisp passes and emphasized a vigorous style of defense their style stood in marked contrast with the waltzpaced game played by the twohand set shooters of the allwhite basketball teams these africanamerican barnstorming teams introduced a style of play that makes the world sport of basketball the wideopen fast paced game it is today before bill russell wilt chamberlain kareem abdul jabar julius erving and michael jordan we celebrated basketball notables such as tarzan cooper pop gates john isaacs and goose tatum just to name a few their love for the game allowed them to conquer many hardships on their barnstorming tours they traveled from town to town often sleeping in their cars because they were refused lodging they were denied service at restaurants and suffered all the indignities of jim crow laws the barnstorming africanamerican basketball teams were exceptionally talented and they had the chance to prove it when in 1948 the harlem globetrotters beat the world champion minneapolis lakers led by probasketballs first big man george mikan the
