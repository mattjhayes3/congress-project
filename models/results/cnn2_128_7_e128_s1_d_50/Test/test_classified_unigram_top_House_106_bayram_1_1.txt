deadline this year however it is also true that keeping our fiscal house in order does take a little longer than the freewheeling bigspending days of the past because we must ensure that all funding is spent efficiently and where it is needed the most the conference report before us this afternoon not only holds the line on the presidents additional spending requests but also responsibly funds areas important to every american citizen and protects the american people from waste fraud and abuse across the entire federal government earlier this year the republican congress made a commitment to end the 30year raid on social security and according to the congressional budget office we have now completed that task the president began the budget negotiations by taking a large step toward our position on the social security issue and joined us in locking away every penny of social security we worked with him in a bipartisan fashion to protect retirement security we were determined to protect american seniors and this congress and its leadership denied any piece of legislation on the house floor that spent one penny of it to achieve our goal of protecting american seniors and responsibly funding important programs we are including in this bill a plan to direct every federal agency to reduce spending by less than onehalf of one percent 38 percent of 1 percent by routing out waste fraud and abuse surely the government can save less than about half a penny out of every dollar this republican congress is simply asking those who run federal agencies to make fiscally responsible budgeting decisions with the money taxed out of our paychecks we all know the agency directors and executives know where the waste is and i am relatively certain they will be able to weed out at least that much in savings with this sensible plan in addition to meeting the fiscally responsible objectives this conference report also ensures that our principles of quality and flexibility in the funding for teachers have been met in the laborhhs section of the bill this congress ensures that funding may no longer be used to hire unqualified teachers provides that schools will have more flexibility in using their funding for improving the qualityof uncertified teachers and increases the amount of funding that may used for professional training for teachers the administration pushed for a onesizefitsall mandate in which washington controlled the 100 000 new teachers program not every district needs new teachers some need bettertrained teachers other districts need books hightech equipment and updated math and reading programs i think it is foolish for the washington bureaucracy to tell every school district in america that washington knows best how to spend tax dollars to educate our children the debate in washington is not only about money it is also about how that money should be spent this bill moves us closer to the right balance of education funding by providing additional funds for americas students through programs like pell grants and special education while lowering the bureaucratic burden imposed by washington through programs like goals 2000 the

eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and

only delay this so long before i came to congress i was a human resources professional in the electronics manufacturing industry that was back in the seventies when i first went into that business and at that time we understood the problems that were caused by related stress injuries in fact it was trendy to take care of our employees and find solutions when we had carpal tunnel syndrome on our assembly floor in fact the company i worked for began to see a large number of repeated stress injuries and when we figured out that the problems were occurring with one group of workers we realized that our printed circuit board assemblers were using the same motions repeatedly in order to do their job as efficiently as possible but in inserting electronic components into printed circuit boards they were causing themselves carpal tunnel syndrome the company was causing it without knowing it in fact what happened was in handinserting components into printed circuit boards one of the components was just not going in smoothly and it was the same component over and over and workers had to use their thumb to push that component into the board well little by little you can imagine what started happening to their arm now today to prevent such injury to employees most electronic companies have automatic insertion machines employees do not even use those same processes but back then the repeated push with the thumb did result in carpal tunnel syndrome over time well what i did as the human resources manager for this company was something that i am sure everybody over there would think is pretty darn odd i called calosha and brought them into the company and they came they observed the workers carrying out their task we worked with them as partners and came up with the appropriate solution for our workers and their symptoms disappeared you see it was important for us because we were a company that was growing rapidly and we knew that our workers injuries would certainly inhibit our growth and we probably would not become what had been our goal to become a fortune 300 company which we did but it would not have happened without a healthy work force the point is that business knew about repetitive stress injuries years and years and years ago many employers have stepped up to the challenge to prevent repetitive stress injuries they worked with osha they worked with their workers comp carriers because they know that their workers comp costs go up when they have injured workers so we do not need further studies employers and employees will not benefit from further studies but they will benefit from ergonomic standards we already have sound science regarding the problems caused by repetitive motion the problem i said it before and i will say it

is this what do we do to bring the pharmaceutical prices into line without bringing in nationalized health care the democrats are very easy to stand up here in front of you ladies and gentlemen and stand in front of my colleagues and promise you the moon the magic cure greener fields on the other side of the fence all i am saying is before you jump on the other side of the fence take a look at the consequences of the plan that they are proposing where do you think al gore the vice president is going to get his money from this it comes out of that surplus remember this is the first time in 30 years we have had that surplus as i say clearly there is a problem out there we need to address that problem but the gore approach and the democratic congress approach or at least the liberal side of it i have got to say i have got to restrain myself because we have several conservative democrats who do not agree with the liberal approach as just espoused by the gentleman from new jersey but the liberal democratic approach is the hillary clinton approach nationalized health care socialized health care i can tell a lot of you right now 64 percent of the people in america as i understand have some kind of prescription care service you better figure out what the gentleman from new jersey is proposing to do with the service of those of you that have prescription care in moving that to the people that do not have prescription care service there are lots of consequences to what the democrats the liberal democrats are proposing when they offer you something for nothing there is a price to be paid and i think it is incumbent upon the gentleman from new jersey and his colleagues when they stand up here and trash and cut down more conservative democrats or the conservative republicans i think it is incumbent on them to kind of have an openness requirement tell the people what the consequences are of nationalized health care tell people what the consequences are of a canadiantype of system talk about it tell the people what the consequences are of research for better medicines know this is why this congress just does not jump up and sign the blank check offered by the gentleman fromnew jersey we are not going to jump up and sign a blank check at least enough of us on both sides of the aisle are saying wait a minute what are we doing what are the consequences clearly we all agree on the problem despite what the gentleman from new jersey says nobody is patting the pharmaceutical companies on the back and saying be proud of yourself they have not done a good job in some regards with medicine but frankly it appears that there is some gouging going on out there but before my colleagues addressthat problem take a very careful look at what the democrat the liberal democrat approach is because i can assure my colleagues in the long run first of all they promise it will only be 10 percent of the surplus and a much much smaller percent of the budget and nothing will grow and grow and grow and it is the open door for socialized medicine in this country for a national health care and there are a lot of people who in my opinion will suffer under a national health care plan nobody should be forgotten and nobody should be left behind but there are ways to address that without going into a hillary clintontype of health care plan so my discussion here tonight was not intended to be on health care but there is nobody else that stands here to rebut these gentlemen as they speak here unrebutted for 1 hour about the socalled quote cruel hoaxes by the republican leadership those words ought to be stricken from the record they are inaccurate they are misleading the gentleman from new jersey and some of his colleagues they know that the cruel hoax by the leadership i did not say there is a cruel hoax by the democratic leadership come on we have more protocol on this floor we can be more ladies and gentlemen in talking about the problem the people that suffer while this partisan bickering goes on back here are the senior citizens that do not have prescription care or by the way anybody that does not have the ability to care for themselves but do not address it by waving the magic wand and saying look citizens we have got something for nothing we are going to take care of all of your health care needs we are going to take away your personal responsibility and the government is going to assume it remember every time and i cannot say this strong enough every time the government assumes one of your responsibilities every time the government takes a burden of yours and makes it a burden of theirs they take something with it it comes with a price somewhere we are losing a freedom somewhere we are going to lose the ability to have choice in the future so in summary on this health care plan let me say i am discouraged by the comments that were made previous to my speaking here this evening we do not get anywhere and i direct my remarks at the liberal democrats look we are not going to get anywhere with a nationalized health care plan we are not going to get anywhere with socialized medicine why do you not sit down instead of talking about how leadership has this cruel conspiracy going on by throwing a few bucks at insurance companies why do you not put the electionyear rhetoric aside and sit down with us and help us try and figure out what a solution is every day that we use that kind of rhetoric there are people out there who are suffering because my colleagues are not willing to sit down and put their heads together to come up with a solution and there is a solution i am optimistic that we can have a solution we do have a great country and we have made wonderful strides in health care but clearly we have got some problems in that system but we can fix it without having our health care provided by the united states of america which means they are going to oversee what doctors you see they are going to oversee what kind of prescriptions you get they are going to oversee what kind of treatments you get they are going to oversee how often you are going to get to see this doctor or that doctor socialized or national medicine is not the magic answer it appears to be tonight it is very easy to buy into this very easy to buy into this because the democrats the liberal side over here not all democrats i stand corrected the liberal democrats over here they think you are going to get something for nothing and they are saying look it is easy for us to afford it no problem remember you do not get something for nothing let me switch subjects and talk about something much much more pertinent i think really because of the olympics i hope some of you have are having the opportunity to watch it in fact i was over at the office before i came over this evening watching the olympics how exciting that is even if it is taped nbc or whoever does that the reality of it is look what we get to see clear across the ocean in sydney and watch those olympics and i am very proud of those people i want to tell you i heard an advertisement i will not tell you the name of the company the other day but i heard an advertisement about the olympics and it said our young men and women that go over there to compete in the olympics they will come home heroes and i thought to myself you know they will come over celebrities i would like to have their autographs i am proud of them but i think using the word heroes is somewhat of a delusion i think the real word of heroes is used in a different type of setting there are sports celebrities and there are heroes i have a perfect example i am not just up here talking without giving you an example it is happening this week in pueblo colorado first of all on my way over i real quickly grabbed a dictionary and i looked up the word hero hero a mythological or a legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability an illustrious warrior a man admired for his noble qualities one that shows great courage an object of extreme admiration and devotion with courage with that said let me read an editorial from one of the leading newspapers in the state of colorado the pueblo chieftain it is called patriots week what is patriots week about this is a celebration of heroes this week we anticipate more than 110 americans more than 110 americans who have been decorated with the medal of honor which is the highest honor our country can give out 110 bf them will be in pueblo colorado to

this week pueblo is hosting 110 medal of honor winners and they are calling their week patriots week i am going to go through my poster here in a few minutes with you and show you some of the interesting things about what this week is going to consist of first of all let me read the editorial out of the sunday chieftain star and journal my good friend bob rawlings who is the publisher and editor this is patriots week the home of heroes in pueblo colorado on tuesday the national medal of honor society convenes here for its annual convention pueblo is home to four medal of honor

is at the aircraft museum at the memorial airport in honor of his sister peachy wilcoxson and i know peachy today is constitution day all of these patriots spot for the ideals embodied in the united states constitution and many of their comrades perished in that effort so let each and every one of us reflect on that remarkable document and rededicate ourselves to the cause of liberty and justice well how exciting in pueblo alone for example i would like to just to kind of for a moment go over who are the four members who are from pueblo colorado as i mentioned in my comments unfortunately two of our members two of our citizens of pueblo passed away earlier this year mr crawford who was in the army you can see right here and mr sitter right here but we still have surviving drew dix the gentleman right here with the red dot and jerry murphy who was in the marines in korea this is the plaza that pueblo colorado has dedicated and put together through contributions from the local community here is a community that came together did not come to the united states congress and ask for money did not expect the government to do it they got together in their community of pueblo colorado to honor all medal of honor recipients but specifically to put something that will be a longlasting recognition of the four medal of honor winners from pueblo colorado that is what that little plaza is going to look like the statues here is one of jerry murphy 82 feet tall that is the completed statute there honoring jerry here so you have an idea there is bill crawford before he passed away as he stands with the statue of him which is also about 81 2 feet high this is going to be an exciting week in pueblo what i thought i would do is share with my colleagues four of the stories of these medal of honor winners i can tell you that i have had the occasion and i consider it amongst the highest privileges of my congressional career if i were to kind of recapture my memories of serving in the united states congress where i felt the most fortunate to meet somebody or the most privileged to be able to shake their hand i would have to put it in the order of i am catholic the pope and mother theresa and right behind them our medal of honor winners in fact i was in a parade in pueblo not very long ago and i had the opportunity in that parade to shake the hands of two medal of honor winners who were watching the parade you feel so much pride because these people are such heroes they really are what heros are the word they do not cause any delusion to the word hero h7715 they embody hero in its fullest envisions let me talk about drew dix i will point out drew here drew right here by the way a special hello to his mother a very sweet person in pueblo colorado let me talk a little about drew drew d dix unitedstates army special forces vietnam citation for conspicuous gallantry in the action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty sergeant dix distinguished himself by exceptional heroism by serving as a unit advisor to heavily armed vietcong battalions attacked the providence capital of chau phu resulting in complete breakdown and fragmentation of defenses of the city sergeant dix with a patrol of vietnamese soldiers was recalled to assist in the defense of the city learning that a nurse was trapped in a house near the center of the city sergeant dix organized a relief force successfully rescued the nurse and returned her safely to the tackle operations ceiter but that is not all being informed that now there were other trapped civilians within the city sergeant dix voluntarily led another force to rescue eight civilian employees located in a building which was under heavy mortar and small arms fire sergeant dix then returned to the center of the city upon approaching a building he was subjected to intense automatic rifle and machine gun fire from an unknown number of vietcong he personally assaulted the building killing six of the vietcong and rescuing two philippinos the following day sergeant dix still onhis own volition assembled a 20man force and though under intense enemy fire cleared the vietcong out of the hotel the theater and other adjacent buildings within the city during this portion of the attack army republic of vietnam soldiers inspired by the heroism and success of sergeant dix rallied and commenced firing upon the viet cong sergeant dix individually captured 20 prisoners including a high ranking viet cong official he then attacked enemy troops who had entered the residence of the deputy providence chief and was successful in rescuing the officials wife and children sergeant dixs personal heroic actions resulted in 14 confirmed viet cong killed in action and possibly 25 more the capture of 20 prisoners 15 weapons and the rescue of 14 united states and free world civilians the heroism of sergeant dix was in the highest tradition and reflects great credit upon the united states army raymond jerry murphy and if you ever go to pueblo colorado you will see murphy boulevard i mean these guys are real heroes their community loves them our country has deep respect for medal of honor winners excuse me not winners they did not win it medal of honor recipients and i stand corrected on that raymond jerry murphy united states marine corps korea citation for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as a platoon commander of company a an action against enemy aggressor forces although painfully wounded by fragments froman enemy mortar shell while leading his evacuation platoon in support of assault units attacking a cleverly concealed and wellentrenched hostile force occupying commanding ground second lieutenant murphy steadfastly refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small arms fire skillfully maneuvering his force from one position to the next and shouting words of encouragement undeterred by the increasing intense enemy fire he immediately located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire swept hill to direct evacuation teams to the wounded personally carrying many of the stricken marines to safety when reinforcements were needed by the assaulting elements second lieutenant murphy employed part of his unit as support and during the ensuing battle personally killed two of the enemy with his own pistol with all of the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units beginning to disengage he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of friendly forces of the hill and although suffering intense pain from his previous wounds he seized an automatic rifle to provide more firepower when the enemy reappeared from the trenches after reaching the base of the hill he organized a search party and again ascended the slope for a final check on missing marines locating and carrying the bodies of machine gun crew back down the hill wounded a second time while conducting the entire force to the line of departure through a continuing barrage of enemy small arms artillery and mortar fire he again refused medical assistance until assured that every one of his men including all of the casualties had preceded him to the main lines his resolute and inspiring leadership and exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon second lieutenant murphy and enhance the finest traditions of the united states marine corps william crawford our third pueblo citizen united states army world war ii for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of life and above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy in italy 13 september 1943 whencompany i attacked an enemyheld position on hill 424 the third platoon in which private crawford was a squad scout attacked as a base platoon for the company after reaching the crest of the hill the platoon was pinned down by intense enemy machine and small arms fire locating one of these guns which was dug in on a terrace on his immediate front private crawford without orders and on his own initiative moved over the hill under enemy fire to a point within a few yards of the machine gun emplacement and singlehandedly destroyed the machine gun and killed three of the crew with a hand grenade thus enabling his platoon to continue its advance when the platoon after reaching the crest was once more delayed by enemy fire private crawford again in face of intense fire and on his own volition advanced directly to the front midway between two hostile two this time hostile machine gun nests located on a higher terrace and placed in a small ravine moving first to the left with a hand grenade he destroyed one gun emplacement and killed the crew then he worked his way to the right and under continuous fire from the other machine gun emplacement he used one hand grenade and the use of his rifle and he killed one enemy and blew out the machine gun nest and forced the remainder of the enemy to flee seizing the enemy machine gun that was left from the one emplacement he fired on the withdrawing germans and facilitating his companys advance these are remarkable individuals carl sitter united states marine corps korea for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as a commanding officer of company g in action against enemy aggressor forces ordered to break through enemy infested territory to reinforce his battalion the morning of 29 november captain sitter continuously exposed himself to enemy fire as he led his company forward and despite 25 percent casualties suffered in the furious action he succeeded in driving the group to its objective assuming the responsibility of attempting to seize and occupy a strategic area occupied by a hostile force of regiment strength deeply entrenched on a snow covered hill commanding the entire valley southeast of town as well as the line of march of friendly troops withdrawing to the south he reorganized his depleted units the following morning and boldly led them up that steep frozen hillside under blistering fire encouraging and redeploying his troops as casualties occurred and directing forward platoons as they continued the drive to the top of the ridge during the night when the vastly outnumbered enemy launched a sudden vicious counterattack setting the hill ablaze with mortar machinegun and automatic weapons fire and taking a heavy toll in troops captain sitter visited each foxhole and gun position coolly deploying and integrating reinforcing units consisting of service personnel unfamiliar with infantry tactics into a coordinated combat team and instilling in every man the will and determination to hold his position at all costs with the enemy penetrating his lines in repeated counterattacks which often required handtohand combat and on one occasion infiltrating to the command post with hand grenades he fought gallantly with his men in repulsing and killing the fanatic attackers in each encounter painfully wounded in the face wounded in the arms and wounded in the chest by bursting grenades he staunchly refused to be evacuated and he continued to fight on until a successful defense of the area was assured with a loss of the enemy by more than 50 percent of their troops dead or wounded or captured his valiant leadership superb tactics and great personal valor throughout 36 hours of bitter combat reflect the highest credit upon captain sitter and the unitedstates naval service these four gentlemen that i just described as heroes who got the medal of honor are from pueblo colorado but i want to remind all of my colleagues there is what we call the medal of honor society and 110 members of that society will be in pueblo colorado this week to be honored by our community and to be honored by our nation for what they have done those four stories i told are but a drop in the bucket of the stories of valor the stories of courageous brave men and women who stepped out above the call of duty because they believed in america they believed in freedom and they were willing to lay their life down for it this weekend i had a wonderful opportunity to spend with my wife and my parents in meeker colorado and we were up at the cemetery an old cemetery we were in the old section of the cemetery and i walked by a grave and it was a young man not much on the gravestone had the gentlemens name had his birth he was 22 years old and all it said on the gravestone was he died for his country as we know we have thousands and thousands and thousands of men and women in this country who have died for their country and we have hundreds of thousands of men and women who have fought bravely for what this country stands for for the freedom of this country for the benefit of all of us we cannot acknowledge everybody with a medal of honor so we know that there are brave and courageous individuals out there who should have received the medal of honor who earned the medal of honor but did not receive it but we do know we still have a group of

bipartisan legislation calls for quotas to be placed on foreign steel to get back to its precrisis levels of july 1997 the bill would also set up a steel monitoring system that would track the amount of steel imports into the united states by foreign countries i am not going to go into detail this morning about the reasons why our steel industry and its workers find themselves in this serious crisis we have been through that in the months leading up to the vote on march 17 what i am here to say and to join the others in pointing out is that there still is a steel crisis in the united states and that we need something done immediately as many as four major steel companies are in bankruptcy right now and we know that when those goodpaying jobs disappear they disappear forever the need for our steel bill was clear on march 17 and today it is even more clear 289 house members believed that something must be done to stop these imports as we continue to see higher rates of steel entering the country each and every day the administration may argue that the amount of steel imports for the month of march represents a 30 percent drop in imports since november of 1998 and while that may be true shipments from countries such as brazil and japan showed a significant increase it is important to point out that just yesterday the president warned japan that the united states will take action if the steel imports are not returned to their precrisis levels i believe that is an absolute positive step in the right direction and i applaud the president for this action we must continue though in our action to make sure that passage of the bill that the house sent over is approved in the senate and signed by the president of the united states on behalf of the american

region already 25 varieties of salmon in the pacific northwest in california have been listed as endangered or threatened under the endangered species act and more listings are very likely to occur the causes of this decline are many but can be predominantly attributed to habitat loss water diversions and river alteration restoration of salmon stocks will be difficult and the work to restore

effort to be implemented by the states and the coastal tribes approximately 58 million was appropriated in this effort last year and the house committee on appropriations has allocated additional funding this year contingent upon an authorization h r 2798 would provide that authorization it has broad bipartisan support of the states the administration and fishing and conservation groups and i

the 3 percent telephone federal excise tax the tax should be repealed it has outlived its use it passed originally as has been stated by several colleagues as a luxury tax virtually every home in america now has a telephone even those that can afford very few luxuries indeed the tax was first passed a century ago when the telephone was a new and simple device today at the dawn of another century telecommunications has changed so much that it is impossible to apply the tax even fairly if consumers use a telephone line to access the internet they will pay this tax if they use a cable modem they will not furthermore how does this tax apply to new delivery systems will people who use delivery systems like dsl be taxed when they use dsl for telephoning but not be taxed when they use the internet i think our responsibilities include repealing old outmoded laws and also make it possible for our constituents to enjoy new advancements in technology this legislation does both in the

authorization for research and development activities of the faa the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner has laid it out very succinctly the bill reported by the committee on science was developed in a rather unusual spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship they really worked together on this it took a little time to hammer it out but i certainly want to congratulate the gentlewoman from maryland the chair of the subcommittee on technology for her good work and the gentleman from michigan the ranking democratic member for the fine work in crafting this bill i also want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin chairman of the committee on science for his efforts of bringing the bill forward and bringing it to the house for its consideration here today the faa as my colleagues know is responsible for the safe operation of a very complex transportation system it now handles about 11 2 million passengers per day that continues to grow i think h r 1551 has been well described by the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner it does provide for research programs that is going to enable the faa to modernize the nations air traffic system successfully because of the importance of air commerce to our economy i certainly recommend this legislation to my colleagues and ask for their support and the passage of this bill i rise in support of h r 1551 a bill which provides a twoyear authorization for the research and development activities of the federal aviation administration the bill reported by the science committee was developed in a spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship i want to congratulate the chair of the technology subcommittee mrs morella and the ranking democratic member mr barcia for their fine work in crafting the bill h r 1515 authorizes only a relatively small part of the faas budget but the research that will be carried out in accordance with the bill will have a disproportionate influence on the ability of the agency to meet its responsibilities for management and operation of the national airspace system the faa is responsible for the safe operation of a complex transportation system that now handles 1 5 million passengers per day and that continues to grow the faas research and development programs must provide the underpinnings for the technology that will help increase the capacity and efficiency of operation of the airspace system while ensuring its safety and security pursuant to an agreement with the transportation committee the republican manager of the bill will offer an amendment to modify the authorizations included in the bill as it was reported from the science committee basically some activities will be removed from the bill that were included in the main faa authorization bill considered previously by the house there has been some confusion about the nature of the activities that the agency includes in its facilities and equipment appropriations account clearly some of these activities are very similar to the kinds of r d programs normally authorized by the science committee and consequently these are retained in h r 1551 disagreements exist about the r d content of some of the other activities which the amendment deletes from the bill in order to ensure that a complete description of faas research programs is provided to congress in future h r 1551 requires the agency in its annual budget submission to report on all of its r d activities specifically the bill requires faa to identify every program regardless of the title of the budget category from which it is funded that meets the definition of r d according to ombs published guidelines h r 1551 as amended by the managers amendment endorses the administrations funding request for the r d activities covered for fy 2000 and fy 2001 this request includes growth in the second year needed to reverse recent declines in the research side of the agencys r d programs because of the importance of air

like i have made a contribution towards the same goal that the gentleman from new york wants to reach to remind him of what we have already done in this bill we have cut ida 223 million from last year over the strong objections in the committee and over the ranking member of our subcommittee we almost had to force the 200 million reduction in ida but nevertheless we did it i feel likei have graduated magna cum laude from college and come home to my parent and he is criticizing me because i did not graduate summa cum laude i think we have done a good job here and i think we have addressed

about a very important issue school construction and the companies that we are sending our children back to across this country because across america this week and next week and in the next several weeks to come depending on where one might live summer vacations are coming to a close parents are shopping backtoschool sales and teachers and students are gearing up for the coming year in my home county and state a lot of the schools have already opened and they are going to school unfortunately in many of those schools it is very hot they are not airconditioned the way they should be but children are in school in some communities we find that children are not going to school in schools they are in trailers they are in closets they are in basements they are in hallways and they are in anyplace that we can get children into because the crowding is so bad unfortunately this congress has failed to act to provide our local communities with any assistance with quality facilities for our children i could not help but think earlier today we have passed foreign aid bills we have passed emergency aid bills that we send overseas for foreign children to have decent places to go to school in in some communities and yet for our own children here in america members of the majority say it is not congresss responsibility to get involved it seems like i remember readingin my history books that that was not the responsibility of congress when we needed water sewer rural electric power and a whole host of long lists and ultimately we got involved and provided electricity for rural america the one thing that changed it and the list goes on our schools are bursting at the seams the communities throughout my district and throughout this country the flood of student enrollments are swamping our ability and the ability of local communities and local taxpayers to meet the needs it is time for this congress to stop arguing and start acting i have written legislation h r 996 that will provide 7 2 billion in school construction bonds on the democratic side today we lined up to sign a discharge petiti6n to bring the school construction bills to the floor so that we could take action and help children i will talk more about that in a minute but at this point let me yield to one of my colleagues from california who is a real leader in this congress on educational issues before she came to congress she was a school nurse she knows about the issues teachers face every day the issues children face i yield to the gentlewoman from california for comments on this issue as it relates to california and her district"]]}
