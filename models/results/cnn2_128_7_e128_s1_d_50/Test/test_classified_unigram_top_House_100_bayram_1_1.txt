forced into poverty by their needs for health care indeed they and their families are becoming slaves to the need for professional qualified home health care these votes come on the heels of the

that opportunity is lost millions will suffer the significance of this bill is more than procedural the days of the 100th congress are coming down to the wire after today there will be less

in support of the defense conference agreement i would like to commend the conferees for the outstanding work they performed in reaching in agreement authorizing 299 6 billion for defense consistiint with last novembers budget summit agreement and the fiscal year 1989 budget resolution i am particularly grateful for the excellent work of the distinguished chairperson or the military personnel and compensation subcommittee mrs byron for her leadership in shepherding legislalion i introduced earlier this year h r 3975 which directs the secretary of defense to establish a permanent rental housing program involving military personnel and their civilian landlords this program will remove perhaps the largest financial burden on our military families this legislation will make permanent the pilot program which has been in effect at fort ord over the last 15 months the program has been implemented with a high degree of success resulting in the solution of problems with military residents with respect to payment and landlords obtaining guarantees on security deposit payments although the senate defense authorization measure did not contain a similar provision h r 4264s housing lease indemnity program was adopted by the senate with two amendments i support both amendments the first amendment clarifies the due process provlsions of the program regarding each participating service members obligation before reducing that members pay for breach of the lease or damage to the rental unit and the other amendment outlines the extension of this program to our service members overseas i would like to take a few minutes to describe what this legislation will do first of all it authorizes the secretary of defense to make the program permanent each military service would then have the option of whether and at which inst llations to institute participation in this program in the united states second civilian landlords who rent to military personnel would agree to waive security deposits when renting housing units to military personnel for the guarantee of rental deposit security from the military in return the military post would agree that if for any reason the service member leaves without making final payments for rent or damage the post would make such final payments these payments could not exceed the amount of an ordinarily required security deposit any outlays of the military post would then be deducted from the service members paycheck for example a service member wants to rent an apartment for 500 per month under this legislation the landlord would agree to accept only a first months rent without any required security deposit or last months rent right away we are saving the service member up to 1 000 if the service member if transferred to another post or is assigned to onpost housing and leaves his apartment without paying his last months rent the post to which he is assigned would meet the last months rent payment of 500 this 500 would then be deducted from the service members paycheck all of my colleagues are aware of the tremendous financial and emotional pressures inflicted on our military personnel and their families this already tense situation is made even worse during a permanent change of station move travel and relocation expenses come out of the pockets of our servicemen and women reimbursement comes later although in the past only 1 out of 4 spent on a pcs move has been reimbursed according to an air force study and when the military families arrive in a new location they must meet the immediate costs of security deposits first and last months rent utility deposits and more before you can even blink a military family can be thousands of dollars in debt and 2 years later the entire process is repeated it is important to note that no appropriation of funds is necessary because the service member would be ultimately responsible for meeting the costs of any damage or breach of lease i know that the landlords on the monterey peninsula have benefited from the pilot program the favorable comments from the civilian landlords show that the vacancy rate has dropped considerably in their particular apartment complexes since participating in the program also a housing referral office representative available when requested during moveout inspections provided the verification necessary to resolve any disputes or misunderstandings that arose at that time they realize the hardships imposed on the military family and they understand the progam guarantees payment for damages and breach of lease up to the amount of the usual security deposit this program gives landlords one point of contact for all their military tenants and a source of information regarding military personnel who may soon be transferred thus enabling landlords to prepare for a change in the lease soldiers have been very happy with the program because without it they could not afford a place to live and would therefore be forced to live apart from their families until onpost housing became available the program has also kept soldiers from getting into serious financial difficulties which is often associated with a pcs move this program should solve one of the major problems facing our military personnel and do away with certainly one of their largest financial burdens what is more no one loses in this program everyone wins landlords are guaranteed payment our military personnel are able to use their hardearned dollars for necessities and the services are guaranteed reimbursement for any outlays to landlords when the house voted in the 99th congress to accept many proposals to ease the burdens on our military personnel servicemen and women all over the world breathed a sigh of relief now this legislation will resolve one of the most pressing and financially disabling issues by making permanent this highly successful pilot program permanent so that one day our military men and women will not look on military service as a financially crippling experience again i want to thank the conferees for their excellent work on reaching this conference agreement and express my appreciatiort to

rehabilitation law enforcement and eradication programs and while every member may not agree with all of the provisions in this legislation there can be no disagreement about the magnitude of the drug abuse problem facing our nation it is estimated that 1 2 million people in this country are addicted to cocaine and millions of people use marijuana regularly in fact a 1986 survey of high school seniors found that 57 percent of them admitted to illicit drug use tragically many of those drug users are teenage children these figures only hint at the enormous human and economic costs our nation suffers due to drug abuse we spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually to combat it in my own state of maine the cost of drug and alcohol abuse is estimated at 700 million per year for lost

oneill i believe decided to flex his authority in a direction that went beyond that which is good for the house essentially we began a process known as panning and panning is to use our television cameras to pan the house during special orders when oft times we are discussing very important items of the house and yet there are relatively few members of the house present on the floor they are either in committee or they are indeed in their offices using their televisions to observe the work on the floor and clearing their other legislative business if we are going to have that sort of panning in the house indeed it would logically be argued that one should pan during the entire session of the house for under normal work conditions we may be carrying on very important legislative business and still members will be in their committees or they will be in their offices et cetera and at a time of critical debate nonetheless there may be few members relatively on the floor we know that is the way the work of the house goes forward the point that i want to make is first that such panning draws a negative kind of attention and misunderstanding to the work of the house it may very well serve to undermine the exercise of free speech of a person in special orders with whom you may disagree but indeed to pan the house without a further explanation does attack the credibility of the workings on the floor that reality was never brought to mind in more crystal clear fashion than recently when we found ourselves working in the house on a memorial in which during special orders we were paying tribute to two of our past colleagues who had served us long and wellsala burton and stewart mckinney having passed away they were being addressed by way of memorial tribute during special orders to go back and look at that tape and see the panning of the house which would imply that few or almost no members cared when indeed endless numbers of members participated in those memorial services with panning it would indicate otherwise it not only affects the credibility of our house indeed it greatly affects the credibility of the words that were given that day on their behalf i might mention the words of one of my colleagues speaking on the floor in behalf of sala burton the gentleman is standing on the floor at this moment the gentleman from new york speaking to the house indicated i think that the entire event from the beginning of moving from the capitol steps out to andrews and then three planes full of people members of the house and others former members included and staff people and the memorial service itself were a tremendous tribute in recognition of what sala meant to all of us and panning at that moment there were but few members on the floor
