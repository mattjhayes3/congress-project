wanted if there is one thing both sides of this house can agree on it is keeping guns from terrorists i know my colleagues on the other side have expressed some concerns so lets address them you are worried that there are names on the list that shouldnt be there this is a legitimate concern so lets scrub the list you are worried that it is difficult to get off the list if you are wrongly put on

violate those rights my name wouldnt be on it we are not talking about prohibiting lawabiding nondangerous people from getting guns we are just talking about taking a pause i think we can all agree that it is better to err on the side of caution and let people get their names taken off the list rather than just sell them a gun and hope they are not a terrorist so lets scrub the list and make it accurate lets make sure the appeals process is functional and efficient and if someone is on the terrorist list and is denied from buying a gun lets pump the brakes and make sure they are in fact not

whether it is through mass shootings that make the headlines or the unseen violence that happens daily on our streets gun violence takes the lives of more than 30 000 of our nations citizens each year a number that far exceeds other industrial countries now all these countries have their share of violent extremists and madmen but only our country gives easy access to weapons of mass killing and that makes all the difference for america rather than seeking out commonsense solutions to address this crisis the republican majority continues to cower to the gun lobby and the firearms manufacturers now they plead the second amendment but constitutional law 101 would tell us that all of our rights including the precious freedoms of religion and speech must be balanced to protect innocent third parties and to protect the safety of the wider community one commonsense measure we should all agree on is background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill you cant shout fire in a crowded theater because of your freedom of speech and neither should you be able to buy a weapon if you have a history of violence and criminality in fact almost 90 percent of americans including the majority of gun owners support universal background checks for all gun purchases the problem is that our present background check system is rife with loopholes background checks are not required for private sales at gun shows they are also not required for internet sales bipartisan legislation has been introduced by representatives peter king and mike thompson that would finally close this egregious loophole it is an entirely sensible reform that would have a measurable impact on the safety of our schools homes and neighborhoods without preventing lawabiding citizens from using guns for selfdefense or recreational purposes despite attracting 186 cosponsors including several republicans the background check

prevent it now this week after intense public criticism and a historic protest by democrats on the house floor republicans seemed for a while to be willing to hold a vote on legislation they claim would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms after all nearly 2 500 individuals on the terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in this country but rather than embrace existing bipartisan legislation to actually fix the problem republicans put forth a woefully inadequate proposal that would require law enforcement and courts to grapple with unworkable processes unreachable standards to be completed in an unreasonably short period of time their bill would allow suspected terrorists to receive firearms by default after only 3 days if the court is unable to work through a complicated process that is the same flaw that allowed the white supremacist charleston shooter to obtain the weapon that he used to murder nine people at emanuel ame church in other words the bill is totally inadequate now under pressure from their most extreme members republican leaders refuse to even put this bill on the floor what should be on the floor is bipartisan

further undermine a womans right to choose a right that has been constitutionally guaranteed for more than 42 years by roe v wade not only does this bill attempt to politicize womens health and to limit womens access to abortion it would interfere with the sacred doctorpatient relationship and substitute a physicians best judgment with the judgment of a handful of politicians we must not forget that this bill has come to the floor at the same time as the push to defund planned parenthood this attack on a venerable and respected provider of highquality health care would have a devastating impact on women especially women in rural communities lowincome women and women of color and it would deny women access to preventive care lifesaving cancer screenings and family planning services approximately one woman in five has relied on planned parenthood for health care at some point in her lifetime it is a blatant attack on women and families to defund an organization that uses federal funds to prevent abortions and to help families stay healthy and cannot even use federal funding for abortion it would be the saddest of ironies that by defunding planned parenthoods critical contraception and other reproductive health services in the name of opposing abortion we would see more unintended pregnancies and therefore more abortions among its flaws h r 3504 proposes a standard of care for abortion providers that could interfere with the ability of physicians to make medical decisions for their patients in doing so the bill represents an unprecedented level of intrusion by the government into medical decisions for instance the bill requires an abortion provider to immediately transport a fetus to a hospital in some cases even if the fetus is not viable under existing law and under the standards of care applicable to neonatal physicians this requirement is so broad and the penalties so severeup to 5 years in prisonthat one can only conclude that the real purpose of the bill is to intimidate abortion providers out of service the bill also requires doctors and employees of hospitals and clinics that provide abortion services to report any violations of the bills standard of care to state or federal law enforcement authorities any person who fails to comply with these requirements is threatened with fines and up to 5 years in prison this is not just the doctors but the cleaning crew and the receptionists on top of this the language in this bill completely fails to distinguish between a viable and nonviable fetus which is the constitutional line that separates abortions that may be performed without restrictions from those that may be regulated or prohibited the bills vague and broad mandates combined with severe penalties will effectively intimidate doctors and ultimately drive them away from the abortion practice which appears to be the true intent of this troubling bill this is why so many organizations are opposed to this bill those like the national womens law center the aauw the aclu and physicians for reproductive choice and health in fact the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists which represents 58 000 physicians opposes h r 3504 because it represents a gross interference in the practice of medicine inserting a politician between a woman and her doctor by intimidating doctors and thereby making abortion unavailable as a practical matter abortion opponents seek to accomplish in fact what they have not accomplished in the courts or in public opinion simply put h r 3504 is yet another attack on womens health and rights when the bornalive infant protection act or baipa became law 13 years ago the bills sponsors clarified that the law was not intended to affect abortion practice or a womans right to choose we did not want to constrain or chill medical decisions regarding patient care that is why judiciary committee democrats voted to support it the bill before us today appears to

whether it is something that i can support i strongly believe in encouraging employee ownership through esops options this bill does part we can do a lot more it is a big thing that we can do to address the increasing income disparities that this country has in making sure that workers can participate in capital formation and capital growth along with owners and executives we look forward to working with the gentleman on that bill and contacting the gentleman as well the gentleman from ohio said that somehow legal operating businesses must have access to banking resources the goal of this bill he said oh wait a minute i mean federal ones not state ones not federal not state this is where you have a difference of course you wont have any disagreement that there is an ambiguity here with regard to types of businesses that are legal at the state level and are not legal federally but this is where you will find that most democrats believe very strongly in states rights most republicans believe here with the exception of the other gentleman from california who just spoke and a number of others who would allow a majority to support this bill but apparently the gentleman from ohio believes in an overarching federal definition telling states what they can and cant do indirectly through the banking system effectively constraining their ability to allow banks to serve businesses that might sell types of firearms that are illegal federally or types of marijuana or hemp or other products that might be illegal federally effectively they are arguing that the federal government should tell them what to do and impose a onesizefitsall solution on states that are as diverse as texas and california and colorado and north dakota i disagree with that premise as do most of the democrats here today we feel that while this body of courseand i agree with the gentlemanshould continue with the discussion about the regulatory structure of legal treatment of cannabis products

businesses that are legal at the state level let me address h r 1675 the encouraging employee ownership act also being named the capital markets improvement act it is a good piece of bipartisan legislation that i think can be made even better through the amendment process title i of this bill which will revise the secs rule 701 by raising and indexing for inflation the threshold under which companies can issue stock to employees without running into government red tape is a commonsense good piece of legislation i hope it is something that most of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree with i am an early cosponsor of this legislation and i think we should promote and applaud the structure the indexation and of course allowing employees to have a stake in their companies that is not the only solution the gentleman from california might have some other ideas i look forward to discussing as do i but if you want to help solve some of our nations issues with income inequality and the wealth gap then we should applaud and promote companies that incorporate employee stock or option ownership whether you issue stock in the manner under this bill or whether you operate in esop or any of the other forms that allow workers to benefit from the growth of your company we should find ways to work together to promote and encourage this style of corporate governance title ii is a safe harbor for investment research a bill that will help improve available market information for investors and something that has broad bipartisan support i know my colleague from delaware will also be pleased to see this pass as an original sponsor my colleague from ohio who is a cochair with me of the congressional caucus for middle market growth spoke yesterday and today about how this overall package of legislation will help grow companies in the allimportant middle market this is main street america these are companies that might not be big enough to be multinational multibilliondollar brand names and they are not startups or small companies but it is the engine of our economy the portion of the market that is a vital piece of our economic engine creating jobs on main street title iii of this bill will work to reduce red tape for these very middle market companies these provisions have broad bipartisan support and i applaud them the sec has largely agreed with this in fact the only argument against it has been we already do this and i think that is a weak argument because we ought to put it in statute the sec has agreed and has taken action but unfortunately some of their actions have added in some increased investor impediments as well i hope the administration can work with congress to improve this bill if there are specific issues they have with it but the bill is necessary it is better to fix things in statute i think that we can work together to reduce red tape to grow small and middlesized companies title v of the bill is another bipartisan piece of legislation that is in line with the sort of regulatory review that we already ask in many agencies it is the sort of good government legislation i think both sides of the aisle can find agreement on and hopefully support now title iv of h r 1675 unfortunately is a bit of a step in the wrong direction and it is something we discussed extensively in the committee yesterday fortunately for this provision there was an open process mr issa and mr ellison have amendments that will be considered that improve the portion of the bill or remove it entirely unfortunately the bill as written is a move away from searchable financial reporting that can be done digitally it is a step away from sortable and downloadable formats it is a return to the pen and paper and inefficient world of the 20th century rather than a step forward to the open data transparency world of the 21st century across the board market participants investors and regulators want information that is already requiredwe are not talking about any new requirementsinformation that is already required financial information to simply be available in a digital searchable format that is all we seek to preserve and not eliminate it is an odd and outdated use of government resources to deal with this information by hand by pen by paper it puts investors and others at an enormous disadvantage and it prevents and reduces the amount of information in the marketplace searchable and sortable data can be better used to track trends find anomalies find investment opportunities and help regulators notice trouble spots in markets and hopefully catch the next enron before it explodes just as importantly investors need information so do entrepreneurial folks who want to take this information and package it in new and interesting and exciting ways and sell it on to institutional and individual investors we heard yesterday from detractors who said investors arent asking for this information we also heard that the committee didnt include any investors in their testimony they only included operating companies i am not sure who they are speaking for but in my conversations i have never heard any investor say i want less information or i want information to be harder to search or find no investor says i want to know less about a companys earnings i want it to be in an archaic pen and paper format that argument that this information isnt welcome by investors is simply incorrect and it is counter to anything you will ever hear from anyone in the investment community hopefully we will fix these issues

does address a very important issue and that is the inexcusable actions of operation choke point which at best could be described as an overzealous use of the department of justices power or at worst as a pernicious attempt to root out activities that are determined to be politically unpopular unfortunately as we examine this bill it looks like it has some unintended consequences which are not addressed through the amendment process the amendment process also fails to include a simple amendment that would further the goals of this bill with regard to the regulated marijuana industry in 22 states i hope that we can address the operation choke point issue i hope we can prevent this administration and future administrations from engaging having doj engage in this kind of troublesome use of authority to coerce closures of accounts for otherwise legitimate and legal customers of local financial institutions if a bank or credit union has a legal business it is legal in the state they deem it creditworthy they are a good customer and they want to open an account with them they should be able to serve that customer the federal government should not use the bank itself as an intermediary in a dispute if the doj has a dispute with a banks customer that should be resolved between the doj and the customer not the bank i hope that there is groundwork for bipartisan legislation in this area that can ensure that this president and future presidents and the future department of justices do not abuse their authority in this area one reallife everyday issue where this concept comes up of the department of justice and the federal government interfering with the bank working with its legal customer would have been addressed by the perlmutter amendment that i spoke about earlier it is not just a colorado issue frankly if this bill addressed that issue despite it being overarching in other areas i would probably support it thus is the importance of this issue from local law enforcement in our state but unfortunately not even a minute not even a second of debate is allowed on the issue the gentleman from ohio claimed that we were having that debate to be clear we are not we are debating the underlying rule there is no time for the sponsors of the amendment to make their case or for opponents of the amendment to make their case we are outlaying the time for other amendments many amendments have 10 minutes many amendments have more there is not even a second for the debate of that amendment sponsored by mr perlmutter that is why i cannot support this rule 213 million americans live in a state or jurisdiction where the voters have allowed for some legal marijuana use colorado tried to solve the problem locally but we were rejected by federal banking regulators in courts so congress needs to be the one to make this change only congress can address this issue while there remains a need to align federal and state laws while the doj and treasury have issued some guidance some institutions are providing banking services to the doj and treasury guidance issues the guidance does not solve the problem which is why we need to change the law and provide certainty which this very simple amendment that has bipartisan support and likely would have passed on the floor would have done but it is completely shut down under this rule even though it furthers the actual goal of the legislation is germane to the legislation is consistent with the legislation and yet it is completely shut down in a closed process that runs contrary to the

chairman mccaul of the homeland security committee i am a cosponsor of this legislation and i supported it in the house foreign affairs committee which considered the bill on february 24 and voted it out by voice unanimously with no opposition it is also my understanding that the bill also passed unanimously in the committee on homeland security as the chairman of our committee explained this legislation authorizes the state department and the department of homeland security to develop opensource versions of software that vets travelers against terrorist watch lists and law enforcement databases once the software is developed we will be able to share it with our allies and multilateral organizations involved in police work such as interpol that means that we will have better software in the hands of worldwide law enforcement sooner and it will be interoperable as things stand now we do not have a comprehensive global database for identifying and tracking terrorists as the bipartisan task force on combating terrorist and foreign fighter travel which was established by chairman mccaul and the committee on homeland security highlighted in its september 2015 report countries including the united states rely on a patchwork system for swapping extremist identities increasing the odds foreign fighters will slip through the cracks the paris and brussels terrorist attacks demonstrate the need for a global system since those tragedies there has been finger pointing about missed intelligence and criticism over the lack of information sharing across borders just in february europol warned that more than 5 000 europeans with european passports had traveled to isis and syria to become isis fighters in late march european security officials told the associated press that the islamic state group had trained at least 400 attackers and sent them to europe to carry out specific attacks of course we have a visa waiver relationship with most of europe and that means these european passport holders will be able to visit the united states without special vetting by our officials there is an exception to that for those european passports that have been stamped indicating they visited syria or iraq this should not give us a whole lot of false security because typically foreign fighters who want to join isis travel to turkey where their passport is stamped with a turkish stamp and then they sneak into isiscontrolled areas isis does not stamp their passport entry into the islamic state so the passports of these europeans that have gone to fight for isis in iraq and syria do not bear a syrian or iraqi stamp in addition if for some reason they did bear such a stamp any european can simply go and ask for a replacement passport and in most cases there will be no record available to the united states that this person had ever visited syria or iraq so we need a system that gives us the best possible opportunity to identify foreign fighters but especially those who hold european passports if we are going to fight and prevent global terrorism in tandem with other countries the united states and our allies must be on the same page when it comes to vetting travelers and tracking wouldbe terrorists this legislation helps us do just that i urge my colleagues to support h r i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.8816365748643875,

for all of his hard work on behalf of the victims of human trafficking i am also very pleased to have the opportunity to partner with my good friend congresswoman ann wagner of missouri who is my classmate and a friend we share the same priority of eradicating human trafficking it is kind of odd as judge poe talked about his relationship with carolyn maloney they are two people who seem on paper very different one might say the same about ann wagner and me but there is that common thread that puts us together to not only advocate and fight for something that we need to fight for but we have been able to make a difference that is why i come to the house floor this evening to recognize and celebrate a very important anniversary the 1year anniversary of bipartisan comprehensive legislation justice for victims of trafficking act that was signed into law the justice for victims of trafficking act or jvta was a landmark bill as you have heard that updated americas effort to combat the scourge of human trafficking and provided essential resources to survivors and law enforcement officials i am so proud to have had my bill be included in this legislation and to have been able to take part in its drafting passage and enactment in the year since jvtas enactment we have witnessed important achievements for example the jvta has reinvigorated americans commitment to protecting our children from cruel exploitation and these children still need our protection human trafficking as we have heard is an estimated multibilliondollarayear international enterprise that forces the most at risk among us both here at home and abroad into modernday slavery it is one of the fastest growing crimes in the world according to the united states state department human trafficking is among the worlds top three criminal enterprises it is forced prostitution domestic slavery and forced labor which is why enactment and now the implementation of the jvta is so important we must continue to work to eradicate human trafficking and support the victims in the year since the jvtas enactment we have seen educators law enforcement officials and service providers working together democrats and republicans raising awareness in our communities that human trafficking is not merely an international phenomenon it unfortunately happens all too often in our backyards just as we have heard judge poe talk about t and talk about brooke and the stories could go on and on in fact in my home state of ohio for example each year an estimated 1 000 children become victims of human trafficking and over 3 000 more are at risk ohio is the fifth leading state for human trafficking because of its proximity to waterways that lead to an international border and the 175 interstate that allows anyone to exit the state within 2 hours to almost anywhere lastly i am very thankful for having amazing advocates in ohio for victims of human trafficking like theresa flores the founder of soap save our adolescents from prostitution and state representative teresa fedor a member of the ohio house of representatives who has made a lifetime commitment to working to protect our victims we must remain vigilant in the implementation of jvta as we were when we passed it so every child every woman and man is free from this form of modernday slavery which is why i am proud to have joined judge poe and congresswomen wagner and maloney of new york in leading a letter to united states attorney general loretta lynch supporting the department of justices implementation thus far of the jvta and requesting needed information on what more can be done within the confines of the current law this is what happens when we work together this is a great example of what we can do when democrats

thank my good friends on the other side of the aisle i now understand what the issue is we are talking apples and oranges my friends on the other side of the aisle dont care about the fact that in 2013 18 percent of americans were uninsured in the state of texas 28 percent california 23 percent and georgia 22 percent now we have found that we are at a point where we have lowered that amount and we have lowered the uninsured rate in this country to 11 9 percent those are vulnerable americans and women and families we also dont seem to understand that when our constituents come to us and talk about premiums all we need to do is do the constituency service and kind of assure them and show them the direction into the marketplace because in shopping around you can lower your premium but the real issue is whether or not we care about making sure that those with preexisting conditions can actually get health insurance that those in medicare can actually protect the medicare system and make it insolvent in 2030 instead of 2017 the other question is does this bill even have a plan is there an alternative healthcare plan that the republicans have put in the budget reconciliation no they have not then they want to take away planned parenthood this is not about disliking planned parenthood it is telling women that they do not have a choice to choose their own doctors that is what they are doing when they defund planned parenthood it is apples and oranges they are talking one thing i am talking about saving lives and helping americans keep their health insurance i rise in opposition to h r 3762 the restoring americans healthcare freedom reconciliation act of 2015 in 1949 harry truman became the first sitting president to propose universal healthcare for all americans as part of the fair deal on march 23 2010 president obama aided by a democratic congress delivered on this promise before the enactment of the affordable care act 50 million people in the united states had no health insurance coverage with many losing insurance as a result of the recent recession this is the 62nd vote by the gop since its enactment to end the affordable care act law in 2013 key provisions of the affordable care act began to take effect and have significantly improved the lives of millions of americans in 2013 the states with the highest percentage of uninsured were texas with 28 8 percent louisiana with 24 percent nevada with 23 3 percent california with 23 2 percent florida with 22 8 percent georgia with 22 5 percent arkansas with 21 9 percent mississippi with 21 7 percent and oklahoma with 21 4 percent in 2013 when gallup first began tracking health insurance coverage just before the affordable care act went into effect the number of persons not insured has declined by 5 2 points gallup reported that the percentage of uninsured americans increased from nearly 14 percent in 2008 to over 17 percent in 2011 and peaked at 18 0 percent in 2013 according to gallup the uninsured rate among unitedstates adults declined to 11 9 percent for the first quarter of 2015 but this fact has not deterred efforts by the gop of the house to end this important lifesaving law this steady decline in the number of americans without health insurance means that today only about 10 percent of our citizens do not have coverage many of those most in need of the healthcare coverage provided by the affordable care act live in the districts of many members on both sides of this argument texas my own state leads the list of states with the highest percentages of uninsured residents the highest concentrations of the uninsured are the poor and unemployed the uninsured rate among americans has dropped sharply since the implementation of the affordable care act which provides access to healthcare to the poor through expansion of medicaid prevents health insurance companies from denying healthcare coverage based on preexisting conditions stops health insurance companies from discriminating against women by charging them higher rates for coverage and extends the time children can remain on their parents health insurance to age 26 the affordable care act provides to states at no cost options for residents to enroll in healthcare programs through medicaid unfortunately some states like my state of texas have rejected this important component of the affordable care act for those in the state in most need of healthcare instead of focusing on protecting and caring for the health of our constituents we are allowing partisan games to interfere with serving the best interest of our districts at the end of healthcare insurance enrollment for 2015 more than 8 5 million consumers signedup for health coverage through the healthcare gov platform or had their coverage automatically renewed of the about 6 million marketplace consumers whose coverage was renewed about 3 6 million actively renewed and 2 4 million consumers automatically renewed their health insurance coverage the 2015 health insurance enrollment period had 29 percent new participants and 71 percent return participants in my state of texas 1 096 868 individual plans were selected by visitors to the healthcare gov platform in 2015 unfortunately texas remains the state with the highest health uninsured rate among the 50 states with 25 7 percent or over 4 2 million residents without health insurance instead of focusing on the issues that the american people want addressed we are having the same discussion to repeal the affordable care act in the efforts of my colleagues to repeal obstruct and undermine this law what is even more frustrating is that while there is so much energy in trying to repeal the affordable care act there has been no plan or suggestions posed on how to replace it i want to once again highlight the benefits of the affordable care act so we can once and for all end the attempts to try and repeal this law that benefits so many americans because of the affordable care act americans are seeing lower costs better coverage and patient protections that republicans want to repeal the average premium for employerprovided family health coverage went up 3 percent in 2014 continuing the trend of lower annual increase which means that over the 5 years the healthcare law has been in place it has saved employers over 1 800 dollars in premiums for employee family health insurance coverage medicare spending growth per beneficiary was approximately flat in fiscal year 2014 a significant contributor to extending the solvency of the program the medicare trustee now projects because of the affordable care act that the medicare trust fund will be solvent until 2030 instead of health insurance consumers have saved 9 billion since 2011 because obamacare requires insurance companies to spend 80 cents on every premium dollar on consumer healthcare and empowers states to review and negotiate premium increases 129 million americans including 17 million children are no longer at risk of losing health insurance coverage because of their health 76 million americans with private coverage are eligible for expanded preventative services coverage which includes 30 million women and 18 million children since the affordable care act went into effect insurers have paid customers over 1 9 billion in rebates because they did not spend 80 cents on each dollar of premium on healthcare nationwide nearly 11 7 million consumers selected a plan or were automatically enrolled in marketplace coverage in 2014 of the 5 million uninsured texans 874 000 are eligible for medicaid chip 1 046 000 are in the coverage gap 1 756 000 are eligible for tax credits 1 264 000 are ineligible because of their income or access to employer benefits in 2014 access to affordable healthcare for the selfemployed or those who decide to purchase their own coverage became easier because of affordable insurance exchanges in texas 1 205 174 consumers selected or were automatically reenrolled in quality affordable health insurance coverage through the marketplace as of february 2015 the federal marketplace signups and tax credits in texas meant that 85 percent of texas consumers who were signed up qualified for an average tax credit of 239 per month through the marketplace 68 percent of texas marketplace enrollees obtained coverage for 100 or less after any applicable tax credits in 2015 and 92 percent had the option of doing so in texas consumers could choose from 15 issuers in the marketplace in 2015up from 12 in 2014 texas consumers could choose from

am going to oppose this bill because i think it rolls back too many investor protections but i understand and appreciate the chairmans goals here we all support the goal of increasing capital formation we just disagree on the best way to accomplish it my view is that the best way to stimulate investment is to treat investors well and protect them and that means strong investor protections i firmly believe that markets run more and better on confidence than on capital unfortunately this bill goes in the wrong direction it strips away protections that investors want in order to feel comfortable investing in startups and small companies i have particular concerns with title i of this bill which would allow very small and thinly traded companies to sell securities using the faster shelf registration process this raises serious market manipulation concerns let me explain why shelf registration allows companies to register securities in advance and then sell them later on short notice without getting sec approval traditionally shelf registration has been limited to larger wellknown companies like ge or apple that are already widely followed by the markets in other words companies that investors are already very familiar with in 2007 the sec decided to expand the number of companies who are eligible to use shelf registration in doing so however the sec was very careful to balance this against the need to maintain strong investor protection the sec was comfortable allowing certain very small companies to have a limited ability to use shelf registration to offer securities but only on the condition that the company have at least one class of securities listed on the exchange this was because the exchanges have their own standards that companies must meet in order to get their securities listed on the exchange these listing standards provide investors with sufficient assurance that the company is legitimate has a reasonably wide investor base and will have enough trading interest to assure a reasonable amount of liquidity in the stock without the comfort provided by the exchanges initial screening procedures for these companies however i am not sure we should be comfortable allowing these very small companies to use shelf registration but that is what this bill would do it would allow very small companies that trade in overthecounter markets to sell securities using shelf registration allowing a small company whose stock is very thinly traded to quickly sell a large amount of securities under the shelf registration raises real concerns about potential market manipulation a company could easily bid up the price of its stock and then immediately dump a large amount of new stock to investors at the artificially inflated prices as columbia professor john coffee noted in his testimony before the financial services committee on this proposal last congress letting a small company with a modest 50 million public float use shelf

include the restoration of riverside and wetland habitats the construction of fish passages and improving spawning and nursery habitats a critical part of this program is that it requires a 35 percent

next years budget requestactually listen to us i want to thank chair simpson and ranking member kaptur for their work on this legislation and for their support on this issue i would urge my colleagues to support our great lakes to support our fish and to support this bipartisan effort i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.002245187759399414, 0.5022451877593994, 0, "when our founders wrote the constitution they had the wisdom to create a system of checks and balances among the three branches of government they knew this would limit power protect against abuses and promote liberty under our constitution the president has the right to nominate justices to the supreme court but one house of the congress the senate has the coequal right to consent to such an appointment one branch has a power another has a check today with a vacancy on the supreme court we have a chance to see this system of checks and balances in action in deciding whether to consent to an appointment to the supreme court the senate should assess whether the president has been acting consistent with the constitution the chart to my left highlights just a few of president obamas unconstitutional actions since he was reelected in 2012 these actions have been frequent repeated and grave these actions have poisoned the well of deliberation for any appointment by this president in that light why wouldnt the senate withhold consent it is a game the president chose to play and withholding consent to his appointment is an appropriate consequence"], [0.0024181902408599854, 0.49758180975914, 1, "the gentleman from texas is imminently correct we are friends i say it in the sincerest way as well he and i have collaborated on many issues and we have gotten a lot of things done in congress i hope that doesnt hurt him back home letting people know that we have worked on things together but obviously i have a different perch and from my perch here is what i see i see an opportunity for additional credit scoring to be used and if it is negative it is not going to benefit the person that is being scored it does not prevent any other negative information from being properly scored it simply says that hud may use this information indicating that persons have paid a light bill gas bill water bill or phone bill as additional information that is all it says that it may do this and it may create the scoring now with reference to hud hud has given me an indicationand i dont have it in writing to hand to you but i believe you would trust my wordthat they are not opposing this one of the reasons why it wasnt done previously was a function of huds budget i believe this to be the reason and because of budgetary concerns it did not get doneit was codified in the lawand that is why i am reintroducing it but this is a milder version of what i introduced previously because previously we said hud shall do this and this time we have made it as mild as possible the realtors are very much supportive of it this will give 50 million people who are currently with light credit files dont have sufficient credit scores to have some additional information to be considered but it does not in any way require that negative information be received in a positive manner if it is negative it remains negative if you havent paid your car note it is still a negative if you havent paid your light bill gas bill or water bill it is still a negative it only gives the opportunity to add these other things as things to consider for many people who quite frankly dont have a lot of traditional credit they dont have bad credit they just dont have traditional credit there are a lot of my constituents who fall into this category i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
