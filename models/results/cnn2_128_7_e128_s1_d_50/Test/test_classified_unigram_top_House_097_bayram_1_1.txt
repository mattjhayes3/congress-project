crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski president polishamerican congress the honorable francis j meehan ambassador to poland the honorable william wilson the presidents personal envoy to the holy see and peter s bridges director eastern

of detroit who was accompanied by the reverend stanley milewski chancellor of orchard lake schools orchard lake mich mrs helen zielinska president of the polish womens alliance and mr joseph drobot president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent solution to its most difficult internal problems"], [0.0014126547612249851, 0.0014126547612249851,

never to be used but only for deterrence but the supporting documents for this military budget fiscal year 1983 say we must have the capacity to fight to survive and win a nuclear war anyone who believes we can fight survive and win a nuclear war bydefinition with all due respect is psychotic every analyst i have seen indicates that no one wins in a nuclear war there is no such as a limited war a surgical strike where 20 to 100 million human beings are dead what is limited and surgical about that i would quote dr geiger the executive director of the physicians for social responsibility

went up to 226 billion 25 percent over and above that is incredible we must remember that ronald reagan stomped us in 1982 and put the military budget at an incredible level so let me give the members these figures because it also includes the black caucus budget when you go back to 1981 as a base 1982 which was terribly out of line the jones budget if we use 1981 figures calls for 32 9percent

for extramural research an area slated for drastic cuts by administration thereby allowing the agency to draw upon qualified creative experts outside epa who can assist in solving environmental

shortwave broadcasts over their am network because they know that is the way to reach their people so the argument that the cuban people can be effectively reached through shortwave broadcasts is a falacious argument as far as the 500kilowatt transmitters are concerned i think the gentleman in the well is right we have to decide first and foremost who is making the decisions in this country with respect to our foreign policy i think we have to bear that clearly in mind then we need to point out the fact that the castro government for years has sought to double its broadcasting capacity the two 500kilowatt stations are part of this plan they were laid on the plate several years ago it has got nothing to do with radio marti that decision by the castro government has been used by the

hate to do that to your ego but i can guarantee you that he is not going to worry about iowa if he is really going to get nasty he is going to go after somebody else now as far as jamming is concerned it is a lot cheaper to jam in cuba to prevent cubans from listening than it is to jam in the united states they are not going to jam the transmitter they are going to jam the receiver that is what they would be more likely to do for that purpose it does not make any difference whether you have short wave long wave medium wave or any other wave you can jam but the ultimate thing regarding this

opposition to this amendment is founded on sound principles of fiscal responisibility and wha i consider after a year and a half of intense study on the space subcommittee to be in the best interests of our civilian space program our telecommunications industry and our national security to begin let me offer a bit of pertinent upperstage history last year the space science subcommittee as you have heard directed nasa and the defense department to conduct a joint study to determine our needs for a high energy upper stage this is that study upper stage alternatives for the shuttle era a nasadod report to congress we have had it for over a year the study concluded that nasa should begin developing a centaur for space shuttle use since the reports completion nothing significantly has changed to warrant deleting centaur from nasas budget in fact on page 81 of this report that we commissioned it specifically rejects the end effect of the flippo amendment namely an ius galileo combined mission fortunately the president accepted the urgent supplemental last july 18 and sustained the funding for the centaur high energy upper stage integration into the shuttle the presidents acceptance is consistent with nasas 1982 authorization and appropriation bills and recognizes the technical superiority of centaur as well as the fact that centaur integration obviates the need for an otherwise redundant 1 to 11 billion for an air force high energy stage program for military and intelligence uses which we will have need for in the 1987 timeframe i would like to briefly outline four compelling reasons why the house should support the nasa air force recommendations and reject the flippo amendment first ius cannot meet our high energy upper stage requirements for nasa dod and commercial missions beyond the 198586 timeframe our high priority space missions are increasingly finding weight to be a limiting factor the ius can currently lift only 5 000 pounds compared to the 10 000 to 14 000 pounds provided by centaur second the failure to move decisively now to develop a high energy upper stage for shuttle will result in an increasing loss of business to foreign competition specifically the french ariane the ariane vehicle will lift approximately 9 500 pounds to geosynchronous orbit by 198687 thus exceeding ius capabilities without centaur the united states will lose this commercial market third development of a new high energy upper stage coupled with the decision to fly galileo and the international solar polar mission with an ius will cost taxpayers at least 700 million to 800 million more than centaur take at least 2 years longer to complete and yield no significant performance improvement indeed it has been estimated that a brandnew stage as i say will cost between 1 and 1 billion and will basically involve reinventing the centaur fourth and finally launching galileo and solar polar on centaur has a number of critical advantages over using ius for these missions centaur would provide a flight time of 26 months for nasas galileo mission and would guarantee 11 satellite encounters compared to a flight time of more than double 54 months and 6 satellite encounters for an ius launch plus the increased risk of the increased time in the case of solar polar centaur restores the maximum possible mission as well as nasas credibility with its foreign partners most notably the european space agency it is very likely that another change in launch vehicles will cause our international friends to question our resolve and ultimately conclude
