district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio programs historically black colleges and universities and community technology centers in an age of unprecedented wealth the cbc has the vision to invest in the american family and not squander opportunities afforded by a budget surplus i will not support the failed policies of the past senator mccain has best characterized this budget resolution as one that is fiscally irresponsible i support a budget that invest strengthening social security provides an affordable prescription drug benefit for all seniors helps communities improve public education with quality teachers smaller classes greater accountability and modem schools and pay down the national debt these are the policies that invest in our children and in the future of our nation in the 21st century"],

from texas and the gentleman from california for their leadership on a crucial and devastating fact of life for our seniors in america it is important to note that those of us who have worked on this issue believe that this is the congress to get it through i am delighted that as an original cosponsor of this legislation for this congress i again stand up to be counted as i did in the 105th congress i do that for the many constituents that i represent in fact allow me to share the story of a husband and wife from my district in houston written to me just a few days ago in january these individuals retired having worked in our school system educating our young people and now in their retirement they are pleading for relief because presently they are spending an average of 4 792 annually on drugs paid by a texas teachers retirement income and social security onefifth of their income is used to pay for prescription drugs i would simply say this has got to stop that means that these senior citizens who have worked all of their life who in fact have a commitment to being part of the engine of this economy for many many years are now having to sacrifice the meager income that they have and to make choices as my good colleague indicated between room and board and health the prescription drug fairness for seniors act is not a giveaway it does not interfere with competitiveness as my pharmaceutical friends have said it does not do damage to the marketplace as they have attacked us so readily what it does is it simply tries to emphasize fairness pharmacies will now be able to purchase prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries at the same low prices available to the federal government such as the federal supply schedule price or the medicaid price since drug prices presently paid by the federal government are approximately half the retail prices paid by senior citizens participating pharmacies will be able to pass on large cost savings to senior citizens i know that my good friend the gentleman from arkansas has been in his district and has seen the sincerity expressed by seniors who have said they do not want a handout but after we have given them the option of medicare why shouldnt medicare have the same ability to be able to purchase low priced pharmaceuticals competitively priced equal to that of the hmos has anyone ever been in the midst of seniors maybe those who are a little older in their seventies and eighties and heard them plead to us for clarity about these hmos who am i to pick what are they giving me the confusion abounds and yet now we have promoted these hmos over medicare that has been so helpful in providing good health care for our seniors and we have given hmos the upper edge by providing these incentives and yet sometimes seniors are moved from one hmo to the next it shuts down and they get letters and it is confusing oh yes i believe that hmos provide a viable service but those who are on medicare should not be deprived the ability to get lowpriced prescription drugs and to have a fairness process in place so i believe that we are in fact providing what the constitution says we should have and that is equality and we are doing it for a population that is now suffering they suffer because of the way pharmacies are doing business and many americans whose retirement plans rely in part on private pension plans are also struggling this is because many of those plans which were designed decades ago do not contain comprehensive medical plans and even the ones that do include medical insurance typically do not pay for medication in fact i have talked to senior citizens who have said i am going to get that mail order program because i have heard that if you do mail order that you can get cheap prescription drugs so i think it is important that this legislation not have one moment of a slow process it should be expedited it should go through the committees of jurisdiction with flying colors we should respond to the tragedy of senior citizens having to make choices between what they will buy whether they will pay for food for the evening meal or which meal they will escape or not be able to have so that they can get the necessary prescriptions i will just simply say as we work together on this legislation tears have come to my eyes when i have met with senior citizens who first of all are grateful for life gratified for the medical care that many of them have been able to access but when they give me the list of prescriptions that they have to take every single day they do not do it in anger they just simply say we have got to take it but give us a reprieve help us not to be have to choose one over the other so i want to thank the gentleman as i close i want to just make a personal note that from my home district in addition to these prescription drugs i am gratified for the medical health system of which we also need to look at with the patients bill of rights access to medical care i am grateful for the system that is in my community the public hospital system now under attack by county government my commitment to the senior citizens of that community the children of that community is to say that i am going to fight for this legislation the prescription drug fairness for seniors act as well as a patients bill of rights as well as fighting for lois morris our health care director in harris county and fight against anybody who would move to shut it down or to deprive our citizens of good health care by cutting the budget i want to thank my friend the gentleman from arkansas i want to thank my good friends the gentleman from maine the gentleman from texas and the gentleman from california"], [0.0015497207641601562, 0.9984502792358398,

to emphasize that these are just not facts and figures but real people the 2000 census is just around the corner and if we do not stop the partisan rhetoric which has clouded this issue for far too long we will once again keep millions of americans from having a voice as chair of the census and civil rights task force for the hispanic caucus and cochair of the census task force for the democratic caucus i am committed to achieving a fair and accurate census the impact of a fair and accurate census will be felt across the nation in every community and in the lives of every american the information gathered in the census is utilized in many ways it is used by states and local governments to plan schools and highways by the federal government to distribute funds for health care and countless other programs it is used by businesses in creating their own economic plans our last census in 1990 was the first time in history that the count was less accurate than the one before in 1990 more than 8 million americans were not counted and more than 4 million were counted twice in texas as already indicated over 500 000 were not counted in my own home city of san antonio as referredto earlier 40 000 were not counted in a report released by the general accounting office this past week it is reported that 22 of the 25 large formula grant programs use census data as part of their allocation formula those 25 formula grant programs distribute approximately 166 billion in federal funds to the states the 22 formula grant programs that utilize census data account for 97 percent of the total that is 161 billion these are federal tax dollars that citizens across the nation have paid federal dollars that should come back to the community in the form of improved infrastructure better neighborhood schools health care for the poor and the elderly local economic development and much more in my state of texas where over 500 000 were not counted it is estimated that we lost close to 1 billion in federal funding over the past 10 years we were second only to california in the harm caused by an inaccurate count this astronomical loss of funding breaks down to 1 992 per missed person it is estimated that if we utilize the same inaccurate enumeration methods for the 2000 census texas will stand to lose 2 18 billion in federal funds we must realize that this is not a political issue this is an economic issue it is an education issue it is an infrastructure issue and most importantly it is about fairness it is about time that we stop the partisan rhetoric and choose people over party politics every person in this nation counts and every american deserves to be counted it is important to point out exactly who was missed in the 1990 census it is really no surprise because the very people who were not counted in the last census are those communities who are typically overlooked of the 8 million americans not counted minorities children and the poor were disproportionately represented nationally 5 percent of hispanics 4 4 percent of african americans 2 3 percent of asian and pacific islanders and over 12 percent of native americans living on reservations were undercounted in texas the net undercount from the 1990 census was 2 8 percent almost twice as high than the national average of 1 6 percent the percentage of hispanics and children missed in texas were all greater than the national average of the 500 000 texans missed over half were of hispanic origin statewide 3 9 percent of african americans 2 6 percent of asian and pacific islanders and 2 8 percent of native americans were undercounted while missing or miscounting people is a problem for the census the fact that particular groups children the poor people of color city dwellers and renters were missed more often than others produced census data that underrepresented these particular groups each of us should be outraged by these types of inaccuracies the census bureau and other experts have told us that the most accurate census can be obtained by utilizing modern and proven scientific statistical methods these are proven methods proven to be the most accurate system to obtain the census now we know that the constitution calls for an enumeration i agree we should try to count as many people as we possibly can i also realize the obstacles that face us if we rely on this head count alone today society is highly mobile most households are twoincome families there are language barriers and there are people who have a distrust of government these are just some of the obstacles facing us if we choose to continue to employ a head count system alone proven scientific statistical methods can overcome these obstacles and will give us the more accurate count over and above the accuracy we know that this system is cheaper than the actual head count the supreme court recently ruled that these scientific methods can only be used for redistricting and distribution of federal funds and that a head count must be done for the purpose of apportionment if we know we can get the most accurate census through these methods and that they will save us money we must utilize them the gentlewoman from new york who just preceded me has introduced legislation that will amend the census act so that scientifically proven statistical methods can be used for every purpose of the census apportionment redistricting and distribution of federal dollars i believe in this bill and urge all of my colleagues to support it so that every american will be counted and have a voice we must stop the partisan bickering over the census we must put people first we must put people over party politics we must and should be dedicated to obtaining a fair

the issue of funding in our community african americans and other minorities continue to suffer a drastically higher rate of death and disease and longer term rates of illnesses from treatable diseases than other segments of the u s population as our nation prepares to enter the new millennium this negative health status must not continue to be ignored as the nation spends over 7 billion for hivaids treatment prevention and control only 156 million is targeted to address hivaids in communities of color a mere 2 percent surely steps must be taken and effective measures put in place to ensure that resources follow the trend of the disease across all segments of this population we are asking for a minimum of 349 million to appropriate in fiscal year 2000 to address this health emergency in communities of color i started an aids walk in the southern california area because of the devastation of this disease both domestically and now internationally in africa brazil asia and latin america in looking at it from the domestic side of things according to the centers for disease control as of june 1997 32 4 percent of all males age 13 and older are african americans and 14 8 percent are hispanic of all females age 13 and older 24 2 percent are caucasians 58 4 percent are african americans and 16 4 percent are latinos or hispanics of all children under the age of 13 years old 60 8 percent are african americans and 19 5 percent are hispanic you can see this very devastating disease has impacted the minority women and children tremendously with this being the leading cause of death among african american women ages 25 to 44 right in those reproductive years we can ill afford to let this continue we must raise the awareness of this devastation domestically with african americans making up 13 percent of the unitedstates population and hispanics making up 11 percent of the unitedstates population these percentages signal an alarming and inhumane quandary for all americans we the members of congress are in a position to impact the lives of americas families struggling to lead healthy productive lives we can serve an integral role in educating parents teens and members of our communities on hiv how it is transmitted what treatment options exist for those who are living with hiv the need to obtain hiv testing and the clarification of rampant myths associated with the disease that for so long has been exclusively associated with homosexual white males now hiv as i have just read to you is devastating domestically but this disease is also devastating africa by large numbers presently there are nearly 23 million adults and children living with hiv aids on that great continent according to unesco aids is now africas leading cause of death please hear me and those in the outer communities it is the leading cause of death here domestically among african american women ages 25 to 44 and it is the leading cause of death on the continent of africa with prevalence rates reaching 25 percent of all adults in some countries the epidemic is decimating the pool of skilled workers managers and professionals who make up the human capital to grow africas democracies and economies while the hiv aids disease continues to devastate women domestically and throughout africa and finding a cure seems far into the future we cannot afford to give up the congressional black caucus will not give up we are calling on all americans of good will not to give up we are calling on our african sisters and brothers not to give up there are many things that we can do as world citizens to help address the myriad problems associated with the hiv aids epidemic education programs in the workplace schools and churches can help create new attitudes toward gender and aids transmission womens health services that include treatment testing and counseling prevention and support services can greatly empower women as they combat this disease while caring for their children we must support the cause of a comprehensive program for african american latino and asian women and the entire minority population in testing education in schools and

some kind of a perspective first of all let me mention that we are going to be gone from here within the next few days we do not know how many more days there will continue to be the deliberation on the budget but the fact is that if we do have an opportunity after the republican leadership has been fighting tooth and nail more cops on the beat more teachers reduced class size if in fact there are some gains in that area we will feel vindicated and we will be very very pleased they are important victories for working families that is what we want to do that is why we come here we want to try and protect those vital priorities but that leads me to say that one has to take a look at why we are here each of us comes as a direct result of elections people cast their votes and they say frank pallone of new jersey rosa delauro of connecticut of the third district we think you will do a good job on our behalf each of the 435 members who comes here has that kind of trust it is a responsibility as well as an opportunity what we try to do is to take very seriously that responsibility those obligations and try to reflect the will of the people in this body it is the peoples house but the kinds of issues that you have talked about the health issues and as you go through the list of the unfinished business and whether it is hmo reform or prescription drugs or gun safety or minimum wage social security or medicare in each of these areas we know that the public is clamoring for some kind of relief if it is on hmo reform they are desperate to get back to doctors and patients and themselves making their medical decisions they are desperate and clamoring for the notion that my gosh if something goes terribly wrong with a course of medical action that has been if you will prescribed by an hmo that they in fact cannot get any accountability any relief they have no place to go they worry about that for themselves and their families you mentioned prescription drugs you know and i know that people are making those hard decisions every day as to whether or not to fill their prescriptions or buy food because the cost of prescription drugs continues to escalate gun safety we know that it is now 7 months since columbine that terrible tragic case and there have been subsequent tragedies and yet modest gun safety legislation cannot seem to see the light of day when we have parents and children saying help us to make our communities safe minimum wage we are at a time in this country over the last 10 years where chief executive officers of corporations have seen their wages escalate 481 percent over the last 10 years in fact workers have seen only a 28 percent increase and quite frankly if workers salaries had gone up as much as the ceo salaries the minimum wage would be roughly about 22 people want to raise their standard of living they are working very very hard social security and medicare bedrock programs which have lifted really lifted and provided a retirement future retirement security for so many hardworking men and women in this country these are the issues that people speak to us about these are the issues that they are concerned and worried about this is what they feel that they have given us their trust to do something about yet there is a hard core minority within the majority party within the republican party here that has said no to these pieces of legislation when there has been real bipartisan support as you know hmo reform campaign finance reform which i did not mention but there were bipartisan gun safety measures in the senate if this were just onesided you might say that my gosh all these folks on the democratic side are wrong these are not issues that people care about but in fact it does not make any difference what party you are about what your party identification is prescription drugs hmo reform gun safety minimum wage medicare social security they know no party affiliation people just expect that we are going to do the best we can on their behalf and yet this majority party this republican leadership has bottled these bills up after they had passed in the house after they have real bipartisan support they have said no so they thwart the will of the members who serve here but much much more importantly they thwart the will of the american public it is wrong it really is that is

majority party is it to ensure that all americans have an equal opportunity in this country or is it to prevent that from happening the justice departments civil rights division is the most important weapon we have to fight for equal opportunity through its investigation and prosecution of criminal civil violations violationsof the fair housing and lending laws employment discrimination and other civil rights abuses unfortunately the majority has consistently underfunded this office why this year the administration has asked for 97 9 million and is getting only 86 million from this bill and this is in the midst of a 200 billion budget surplus that is the wrong message to send to the american people about the importance of civil rights this amendment can fix this by fully funding the division with an additional 11 8 million now in the past few years the civil rights division has been more important than ever in pursuing criminal civil rights abuses the nation has experienced the horrors of the torture and deaths of matthew shepard and james byrd and the murder of a reproductive health care provider dr bernard slepian more recently four new york city police officers killed amadou diallo an unarmed immigrant in the lobby of an apartment building and another four officers brutally assaulted abner louima these are just a few of the cases that the division is reviewing the federal bureau of investigation stated that there are 10 461 law enforcement agencies across the united states reporting a staggering total of 8 049 hate crimes in 1998 alone these are conservative numbers though because the truth is many hate crimes go unreported because the victims fear retaliation and many police departments just do not collect such data now while law enforcement offices and agencies pursue the bulk of the offenders the justice department must train those agencies and prosecute those offenders the local officials car not with added funding the civi rights division can hire five just fiv more lawyers and assure that many c these perpetrators are brought to juc tice three prominent civil rights groupe the naacp the aclu and the na tional asian pacific american lega consortium have pointed out in a let ter to the house that one of the mos pressing issues for many americans i that of police misconduct the department has investigated th police departments of washington d c new york city new orleans and lo angeles and many others for numer ous offenses including excessive force prior investigations have led to con sent decrees with local police depart ments including steubenville ohio and pittsburgh pennsylvania foi using excessive force and impropei searches in december 1988 thejustice depart ment was conducting six public inves tigations with eight attorney throughout the country and in december 1999 the department was inves tigating at least 12police department with just the same number of attorneys as the previous year we cannot expect the department tc increase its workload in this mannei without adding additional resources andso this amendment would permit the division to hire three muchneeded attorneys to prosecute police misconduct and so my colleagues i urge my colleagues to support the serranoconyers amendment it adds modest funding to the civil rights division all to oftenthe majority gives our nations civil rightslaws mere lip serviceoffering us civil rights on the cheap the budget before us today confirms my worst fears if you look at the actual evidence in critical areas such as hate crimes police misconduct employment and housing you will see that there is overwhelming evidence of ongoing discrimination in our society yet the budget actually under funds the critical civil rights division to the tune of 11 million consider the problem in hate crimes our nation has only recently began the healing process in the aftermath of the tortures and deaths of james byrd jr and matthew shepard in laramie wyoming in the years 1991 through 1997 there were more than 50 000 hate crimes reported 1 this is why the conyersserrano amendment would allow the division to hire five new attorneys to help prosecute hate crimes and other civil rights crimes the incidence of police misconduct toward minorities is also growing dramatically in pittsburgh a police officer shot to death a black motorist who had slowed down and peered through his side window while observing a drug arrest in riverside california a 19yearold black woman was shot to death by a policeman in her car at agas station and we all know thatamadou diallo a west african immigrant was shot 41 times in the vestibule of his bronx apartment by four police officers at a time when the civil rights division is on the verge of being totally overwhelmed i our amendment would also allow the division il to retain three additional attorneys to fighl against police pattern and practice misof conduct the problem with regard to employment and housing discrimination is no better the number of employment discrimination cases in federal courts has almost tripled between 1 1990 and 1998 from 8 413 complaints to 1 23 735 the

mobility it connects the large astrodome where the republican national convention was held along through some depressed areas along through our museum area the rice university main h3438 coi street as most of our towns have their main street which have fallen upon hard times then into our vibrant downtown area and connecting the university of houston downtown that serves a high population of hispanics and african americans this light rail is a win win circumstance it is a system that has been frugal in its analysis no comment or criticism has come from the department of transportation that this is not a good system no criticism has come that they are overrun with the new executive director and ceo of the metro shirley delibero we brought in a very fine rail professional we know for sure that this rail system will help to generate feeder lines if the community so desires in parts west north south and east reaching to all parts of this metroplex as we have seen the proposal of the light rail we have seen a light come into the area we have seen the beginning of a 27story highrise office building we have seen the work of trammell crow residential which is evaluating from 250 unit multiservice or multifamily housing complex in midtown houston we have seen camden development complete a 337unit apartment project in midtown and mccord development which has two highrise office redevelopment projects underway frankly what i am hoping that as we evidence to this body both democrats and republicans alike although this does not rise to the level of a point of order it is a limitation we ask that this body give respect and credence to a collective group of individuals who have sought only to see a return on their tax dollars and to match the work that has gone on in washington d c that has moved people from place to place seattle washington our sister city dallas texas and many other parts of this nation that have had rail and have seen the pollution come down and people being moved efficiently this city is seeking to have their olympics in 2012 and i know by saying that i might rise the ire of some of the other competing cities but we are working very hard to bring that olympics to the united states of course and certainly to texas and certainly to houston this is a real key component to doing that an economic engine and i do believe that those who may find fault with what has happened in the past in 1991 will come to the realization that they can find no fault in what is going on right now there have been meetings and hearings and there are stakeholders and people are concerned i would ask my colleagues to consider this as we proceed i would have liked to see this amendment come to the end i intend at the conclusion of the debate to withdraw this amendment because i am hoping that we can enter into an abbreviated colloquy to say that we will work together i see the gentleman from texas on the floor of the house i want to work with him but i do want us as a community to be able to move into the 21st century i look forward to my colleagues working with me and the gentleman from texas on this very important issue i rise with my colleague mr bentsen to offer an amendment to section 331 of this bill h r 4475 that would only prevent funding for the planning design or construction of a community supported light rail system in houston texas as a representative for the 18th congressional district in houston i fully support the transit funding that was appropriated for houston and approved by the department of transportation for the light rail project the houston metro was to transfer 65 million in federal funds earmarked for construction of a light rail project in my home city of houston the rest of the 235 million needed would come from local funds slated to build park and ride centers and other projects the light rail project is supported by the houston metro the surrounding congressional districts of congressmen bentsen who is a cosponsor of this amendment gene green lampson doggett and turner the business community the mayor of houston lee p brown and the harris county presiding elected official judge robert eckels this light rail project is a winwin situation for everyone in houston as well as the millions of people who visit every year in that it would attract and focus new development and an economic boom around the station areas and to the economically depressed areas within the city of houston and the 18th congressional district which i represent in fact an independent overview written by the greater houston partnership which includes the houston chamber of commerce houston economic development organization and houston world trade stated that the economic impact of the light rail project in houston would have an estimated incremental development over the 20012020 period ranging from 0 percent to 40 percent the light rail project would also reinvigorate retail sales in downtown houston as well as link the two principal employment centers of houston which is made up of 200 000 employees some of the local businesses that began to plan for the economic boom that the light rail project would bring are century development which started plans to build a 27story high rise office building with a 1 500 space parking garage and 50 000 square feet of retail space trammel crow residential which is evaluating two 250300 unit multifamily housing complex in midtown houston camden development which recently completed a 337 unit apartment project in midtown and mccord development which has two 2 highrise office redevelopment projects underway totaling over 50 million in renovation fees these are only some of the redevelopment that is being implemented as a result of the light rail project in houston which was to receive federal funding houston has also been hit with major concerns about air quality and requirements for improving its air quality through better mobility plans therefore the light rail project for houston is of urgent need to the community the main street light project is welcomed by the residents of houston light rail will help alleviate houstons traffic congestion problem and significantly reduce the number of motorists that presently pollute the air with exhaust the light rail project will play a pivotal role in regional transportation among other benefits the light rail project will service all day transit demand including peak hours it will relieve bus congestion in the urban core as buses from throughout the region currently converge on downtown this project will offer a transportation choice to many area residents who will choose to leave their vehicles at home i will be absolutely opposed to any efforts in the appropriations committee that would hinder or prohibit the timely funding of this urgently needed project i urge my colleagues to support this amendment"], [0.0016567707061767578, 0.9983432292938232,

in strong support of the substitute being offered on our side here we are in washington in the middle of july but one would think with the legislation before us that it is the middle of the winter because we have been hit with a veritable blizzard of large taxcutting measures the closer we get to election day my constituents in western wisconsin honestly know a snowjob when they see it unfortunately i think this is just another of a series of electionyear politics playing politics with future budget surpluses because that is what this debate is really about what is the best priority use of future budget surpluses if in fact they do materialize there is a clear difference between the two parties on this i came to washington with a lot of concern in regards to the 5 7 trillion national debt i am the father of two little boys who are just 4 and 2 and i refuse to support policies that are going to make it more difficult for us to eliminate this legacy of debt that we are due to pass on to future generations unless we have the courage to resist large tax cuts now and use the money for debt reduction and shoring up social security and medicare the series of tax cuts when you put them all together would virtually consume every last cent of projected budget surpluses if in fact they materialize at all there is no guarantee that they will but let us talk for a minute about the policy implications of these series of tax cuts and who better to listen from than the chairman of the federal reserve board chairman greenspan this is basic macroeconomics 101 he has been telling us consistently in his testimony large tax cuts now are bad economic policy because it will overstimulate the economy and force the federal reserve to increase interest rates to slow the economy down that would be detrimental to all citizens who need to make home car credit card student loan or other payments it will also make it more worthy to invest in new capital and create more jobs here are just a couple of statements that chairman greenspan said saving the surpluses if politically feasible is in my judgment the most important fiscal measure we can take at this time to foster continued improvements in productivity another one we probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut immediately largely because it is apparent that the surpluses are doing a great deal of good to the economy perhaps most importantly chairman greenspan said this lawmakers are counting on unpredictable economic trends to continue producing the budget surpluses they need to pay for their tax cuts the longterm forecasts are often inaccurate and lead to vast errors in predicting budget deficits and surpluses you should not commit contingent potential resources to irreversible uses that is exactly what we are doing in these series of tax cuts when you look at them all together go slow we can provide modest tax relief for families who need it but we need to do it in a fiscally responsible way let us not bank our future on projected surpluses that may never materialize let me be clear the house leadership has embarked on a series of tax cuts that will obliterate a surplus that is the hardwon product of nearly 8 years of fiscal discipline taken all the tax cuts offered in this session over two trillion dollars they will consume virtually the entire projected budget surplus in the next 10 years and then explode in the second 10 years now is not the time to abandon responsible budgeting by spending money before it even comes in the door further this bill will leave fewer resources for other priorities within the medicare program including extending the solvency of the medicare trust fund creating a medicare prescription drug coverage benefit investing in education and providing relief to rural hospitals and other health care providers i support the substitute to h r 4865 this substitute is fiscally responsible and will provide tax relief for middle income seniors who need the most assistance rather than eliminating the tax for all seniors this proposal sustains the tax on social security benefits for individuals who earn more than 80 000 and for couples eaming more than 100 000 roughly 95 percent of all seniors are covered under the altemative furthermore this substitute will only go into effect those years in which there is enough of an onbudget surplus to replace lost revenues i have always felt that if projected budget surpluses do in fact materialize we have a number of existing obligations that we must meet such as paying off our 5 7 trillion national debt shoring up social security and modernizing medicare with a prescription drug benefit and investing in education these should be our top national priorities before we pass large tax cuts that will benefit the most wealthy and consume the entire projected budget surplus that may or may not materialize if those commitments are given their due priority then fiscally responsible tax relief can be provided to those struggling families trying to make ends meet we must not enact risky tax cuts today that will result in harming our seniors and our children tomorrow i urge my colleagues to vote against this final bill americas seniors are depending on us to balance the needs for tax relief with the need for medicare solvency we can do both in a fiscally responsible

something that should be settled in houston texas but i rise and feel the need to rise to explain what is going on here i have been involved in mobility around houston for 20 years i have been involved in the regional mobility plan and in developing that plan in the 1980s that we are now finishing i am very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build this system in houston should be decided by the whole community as things stand today houstonians cannot make an informed decision because metro does not have a comprehensive light rail system to take to the voters the people of houston cannot make an informed decision about what the role of this project would

critically important to my district bringing china into the wto has the potential of making the port of hueneme in my district an even more important portal for pacific rim trade with 20 percent of the worids population china is an appealing market it behooves us to work diligently and intelligently to open that market to unitedstates sellers the other hand carries many pitfalls chinas track record in meeting its obligations under international agreements is not good china is the only remaining communist superpower china has stolen our nuclear secrets and threatens stability in asia with her belligerence towards taiwan and others we ignore that reality at our own peril last year i voted against a oneyear extension of chinas most favored nation status based on two criteria the united states maintains a multibilliondollar trade deficit with china and has for years and china has repeatedly demonstrated an aggressive military stance that includes stealing our most important nuclear secrets at the beginning of this debate i was not automatically against chinas entry into the world trade organization but i did have some very serious concerns wto membership carries more protection for the united states than does most favored nation status mfn has been a oneway street it was a unilateral decision on our part to allow china access to our markets with no reciprocal opening on chinas behalf wto is more of a twoway street china must meet and maintain certain opendoor criteria to remain in the wto our trade with china historically has been a oneway street in 1990 our trade deficit with china stood at 10 4 billion by 1998 that deficit had climbed to 56 9 billion it is estimated our trade deficit with china in 1999 will be 66 4 billion chinas entry into wto and the ratification of the unitedstates china trade agreement can ease that deficit but only if the agreement has teeth i believe the wto process has those teeth in 1992 china and the unitedstates signed a bilateral memorandum of understanding on trade access china has violated it many times in 1992 we also struck a deal with china to protect intellectual property including copyrights on unitedstates products today unitedstates copyrights for motion pictures and software in china are still being stolen by chinese companies a situation that results in the loss of billions of dollars and many thousands of american jobs chinese noncompliance has forced us to threaten trade sanctions several times on the national security front china was continuing a systematic raid on the designs of our most sophisticated thermonuclear weapons at the same time that it was modernizing and pretending to normalize relations with the unitedstates among the stolen designs was information on the neutron bomb which to date no nation has opted to deploy and hopefully no one will even though china has been caught redhanded it continues to deny its espionage meanwhile it continues to showcase its belligerency by transferring sensitive missile technology to north korea and by repeatedly threatening to attack taiwan the unitedstates china agreement can have positive consequences for the unitedstates china and indeed the entire world the agreement will force china to open its markets to unitedstates goods and services which will result in a lowering of the trade deficit it could wean china from its passion for subsidies and govemment interference in its industries it could educate the chinese on the rule of law as opposed to its current system of rule by the whim of its leaders it could also hasten the spread of democracy within her borders each time a country has opened its economic markets an open market of ideas has followed but we must step carefully we must not let our desire to access chinas markets to blind us to chinas distaste for democracy her threat to our national security and her history of violating international laws and agreements for the wto agreement to

factors it must protect american jobs ensure chinese markets are open to american goods and services protect americas strategic interests andbe enforceable i have made it clear that without those provisions i would vote against permanent normal trade relations some of those protections were not in the bill until last night those protections are in the bill only because i and other members of

and for those who support greater human rights for the chinese people last night a bipartisan provision was incorporated into the bill that makes it easier for us to monitor chinas trade compliance

and antidumping countermeasures are more stringent for communist economies than it is for capitalist countries in addition the revised bill continues congress allimportant right to debate and vote on chinas human rights practices and international behavior each year the european union signed its wto agreement with china on friday followed by an agreement with australia on monday both were negotiated with chinas history of duplicity in mind in particular the eu agreement improves the deal signed by the unitedstates by making china significantly more open to foreign investment and trade under wto rules those provisions are open to the unitedstates as well we have given china permanent normal trade relations but this is not the end only the beginning china has at best a mixed record of living up to international agreements and i still have concerns about chinas adherence to this one but i am satisfied we have the mechanisms in place to force compliance or take remedial action if necessary american businesses will not have a level playing field unless we continually insist on it but now we have the tools to do that"], [0.9957601428031921, 0.9957601428031921, 0, "this debate that we undertake today is about better stronger fairer trade with china which in time will pave the way for social and political reforms some of these reforms are already evident today pennsylvania has exported more than 297 million in goods to china in 1998 voting for this agreement forces china to take down tariff barriers and nontariff barriers that have prevented even larger pennsylvania exports increasing the amount of exports to china will only help in creating jobs not only in pennsylvania but also throughout our country last november the unitedstates trade representative ambassador barshefsky completed historic negotiations with the peoples republic of china and managed to craft an agreement that would provide access to the chinese market while requiring no concessions by the unitedstates let us be clear about this this is no nafta we do not make a single jobkilling concession in this legislation the bill we consider today would allow the unitedstates to benefit from those negotiations the bill will not determine whether or not china enters the wto china is entering the world trade organization with or without this legislation i must admit that i entertained serious concerns when this issue was first raised i was concerned about human rights 4and fair trade which are critical to building a longterm stable relationship with china luckily through the bipartisan leadership of my friends and colleagues the gentleman from michigan and the gentleman from nebraska many of these issues have been addressed convincingly let us look at the facts the levinbereuter plan provides better oversight for human rights and protections than exist under current law it provides strong and enforceable antisurge protections which are part of the original agreement with the chinese government and will now be codified the levinbereuter provisions not only ensure that chinese play by the rules in trade but more importantly they strengthen unitedstates law to provide quick and effective weapons if there is a violation the bill includes language from levinbereuter urging that the wto approve both the prcs and taiwans accession in the same general council session all of these provisions are major improvements that make this overall package a good bill we are entering into a trade agreement with china that will create a more balanced relationship than any initiative to date this debate should be about ensuring that china plays by the rules in trade and that they honor commitments made in this agreement a china disengaged is more likely to be a rogue country in thenew century a china engaged is more likely to move down the sunlit path of human rights i challenge every one of my colleagues to vote to engage china a

seek leverage to force china to end human rights abuses house minority leader richard gephardt is against pntr as is the bulk if the democratic caucus so labor still threatens passage we find chinas recent behavior offensive we also realize the 20year most favored nation status charade did nothing to moderate beijings repeated rights abuses our support for pntr is based on simple reality china is not cuba it is the most populous nation in the world with the globes fastest growing economy it is senseless for the united states to treat the asian colossus as anything else than a superpower likely to emerge later this century with chinas markets open with american goodsand american popular cultureflowing throughout this giant nation dramatic reforms will eventually follow the old communist leadership will be just as powerless to stop these forces as its decreased former soviet and eastern block comrades and as fidel castro would be in cuba if american policy werent based on cold war

of the proposal to the wall street journal after voting with the ways and means committee to approve pntr and send it to the house floor last week english will vote for pntr because he understands the stakes china has agreed to join the world community and play by its trade rules with entry into the wto that is where americas influence is with china as a full trading partnernot some junior member

committee on international relations but for more than two decades as a real warriorin the cause of peace and justice in ireland we also have to commend the gentleman from new jersey chairman of the subcommittee on international operations and human rights for the invaluable work that he has done in holding hearings that go right to the depth of the allegations against the royal ulster constabulary and right to the heart of the problems which have inflicted law enforcement and the criminal justice system in northern ireland for far too many years for at least the last three decades also i have to commend the gentleman from massachusetts for the tremendous work he has done not just during the 12 years he has been in congress but the years before that when he was the mayor in springfield massachusetts and just for the tremendous amount of dedication and enthusiasm and unyielding tenacity he brings to this entire issue of peace and justice in ireland i know that if the gentleman from massachusetts were here tonight in fact he has asked me to say this on his behalf there is nobody in the house of representatives he looks up to more in providing moral leadership and guidance than the gentleman from massachusetts and the gentleman from massachusetts asked me to put that on the public record this evening as the gentleman from massachusetts said earlier this is a bipartisan issue i want to commend president clinton for the job that he has done i know that tonight the gentleman read into the record a statement from vice president gore the gentleman from new york chairman gilman and i and the gentleman from new jersey chairman smith can report last week governor bush also has put out a statement calling for the full implementation of the patten commission report which shows that this clearly is a bipartisan issue it is an issue on which all men and woman of goodwill can stand together what we are faced with tonight today and for the next weeks and months in the north of ireland is a true crisis if the good friday agreement is premised on concession and compromise the good friday agreement itself was a compromise the good friday agreement itself was based on very strong concessions made by all sides particularly by the catholic community the nationalist community the republican community who made very deep concessions in return for a pledge by the british and irish governments that all the provisions of the good friday agreement would be carried out no provision was more important in the patten commission than the section dealing with police reform because in the north of ireland for three decades the royal ulster constabulary was guilty of the most vicious and gross human rights violations imaginable it is hard for us as americans to envision in the english speaking world in the united kingdom which stands for the magna carta and justice and law that there was such brutality systematically carried out not the type of brutalities that occur by accident not those that are incidental but brutalities that were root and branch a part of the policing in northern ireland torture murder of children intentional killings intentionally maimings this was all part of the police policy in the north of ireland so the police have to be reformed that was an integral part the integral part of the good friday agreement and the patten commission which was chaired by chris patten a conservative mp a former conservative mp a minister in margaret thatchers government he came up with a series of reforms which again were themselves a compromise there is much that is lacking as the gentleman from new jersey chairman smith has pointed out time and again the patten commission itself the patten commission recommendations themselves are deficient yet now the british government is attempting to compromise the compromise it is attempting to water down the compromise of the patten commission to come out with a series of reforms that will not be reforms at all it will just be a readjustment of the status quo it will be a continuation of the royal ulster constabulary not even under a new name because the old name will still remain it will be a subset but it will still be there and this is wrong the entire peace process is at risk the entire peace process is being put at risk by the british government by the ulster unionist party and probably nothing is more aggravating than to hear someone like david trimble who is head of the ulster unionist party to say that we in the congress should not get involved that the american government should not get involved the reality is that on the night the good friday agreement was reached and the morning that it was signed david trimble would not sign it until he was assured by president clinton that the unitedstates would stay involved and now that we are involved he is saying that we should get out and back away from the agreement and allow it to go back to the status quo the way it was for three decades and seven decades and even three centuries if we want to go all the way back where the catholic community was systematically discriminated against and had their rights violated it is essential for us in the congress to stand together it is essential for the president to speak out as clearly as he has in the past to let the british government know to let tony blair know let the british secretary of state peter mandelson know that they cannot continue to violate the rights of catholics they cannot take the nationalist community for granted the fact is an agreement was signed an international agreement and the british government has the absolute obligation to enforce that agreement it cannot back down and cannot succumb to blackmail from david trimble because if it does it puts at risk the entire peace process and we will go back to the situation that ruined so many innocent lives for so many years if that happens the blood will be on the

china there are good people on both sides of this issue and as we consider granting china mfn we need to be honest in our debate yesterday the new york times had an article written by joseph kahn with the headline executives make trade with china a moral issue this article describes how some members of the business community in florida approached one of our colleagues saying that passing mfn was a moral issue that extending normal trade status to china is a moral necessity this could be a dangerous line of reasoning for those who favor granting china mfn particularly given chinas human rights record in light of what so many chinese citizens face at the hands of the chinese government the term moral is of concern there are now at least eight roman catholic bishops being held in prison here is a picture of one of those bishop jia he had been arrested on august 15 1999 been arrested to prevent him from conducting mass on an important roman catholic feast he is 66 years old has been in jail in a chinese labor camp for 20 years i will tell the gentleman from florida this is a moral issue just a few days ago the chinese government arrested another roman catholic bishop surrounding him late in the night by 150 policemen scores of roman catholic laymen were arrested this is a moral issue countless protestant house church leaders have been arrested and imprisoned simply for practicing their faith here is a photo of pastor li showing the police grabbing him and taking him off to jail he has been in and out of prison since 1983 this is a moral issue i have been to china i have been to tiananmen square and seen where the tanks have rolled over the people and flattened them in the wake i have been to beijing prison number one where tiananmen square demonstrators were working on socks to export to united states this i would tell the gentleman from florida is a moral issue i visited tibet several years ago in tibet the chinese have raped and pillaged that peaceful country committing untold atrocities upon the tibetan population scores of buddhist monks and nuns are in prison because of their faith this is a moral issue there are more prison labor camps in china now than there were when solzhenitzen wrote the book gulag archipelago this is a moral issue the muslims in china are being persecuted daily and no one speaks out this is a moral issue as a member of congress i am able to attend various national security briefings that i cannot go into here on the house but i can say that the chinese military presents fundamental dangers to the west and to our men and women in the armed services we need to tread very carefully in our actions which give aid to the chinese military and the government and who knows what the future may hold where the battle lines could be drawn this is a moral issue the peoples liberation army are dumping assault weapons into the united states that are killing women and children this is a moral issue so i would say that the clinton administration and others in support of mfn should be careful in crafting their arguments in support of mfn by using moral language this administration has done little or nothing to speak up with regard to chinas human rights going so far as to actually meet with the chinese officials in tiananmen square this administration has done nothing in many of these areas so in closing there are good people on both sides of the issue in this congress who care deeply about this the congress is split however i would say we need to focus on the real moral issues the persecution of the roman catholics the persecution of the protestants the persecution of the buddhists in tibet the persecution of the muslims the prison labor camps and the threat to our national security these are moral issues i would say to those gentlemen have they written the state department to ask that the pastor be released have they written the state department to say please let the bishop out he has been in jail for 20 years my sense is they have not and this i would tell my colleagues on both sides of the issue this is the moral issue that this congress will have to face every segment of the united
