back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a bipartisan way and it will not be like it is now and it will not be business as usual and it will not be well i dont care if you do not like it"], [0.000444948673248291, 0.9995550513267517, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time as a member of the joint economic committee i rise today to speak on the economic policies of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.0004582405090332031, 0.9995417594909668, 1, "i would like to thank my colleague and dear friend the gentleman from california mr honda who is managing this special order but more especially also as an outstanding leader in our asian pacific american community and currently serving as chairman of our asian pacific congressional caucus i want to also commend our democratic leader ms nancy pelosi for her outstanding remarks the fact that she also is a member who has one of the largest constituencies in not only the state of california of our asian pacific american community but as ms pelosi was making her statement i recalled also her predecessor someone whom i have had the highest admiration and respect for a giant of a man not only in his ways but as an example with a real great sensitivity and compassion for the needs of the asian pacific american community people none other than the late congressman phil burton i would also like to commend my colleagues congresswoman juanita millendermcdonald and congressman al green for their outstanding remarks this evening in this special order i rise today in celebration of the asian pacific american heritage month to acknowledge the contributions of our asian pacific american individuals and communities to the success of our great nation i commend my colleagues who founded this celebration in 1977 by introducing a resolution calling upon the president to proclaim the first 10 days in may asian pacific heritage week former representatives norm mineta and frank horton and senators daniel k inouye and senator spark matsunaga i think we need to also understand the dynamics those of us who are americans and we are very very proud of being americans but whose roots are from the asian pacific region and the dynamics of why the asian pacific region is so important it is in our national interests not only our national security the economics just about every phase of what is really critically important in our nation in dealing with this region of the world which by the way twothirds of the worlds population is the asian pacific region six of the 10 largest armies in the world are in the asian pacific region our trade with the asian pacific region is four times greater than any other region in the world including especially that of europe i am reminded a couple of years ago what senator inouye said for every one 747 that flies between the atlantic and the united states four 747s fly between the asian pacific region and our country the asian pacific american community is vibrant and growing with an estimated 14 million asian american residents and another 975 000 pacific americans i am proud to be a member of this asian pacific american community a community that has produced so many inspiring individuals in government in the military in the sciences sports entertainment business you name it we have it in government for example especially from the great state of hawaii among the first i guess you might say unitedstates senator hiram fong senator daniel inouye senator daniel akaka the first elected asian american governor of any state governor george ariyoshi our first native hawaiian governor governor john waihee our first filipino american governor governor ben cayetano we also have mayor neal blaisdell and the newly elected mayor of the city and county of honolulu mufi hannemann we also have lieutenant governors jimmy kealoha and duke ainoa norm mineta a good friend of mine who is not only partly responsible for initiating this heritage month but was always the first asian pacific american mayor of a major unitedstates city like san jose he was also the first asian pacific american to be a member of a presidential cabinet when he was appointed as secretary of commerce in the year 2000 by former president clinton and now is unitedstates secretary of transportation appointed by president bush elaine chao another first secretary chao is the first female asian american cabinet member appointed secretary of labor by president bush gary locke first asian american governor on the mainland united states elected governor of the state of washington in 1996 and i could never forget and my deepest respect to the late congresswoman patsy mink first asian american female elected to the unitedstates congress since 1964 then our late colleague and friend my dear friend the late congressman bob matsui who inspired me and mentored me throughout our time here together as a senior member of the house committee on ways and means as a vietnam veteran it would be ludicrous for me not to say something to honor the hundreds of thousands of asian pacific americans who have and continue to serve in all the branches of the armed services of our nation i would like to share with you the contributions of tens of thousands of japanese american soldiers who volunteered to fight our nations enemies in europe during world war ii we are all aware of the fact that after the surprise attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 by the imperial army of japan there was such an outrage and cry for an allout war against japan in days afterwards our president and the congress formally declared war but caught in this crossfire were hundreds of thousands of americans mind you americans who happened to be of japanese ancestry our national government immediately implemented a policy whereby over 100 000 americans of japanese ancestry were forced to live in what were called supposedly relocation camps i call them concentration camps their lands their homes and their properties were confiscated without dueprocess of law it was also a time in our nations history that there was so much hatred and bigotry and racism against our japanese american community and yet despite all of this leaving their wives their parents their brothers and sisters behind barbedwire fences in these prison camps the white house accepted the requests from tens of thousands of japanese americans who volunteered to join the army and as a result two combat units were organized one was called the 100th battalion and the other was known as the 442nd infantry combat group both were sent to europe to fight and i might say that i am very very proud to have been associated and been a former member of the 100th battalion 442nd infantry combat group out of the state of hawaii in my humble opinion history speaks for itself in documenting that none have shed their blood more valiantly for our nation than the japanese american solders who served in those two combat units while fighting enemy forces in europe during world war h the military records of the 100th battalion and the 442nd infantry are without equal those japanese american units suffered an unprecedented casualty rate of 314 percent and received over 18 000 individual decorations many awarded posthumously for bravery and courage in the field of battle for your information 52 distinguished service crosses 560 silver stars and 9 480 purple hearts were awarded to the japanese american soldiers of the 100th battalion and 442nd infantry group i find it unusual however that only one medal of honor was given nonetheless the 442nd combat group emerged as the most decorated combat unit of its size in the history of the united states army president truman was so moved by their bravery in the field of battle as well as the tremendous sacrifices of the african american soldiers in world war ii that he issued an executive order to finally desegregate all of the branches of the armed services senator inouye lost his arm while engaged in battle against two german machine gun posts and he was awarded the distinguished service cross after a congressional mandate to review again the military records of these two combat units some 5 years ago i was privileged to attend a white house ceremony where president clinton presented 19 19 congressional medals of honor to the japanese american soldiers who were members of the 100th battalion and 442nd combat infantry senator inouye was one of those recipients of the congressional medal of honor i submit these japanese americans paid their dues in blood to protect our nation from its enemies it is a shameful mark on the history of our country that when the patriotic survivors of the 100th battalion and the 442nd infantry returned to the united states to be reunited with their families who were locked up behind barbed wire fences living in prison camps and could not even get a haircut in downtown san francisco simply because they looked japanese they were japanese and for that reason alone even with their uniforms on they were not given the privilege of getting a haircut my former colleague and now unitedstates secretary of transportation norm mineta and the fate congressman bob matsui from sacramento both spent some of the early years of their lives in these prison camps secretary mineta told me one of the interesting features of these prison camps was posting of machine gun nests all around the camp and everyone was told that these machine guns were posted to protect them against rioters but then secretary mineta observed if these machine guns were posted to guard us why is it that they are all directed inside the prison camp rather than outside it i submit ladies and gentlemen my good friends my colleagues the wholesale and arbitrary abolishment of the constitutional rights of these loyal japanese americans should forever serve as a reminder and testament that this must never be allowed to occur again when this miscarriage of justice unfolded during world war ii americans of german and italian ancestry were not similarly jailed en masse some declared the incident as an outright example of racism and bigotry in its ugliest form after viewing the holocaust museum in washington i understand better why the genocide of some 6 million jews has prompted the cry never again neveragain likewise i sincerely hope that mass internments on the basis of race alone will never again darken the pages of the history of this great nation now to those who say well that happened decades ago we must say that we have to continue to be on our guard for this kind of thing to happen again i remember years ago the case of bruce yamashita the japanese american born and raised in the state of hawaii who was discharged from the marine corps after a training program as an officer candidate and an ugly display of racial discrimination the marine corps superiors taunted yamashita with ethnic slurs and told him we do not want your kind around here go back to your own country the situation was made worse when a leading officer of the marine corps made a statement on the 60 minutes program who said marine officers who are minorities do not shoot swim or use compasses as well as white officers the commandant later apologized for his remarks but it was a little too late and i am really happy to know that after all of the investigations that the secretary of the navy finally awarded mr yamashita his commission as an officer and a captain in the united states marine corps the tradition continues today of the thousands of asian pacific americans who served in the armed services retired general eric shinseki was the first asian pacific american fourstar general who served as unitedstates army chief of staff our asian american pacific island soldiers are fighting for freedom in iraq even as i speak just this past weekend i was privileged to witness in germany the swearing in of a samoan soldier by the name of command sergeant major iuniasolua savusa as the command sergeant major for unitedstates army europe and the 7th army i am very proud of command sergeant major savusa for his accomplishments he is an inspiration and a great role model for our youth and other asian pacific americans who currently serve in the military i think at this point i want to defer to my good friend the gentleman from california the manager of this special order this evening and i am sure that he may want to continue portions of his statement as well"], [0.0004622936248779297, 0.9995377063751221, 1, "it is an honor to come before the house we would like to thank not only democratic leader ms pelosi but the entire democratic leadership mr hoyer mr menendez and mr clyburn our vice chair of the democratic caucus as you know the 30something working group comes to the floor to share not only with members but also with the american people about what is happening good here in the capitol and also what is happening bad here in the capitol and hopefully through a bipartisan effort we can move towards positive change here in the capitol it saddens me to report the fact that this congress need it be whatever poll you look at the american people by 33 percent think that we are doing a good job thirtythree percent of the american people feel that this congress is doing a good job i would tell you that if it was a grade system i would assume that and members i would assume that that would be a failing grade i have two children that attend school and if their grades were based on a 33 percent performance i do not think that they would be moving to the next grade and i think it is important members of congress as we start to look at our responsibilities to the american people not just to our constituents in our districts but to the american people because by them sending us to congress they federalized us to come up here and run this country in the way that it should be i also want to remind the members that this is the peoples house it is not my house it is not mr ryans house it is not ms wasserman schultzs house all due respect it is not your house it is the peoples house in the senate i must add and we must let all of the members we must remind them in the senate someone can be appointed to the senate of course they have elections but in a time let us just say like in new jersey the governor of new jersey the new governor of new jersey has the opportunity who was a unitedstates senator to appoint someone to be the new unitedstates senator from the state of new jersey but in the house with a seat being vacated let us just say someone from new jersey is appointed to be the senator he cannot appoint someone here to the house of representatives he would have to set a special election for that seat to be filled constitutionally so this is the peoples house and so when we start talking about the people of the united states of america we are closer to them than any other i think than any other branch of government i would like to say that on the heels of president bushs speech today on iraqs economy i could not help and mr ryan and i just returned from iraq we visited three cities in iraq and we went to the infamous green zone and baghdad visiting our troops many of them were members of the army soldiers some on their third deployment to iraq i could not help but pay attention and i got a copy of the presidents h11199 speech and he released a 35page 32 pages if you look at glossy cover and all 35 pages of his strategy for victory there in iraq but he talked about the economy today in iraq but i cannot help but say and to the members that it would have been good if the president could have talked about our unitedstates economy i think the reason why he did not talk about the unitedstates economy is the fact that we have record deficits some 3 5 trillion over the next 10 years deficits that is not the kendrick meek report that is not the tim ryan report that is not the congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz report that is reality we are recordbreaking as it relates to borrowing money members from foreign countries this president along with this republican majority here in the house and in the senate has achieved 4 5 trillion in borrowing money from foreign nations more than 42 presidents before him they were only able to among all of those presidents i mean all of them i am talking about since we became a country 4 1 trillion that have been achieved and i want to correct myself i am sorry i have so many numbers here i want to correct myself i am glad mr ryan brought this over 1 05 trillion by this president i said four and i will correct myself right now because in the 30something working group we believe in thirdparty validators and sharing with the american people and the members the truth about what is happening here in the capitol so maybe 4 05 might have sounded a little better but we believe in making sure that we give good information 1 05 trillion this president the last 4 years 2001 to 2005 and he is not done yet 1 01 trillion 42 presidents in the history of this country republican democrat and in their lifetime for some of them very early on were members of the whig party from 1776 to 2000 224 years and this is from the unitedstates department of treasury this is not from the national democratic party or anything like that we just want to make sure mr ryan that we have our thirdparty validators here maybe the president mr ryan could have talked abouit the fact that health care costs increased over 60 percent for small businesses over the last 5 years major companies are cutting jobs and not only their pension plan that they promised but they are following our lead here under this republican majority mr ryan by the fact that we are not only increasing copayments and the wait for our veterans once they leave the military they are following our lead companies like gm delphi merck verizon and now ford are now reprioritizing that means cutting jobs that means cutting back on promises that they promised their employees from the beginning the average family right now in the united states as relates to natural gas are paying three times more than they paid in 2001 the president could have talked about that but he did not he wanted to talk about iraq because he needs to explain himself republican majority they need to explain themselves sixty percent of americans if we like it or not do not believe that our leadership as relates to leading our effort in iraq has a sound plan in getting us out of there so we are going to talk about some of these things tonight we are going to also talk about this ongoing culture of corruption andc cronyism and incompetence this is not the kendrick meek report this is just todays papers this is just today that is outlining a culture of corruption and cronyism and incompetence so when historians look back on the 109th congress and the contributions that we made they are also going to look at the void in leadership and leading this country in the way that they should lead we used to give speeches here on the floor mr ryan and you know full well about putting burden on future generations fl 2015 well i can tell the members right now and this is not me speaking they can check with any of the federal agencies that do the reports or the auditor generals that put out reports on an annual basis we are putting this generation in the present in jeopardy so i am so glad that we have the opportunity tonight to come to the floor and i am so glad that the gentleman from ohio is here and i am glad that we have a level of consistency for the american people to come to the floor and share this information i yield to the gentleman from ohio"],

this budget proposal will have on the lives of working american families this year thanks to president bushs taxcutting progtam the unitedstates government will deliver up to 106 billion to the multiple bank accounts of some of the wealthiest americans this government program to help wealthy americans spend more money now forces a false crunch on our resources a 50 billion cut that republicans believe should come from medicaid food stamps and student loans who will feel the impact of these cuts well almost 60percent of all people in nursing homes who are on medicaid and onethird of all babies who are born on medicaid and 8 million americans with disabilities who depend on medicaid and 36 million americans who have to worry about going hungry how do we as a congress reconcile the fact that these cuts will disproportionately affect lowincome americans the elderly and the poor the answer is we should not reconcile ourselves to such an action not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the proposedcuts are robbing the poor of opportunity the reconciliation budget targets programs that work to bridge the gap between rich and poor medicaid food stamps and student loans that strive to even the playing field for all american families eight weeks ago across the united states americans saw the faces of other americans staring up at them from television screens scratching out desperate signs on rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we as a congress will rise up to defeat it

living on half of poverty a single mother with her child living at half of poverty is trying to survive on 535 a month that is two people living on 123 37 a week and each day in america 2 385 more babies are born into poverty the republicans will say that society has little obligation to help the poor because they fail to take personal responsibility for their lives the united states has highest gdp in the world we are first in military technology first in military exports first in gross domestic product first in the number of millionaires and billionaires and first in health technology but we rank 12th in living standards among our poorest onefifth 13th in the gap between rich and poor 14th in efforts to lift children out of poverty 18th in the percent of children in poverty and 37th in the health status of our citizens we should be working to close these gaps and ensure that all americans have a fair chance at life and are treated with basic human dignity instead this reconciliation plan will take away food health care education and the abilityto live in dignity in old age from people who have no other options this budget will proliferate existing inequalities i simply cannot reconcile this budget with my values because this budget does not reflect who we are as a nation and what we believe our responsibility is to other americans we will be judged by how

vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that

war and hurricane katrina it is a story with no best of times only the worst of times this tale is why i oppose the supplemental appropriations act the main characters in my story are an incompetent president and a corrupt congress the setting is an america desperate for honest leadership but the plot involves lies and coverups the problem is misplaced priorities but the solution is not this supplemental which provides another 67 6 billion for a failed war but only 19 billion to help the victims of katrina the first disaster the iraq war was predicated on lies iraq had no weapons of mass destruction had never attempted to buy uranium from niger and was not about to welcome american soldiers with open arms an incompetent president failed to prepare america for the postwar period as a result looting of stores and museums began shortly after the united states military gained control of baghdad months later sectarian violence has pushed iraq to civil war with shiite militia and security forces clashing with sunni citizens and insurgents yet our troops remain in iraq and in harms way two american soldiers and 40 iraqi soldiers and civilians are killed every day as long as we stay in iraq the insurgency will continue even as the socalled iraqi democracy experiment goes nowhere three months after parliamentary elections the iraqi parliament has yet to form a government finally large republican donors including halliburton have looted the american treasury using their connections to secure nobid contracts for services in iraq these firms overcharge american taxpayers and underserve our troops all the while republicans blind allegiance to the president causes them to write blank checks throwing good money after bad at a war that is making america less secure the second disaster was the republican response to hurricane katrina several days before katrina ravaged the gulf coast the president was briefed on the severity of the storm and the likelihood levees would be breached but after failing to cut short his extended vacation to help with the response the president told abc news and the american public he was not advised the levees were likely to collapse after years of underfunding levee construction and mairtenance republicans attempted to shift the blame for the disaster and the inadequate response onto state and local officials but it was president bush who nominated unqualified campaign hacks to head fema and congressional republicans who rubberstamped the appointment of michael brown as a result of insufficient preparation and incompetent administration tens of thousands of hurricane victims went without adequate food water and shelter in the storms aftermath six months after katrina relief workers are still finding bodies of victims in an attempt to atone for their sins the republicans have finally brought forth additional legislation to help katrina victims but in a pathetic and transparent attempt to prevent full debate on the disastrous iraq war president bushs republican cronies in congress combined two supplementals into one although i support additional funding for hurricane victims i cannot vote for a supplemental that appropriates 74 percent of its funds or 67 6 billion to a misguided iraq war on which we have already wasted 350 billionand the lives of 2 310 american soldiers and at least 37 000 iraqi citizens it is time to tell a new tale about bringing home our troops and rebuilding homes for katrina victims lets get this iraq monkey off our back and supplement housing rather than halliburton i urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and help me to tell a new tale about american successes rather than republicans disasters"], [0.0005289912223815918, 0.9994710087776184, 1,

is fine we will give you what you want of course i think we are going to see more of that kind of action by the republican majority to say that oh we are with you even if we are running the country into the ground we know better we know that we have foreign countries that we are borrowing from because we cant even borrow from ourselves anymore because we have done such a bad job we know we have raised the debt ceiling time after time after time again meanwhile we come to the floor and say our policies are working we know that there are things we should not be doing because you are working every day or you are running your business eyery day you may not be paying attention to everything that is going on not only are we elected but we are paid to watch out for your best interest and also for future generations best interests and they are doing it and i think that the paradigm shift as it relates to the american people paying attention to what they are doing in a way from a fiscal way i think will take place between now and november and so what is so unfortunate abqut this whole situation is that we are supposed to be responsible policymakers on a bipartisan basis and that is not happening right now that is just not happening the american taxpayers are getting mugged knocked down and kicked by this republican majority and the rubber stamp or the rubberstamp congress republican majority that is here now one other thing i want to mention here which i think is very very important just today mr ryan mrs tubbs jones we dont have to go back to weeks or months or 2 years ago or 3 years ago we had a payasyougo provision here individuals decided not to take it up we had an opportunity to raise the minimum wage on behalf of the american taxpayers the republican majority rejected an opportunity to raise the minimum wage for everyday working americans as a matter of fact mr ryan one of the republican leaders said i havent voted in 25 years to raise the minimum wage and if he would have had his way the minimum wage would still be 3 35 versus 5 15 i am so glad that my state joined 21 other states in raising the minimum wage meanwhile we are still here with chisel and hammer in hand as neanderthals on the republican side of the ball and saying oh we dont have to raise the minimum wage we are so indebted to the special interests that we dont even want to bother them of having an american public that is able to pay the rent or pay for their house mortgage or to be able to put gas in their tank we are so invested in the k street project we are so invested in so many other things that we are willing to allow these individuals to suffer but guess what those are the same individuals that are making america america and there are millions of americans that are there and so what is very very unfortunate here is the fact that the republican majority is still boasting about you know we are in charge we are going to continue to keep our foot on the necks of everyday americans that are going in punching in and punching out every day 5 days a week sometimes 6 because they have to work overtime those americans that know what it means to take a 15minute break in the morning and a 15minute break in the afternoon and a solid 30 minutes of lunch if they get that and they better not be a minute late those kind of individuals i think are going to go to the polls this november and say no more they are going to go to the polls and say we are willing to fight for the kind of accountability that we need from this government i am so proud of the 30something working group and the members that come down here and the democratic members that file legislation on behalf of the american people not on behalf of the democratic party not even on behalf of the democratic caucus not on behalf of our leadership but on behalf of the individuals that they represent who woke up early one tuesday morning and voted for representation in this unitedstates house of representatives and i must add the only chamber that you have to be elected to that you cant be appointed to al due respect to the senate but senators can be appointed by governors if a senator was to say hey you know i have had enough i want to go home i want to take care of my grandkids a governor can appoint a senator but in democracy in this chamber in the unitedstates house if one member were to say hey i want to take care of my grandkids i want to spend more time with my kids they have to run for office they have to run for office and they have to be replaced by the people so we have a greater responsibility we have a greater responsibility than the white house than the senate or the supreme court when you look at the three branches government to the american people the oversight house resolution 841 and mr cardozas legislation that calls for the calling in those administrators that are not accountable to taxpayers dollars these are the kind of bills that we must pass one thing i can say mr ryan which is so very important on our side of the ball of saying we want to take this country in a new direction is the fact that we said we will increase the minimum wage we will make our country more energyindependent within 10 years we will implement the 9 11 recommendations to be able to make sure that we can fight terrorism here and make sure that local communities have

done it is appropriate that the 30 omething group is advocating advancing in a new direction because this new direction is absolutely essential for young people in our country our 30somethings are committed to a better future for all americans so is our new direction a newdirection for all americans not just the privileged few we can begin with our six for 06 to make america safer we will begin by passing the 9 11 commission recommendations we have just observed the fifth anniversary of 9 11 here we are 5 years after 9 11 the commission is giving the federal government ds and fs and incompletes for implementation of their recommendations the first day of congress we will pass the 9 11 commission recommendations and make america safer we will make our economy fairer and we will begin by passing the minimum wage we can do it next week the bill is in the hopper to make our economy fair we can pass the minimum wage and certainly not have congress have any increase in its salary until there is an increase and unless there is an increase in the minimum wage we can also remove the incentives for companies to send jobs overseas imagine taxpayers are giving incentives for companies to send job overseas we will end that we will make colleges more affordable it is important to broaden the opportunity for a college education and we will begin by making college tuition tax deductible and cutting in half the interest on student loans we will make health care more affordable and we will begin by allowing the government to negotiate for lower prices for prescription drugs and we will promote stem cell research that is better for a healthy america we will move towards energy independence that our colleagues were talking about here we will begin by repealing the subsidies that have been given to big oil and big energy compa nies and instead use that 18 billion for research in alternative energy resources every day that we are here we will work for a dignified retirement by preserving social security protecting pensions and encouraging savings for americas seniors this we will do within the first 100 hours of a new congress given the opportunity but we could do it now even before congress leaves instead we have a donothing rubberstamp congress i see the rubber stamp here here we are just a few days from the end of the fiscal year and this congress has still not passed the budget for this fiscal year how could it be a week before the end of the fiscal year and this donothing congress has not even passed the budget in addition we have a crying need in our country for comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform we certainly are not moving in any direction to make that possible the list goes on we havent finished our appropriations bills we shouldnt leave here until we have an increase in the minimum wage but when we return and hopefully with a verdict from the american people we will get about the peoples business the issues that are relevant to the lives of the american people their jobs their health care their economic security the health care for their families the education of their children safe america safe neighborhoods and a secure america with energy independence we will do all of this from the very first day with integrity our first rule that members will vote on will be for integrity to sever the link between special interests and legislation so that we are here for the peoples interest instead with civility with bipartisan administration of the house so that every voice in the country is heard not only the voices

sunday may 1 through sunday may 8 i rise today in support of the goals of cover the uninsured week cover the uninsured week will mobilize thousands of business owners union members educators students patients hospital staff physicians nurses faith leaders and many others to call attention to the health care crisis in our country in hundreds of our communities across the country events will highlight the fact that too many americans are living without health care coverage today 45 million americans live without health care coverage including 8 million children as a californian i am troubled to learn that california leads the nation in the nufiber of uninsured people with 6 5 million people who do not have any form of health care insurance that is about 18 percent of our population and additionally one out of every 5 of our uninsured population in california is a child under the age of 18 years uninsured numbers are even worse for the latino community which is disproportionately affected by the lack of health care coverage as a latina i am saddened to see that latinos have the highest uninsured rate of any racial group and here in this figure i would like to point out that back in the year 2003 as my colleagues can see hispanics represent 34 3 percent of those individuals that are uninsured when we look at the different racial and ethnic groups latinos are the highest numbers that are uninsured the latest census figures indicate that 13 million latinos are uninsured that is more than onethird of our total latino population in the country this is despite the fact that latinos constitute the second largest ethnic minority group in the country and have the largest labor force representation latinos hold the majority of lowwage jobs in the unitedstates these positions mostly do not offer health care bene fits i want to make a special note of the fact that nearly 80 percent of those without health insurance are employed listen they are employed but they have no health care coverage so we have to stop the myth that the uninsured problem is only about people that are unemployed in fact this is a picture here depicting a family in our district that shows people who are working they are working but unavailable to them is health care insurance and in a country that prides itself on equality it is evident that our health care system is broken when people suffer from a lack of access to health insurance and quality of care more disconcerting latino children the most vulnerable group in our society are 21 percent more likely to be uninsured than nonlatino children in fact almost one in three latino children receives health care through medicaid or what we know as the state childrens health insurance program the schip program while plenty of americans live without health insurance programs like medicaid and the schip program are often the only means of providing families like this with health care coverage medicaid is vital for many latinos with 9 million latinos receiving health care through medicaid alone unfortunately it is sad to say that president bushs fiscal year 2006 budget proposal would cut funding for medicaid by 45 billion a drastic cut in funding that is a valuable service for health insurance for those who cannot afford it we should not play with the lives of families like this and the future of our children by denying them access to critical health care services affordable and accessible health care not only decreases the expenses due to last minute emergency care it allows for a healthier workforce and improves the overall quality of care for all last week i had the opportunity as chair of the congressional hispanic task force on health and i was joined by other members of our democratic leadership to highlight our commitment to eliminate racialand ethnic disparities in health care our health care system is not meeting the needs of all people for racial and ethnic minorities and even for asian pacific islanders for all of our communities we are sorely underserved by the services that should be adequately provided to all of us democrats are committed to working towards expanding health care insurance coverage for all and i am committed to addressing the health care needs of all of our communities the uninsured problem affects every single one of us whether it is expanding our federal safety net programs like medicaid or working to eliminate racial and ethnichealth care disparities or providingincentives for our small businesses to offer health care insurance it is time that we take action now i urge my colleagues to make a federal commitment to help provide coverage for the 45 million americans across the country who deserve a guaranteed health

natural gas and professes that natural gas is a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk

housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these

amendment is one of the foundations of our constitutional liberties in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gunstorage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired further the severe penalties for non compliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states second a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess armor piercing bullets just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397 i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering h r 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments notably gun owners of america has written to house members to request that they oppose s 397 and instead support h r 800 last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397 while i am concemed about some of the federalism implications of h r 800 it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices with 258 sponsors and cosponsors h r 800 would easily pass the house the house voting for h r 800 would allow the differences between h r 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee in conference every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original unamended s 397 had 62 senate sponsors and cosponsorsa filibuster proof majority

addressing the losses incurred throughout this country due to floods it assures that businesses and families have access to affordable flood insurance that would not be availableon the open market prior to the passage of the national flood insurance act in 1968 insurance companies generally did not offer coverage for flood disaster because of the high risk involved today more than 20 000 communities participate in the national flood insurance program more than 90 insurance companies sell and service flood service insurance there are more than four million policies covering the total of 800 billion the national flood insurance program provides federal flood insurance for properties located in floodprone areas where the community has voluntarily agreed to institute floodplain management and land use control measures that minimize the risk of flooding and mitigate potential flood damage the program is intended to provide a more costefficient alternative to costly federal disaster assistance by encouraging communities to take preventive measures to reduce flood losses and providing affordable flood insurance that would not otherwise be commercially available last years hurricane season resulted in significant strains on the nfip the claims resulting from the losses from these catastrophic hurricanes is unprecedented in the history of the program since the nfips inception in 1968 the program paid out 15 billion in claims in contrast claims for hurricanes katrina and rita alone are expected to exceed 25 billion this far surpasses claims paid by the entire history of the nfip in the past when losses exceeded premiums the nfip had been allowed to borrow from the unitedstates treasury to repay claims such loans have traditionally been paid back rather quickly with interest the bill before us today increases the amount that fema may borrow from the unitedstates treasury to 25 billion to cover the expenses incurred by the national flood insurance program nfip during the last years hurricane season as cbo has stated the funds borrowed from treasury so far exceed the programs income from premiums and fees they will likely never be repaid as such this bill proposes a number of reforms to the program to ensure that it is actuarially sound in the future when we debated this in committee some individuals made proposals and for the best of reasons they said we should look at a 100year traditional floodplain and anybody within a 100year traditional floodplain should be required to pay for insurance the problem that unany of us have who represent districts who have mitigated 100year floodplains is that all of our people who are not at risk would be required to basically boost the program by increased premiums by them participating in it also and when federal dollars state and local have been spent to mitigate 100year floodplains many of us thought that that was unreasonable in fact the 100year floodplain would have impacted a large portion of l a county that i represent anything near the l a river would have been included and most of orange county would also because the prado dam mitigates that there was another proposal made with the best of heart and the best of concern for the people of this country that said lets look at a historical 500year floodplain the problem we had with that is there is no evidence available and then there is no information available either that we can dictate and determine how much a 500year floodplain might be if we had taken a 500year historical floodplain it would have included all of l a

join chairman barton and chairman boehlert in introducing h r compromise consensus legislation to fully implement the legal obligations of the united states of america under the stockholm or pops convention the rotterdam or pic convention and the aarhus pops protocol to the geneva lrtap convention this is solid public policy that i urge my colleagues to support because it reasonably implements the pops and pic conventions and the lrtap protocol w v pso 4 years and evcn as recently as a few months ago i have heard people ask ssional record extensions many questions about this bill why is it necessary for this legislation to become law if the united states is already attending these meetings isnt that enoughwhy do we need to move on this bill what does being a full partner mean to these agreements and what does it give the united states government and its people in terms of rights and opportunities that we do not already have these are all good questions but persistent repetition of these inquiries shows a fatal misunderstanding of these agreements and exactly why it is in the interest of the united states to become a party with full rights under these accords at a minimum the failure of congress to pass implementing legislationthus securing senate ratification of these treatiesleaves the united states government in the position of defending its interests and sharing its expertise only when other countries welcome it not when we wish and need for our own national purposes to offer it the unitedstates environmental protection agency has testified before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on environment and hazardous materials that it has been forced to wait long periods of time to be recognized because the leaders of the treatyrelated meetings did not consider our delegation important enough to be recognized sooner this situation presents a radical departure from the leadership role our country took in building the consensus for these pacts to exist our delegations should not be welcomed at the receptions for these international meetings but barred from being integral players in the technological discussions and final decisionmaking processes in these treaties failure to support this legislation is a clear signal that congress misunderstands the sophistication of our nations chemical knowledge base and regulatory experience and instead wishes the united states to cede its traditional leadership role in international toxic chemicals management in 2001 the bush administration pledged the commitment of the united states of america to join the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants that date marked the culmination of 10 years of bipartisan cooperation and leadership concerning global protection of the environment and public health these efforts included not just pops but the aarhus protocol on long range transboundary air pollution lrtap of pops and the rotterdam convention on prior informed consent pic these were not the triumphs of republican or democrat white houses they were the victories premised on the various needs and hopes of all americans sadly the benefits of these agreements have not been actualized because of the policy and political agendas of the interested stakeholders as they relate to chemical management it is unacceptable that those private parties that are subsets of the interests in our country whether they are businesses or nonprofits have as much if not more input than our own government officials at these meetings we must put these matters behind us and focus solely on making the unitedstates a full partner before i go into the specifics of this legislation and address some of its broader themes i want to briefly further explain why this legislation is being introduced and why it is different from my bill h r 4591 which also wold totally implement and make the united states a full partner in these agreements of remarks december 8 2006 first this bill is being introduced as a consensus position of the majority of stakeholders who have testified before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on environment and hazardous materials that they want the united states to pass implementing legislation second this legislation is different from h r 4591 as introduced because it represents a goodfaith compromise among members of congress who actively sought to sit down with me and work out mutually acceptable provisions i have always been willing to work with any member of congress on compromise provisions despite the fact that some members delay in getting back to me on whether they wanted to work out a compromise made enactment of this legislation nearly impossible finally this legislation is a collaborative work of elected officials with input from others some people think that this kind of legislation needs to be delegated to interest groups to forge not only am i dubious about punting our constitutional responsibility to legislate to unelected persons but history has shown that the same people who have called for a consensus stakeholder process have twice killed the resulting bills regarding the specifics of this bill first this bill is a targeted legislative fix that fills the existing legal gaps and only does what is important for us to become a full partner in these agreements it does not repeal any part of federal environmental law but rather adds a new section to the toxic substances control act to ban the manufacture processing distribution in commerce use and disposal of agreed upon pops and lrtap pops chemical substances and mixtures this new section also grants separate new authority for the united states to enact new regulations for future additions of pops chemical substances or mixtures to the stockholm convention or lrtap pops protocol because there has been concern from a number of persons about the difficulty existing tsca provisions present in the way of regulating existing chemicals this bill creates a distinct and different process within tsca that couples similary rigorous and sound scientific analyses but with a more deferential regulatory standard and the elimination of procedural hurdles that many argue have hindered epa from taking action regarding chemical protection this is not the tsca overhaul that many critics of the chemical manufacturing world have wanted but it is a solid middle ground that relies on science rather than emotion to address these very insidious chemicals while also keeping these treaties out of governing american manufacturing processes and decisions in addition while many political opponents of past pops legislative efforts have argued that the language in this legislation makes regulation of pops more difficult and places profits of chemical companies over the protection of human health a reading of the plain language of this legislation would prove how wrong and intentionally inflammatory they are to insist on this interpretation specifically this legislation sets its regulatory standard at protecting human health and the environment and intends that while exercising this legal authority the epa administrator in choosing the means to provide that protection is to balance costs and benefits in other words costs and benefits are to be taken into consideration in determining how to regulate a substance not whether to regulate a substance december 8 2006 congre lastly on this point and to further buttress the point that this bill is a deliberately different way of handling chemicals than the way they are now treated under existing federal environmental law the sponsors of this bill and i recognize that implementation legislation for these international agreements is a distinct context in which to amend unitedstates law recognizing that the underlying statutes being amended address the very broad and p9werful reach of the federal government into unitedstates manufacturing this legislation is solely intended to allow the united states to be able to participate fully in these agreements to the extent that it wishes the sponsors and i do not intend for the regulatory standards outlined in this bill whether singularly or as a package to be a blanket precedent for other environmental legislation future congresses should be very careful in assessing the environmental public health and other social and economic needs of the country before copying this standard because of the unique circumstances and purposes to which this legislation is tied second consistent with the structures and rules of the pops convention ihis legislation places unitedstates officials laws and standardsnot those of an unelected and unaccountable international bodyin charge of determining what specific control measures the united states should take treatiesjust like allieschange and it is hard to predict their future as the newly elected vice president of the nato parliamentary assembly i see countries use environmental and safety laws as nontariff trade barriers in fact we need not look any further than the world trade organization case involving genetically modified organisms or gmo crops for an example of how the european union tried to use its laws to bar market access for our farmers i believe it is reasonable to suggest that in the same way that environmental and labor groups argued that added environment and labor considerations must not be divorced from trade agreements such as nafta and gatt you also cannot ignore that economic and labor issues need to play a role when countries enact environmental laws a minority of stakeholders in this country are unhappy with the chemicals policy of the present administration and support using a legal standard in this country that flows straight from these treaties and has the control measures also directed by the international treaty parties not the united states this type of effort not only removes the executive branch from involvementthe state department has testified in opposition to this type of regimebut also the legislative branch from the process of considering the impact on unitedstates interests and laws ultimately in this construct the judicial branch becomes the sole arbiter of rights and interpreter of obligations under these agreementsa place the framers of the unitedstates constitution never intended in addition these same persons want to use a judicial review standard that merely ratifies rather than questions the regulatory decisions of the executive branch this circular argument on their part not only diminishes judicial reviewwhich their proposals pose as the supreme avenue to set and resolve policybut further reinforces a desire to have unitedstates environmental and manufacturing policy set in foreign capitals the legislation i am introducing today rightfully recognizes that these agreements will ssional record extensions of remarks be law long after the current president is out of office and congress should not and cannot pass reactionary legislation simply to hem in one leader it is our obligation to pass the best legislation that will serve our country and its interests under every leader this bill does that third the public should be fully informed about actions being taken under these agreements and congress should be informed when conflicts with existing environmental statutes occur neither the public nor congress should be prevented from providing input to our government about structures that are going to affect our lives simply because it is inconvenient history will show that cooperation between parties has allowed our treaties to function more successfully than when either congress or the public is cut out this contains public notice and comment throughout th6 entire treaty process including the regulation of chemicals as part or our countrys desire to optin fourth this legislation preserves the existing public petition process under the administrative procedure act and provides certainty to all americans as to what rights and obligations they would have we must not forget that we have both a mature chemical industry and a wellestablished set of legal nghts and responsibilities that are the envy of most countries this bill draws onnot adds tothe wellfounded petition processes in all environmental laws and maintainsunamendedthe current federalstate dynamic in all environmental laws most importantly nothing in this bill affects any other environmental statute or state delegated programs under those other statutes or any other environmental board constituted outside of tsca fifth sound objective peerreviewed science should be at the core of any decisions made by the united states under these treaties i believe we need to focus our finite resources on the most pressing problems not disproportionately or fully on every problem we face without regard to context currently an assessment of risks and effects is called for in other environmental statutes and is not unprecedented in addition the legislation being introduced today amends a provision contained in section 2 of h r 4591 that created a new tsca section 503 e 4 that relied on a determination by the epa administrator of the weight of the evidence when making a regulatory determination regarding restrictions on newly added pops chemicals it requires the epa administrator to use sound and objective scientific practices the best available science and to describe in the rulemaking record the quality of the scientific information on which the administrator based a decision to take action against a pops or lratp pops chemical substance or mixture sixth this legislation alters no existing rights and responsibilities of the states under federal chemicals laws first every right obligation and opportunity of the states that exists under tsca are still available to the states some including several democrat state attorneys general who were up for reelection have argued that states would be precluded from legislating or litigating around the federal government in a way that they can do now nothing could be further from the truth second even if one were to accept the argument that states should be able to act any way they e2205 want we should not forget that this is a treaty and that states should not unwittingly put the united states out of compliance with its obligations under these agreements through their own enactments and the state department has written to me that we should not allow that to happen finally to clarify concerns raised about potential preemotion possibilities in the face of longstanding state department practicethat the united states not agree to new treaty obligations unless our country has the legal authorities in place to comply with those obligations section 6 e of this legislation provides that any federal preemption of state laws cannot occur unless a rule or order implementing our obligation has been issued under this act and has gone final or become effective concurrently section 2 of this bill requires in new tsca section 506 that no regulation issued under this authority can become effective unless the united states consents to be bound to a treaty obligation regarding that chemical substance or mixture seventh and finally while this legislation is careful to ensure that only unitedstates officials are the drivers of decisions affecting our nation and its citizensa feature expressly guaranteed by these treatiesi also want to point out that this legislation also recognizes the global nature of this treaty and the important contributions that other countries may make to inform our decisions section 2 of this legislation establishes a new tsca section 503 e 2 b that allows the epa administrator to use internationally generated information or scientific studies so long as they meet the scientific soundness and objectivity criteria in this legislation in assessing the statutory considerations regarding the domestic regulation of a new pops or lrtap pops chemical substance or mixture furthermore new tsca section 503 e 2 v of section 2 requires domestic consideration of national ahd international consequences that are likely to arise as a result of domestic regulatory action including the possible consequences of using alternative products or processes in doing so this provisions use of the word consequences is not meant to automatically imply negative connotations but rather that the epa administrator is to look at the national and international positive and negative benefits that would flow from domestic regulatory action that being said the inclusion of this provision is in no way meant to give new legal rights or standing to foreignbased entities in unitedstates courts regarding unitedstates domestic regulatory actions under this legislation or the international environmental accords that this legislation implements this legislation is a true compromise that represents the middle ground on treaty implementation legislation and a place where most americans believe our policy should be if the united states is to remain a leader in the global environmental debate it must have legislation that fully implements these treaties the time has come for us to make a difference in global environmental protection from the most toxic of chemical substances and mixtures i urge congress to pass this legislation as soon as is practicable and make a strong statement of our national resolve to tackle these matters rather than place mere words behind our commitments"], [0.9959976673126221, 0.9959976673126221, 0, "i ask unanimous consent that during further consideration of h r 2419 in the committee

world has failed the people of darfur i commend the quick and generous response to the tsunami but we must not only focus on disasters as they occur but also to respond to disasters like in darfur that have gone on for decades the peace agreement between the north and south opens new doors for a comprehensive peace throughout the country and dr john garang who will now be vice president of

of the subcommittee on commerce justice state judiciary and related agencies of the committee on appropriations all unitedstates assessments to the u n have been paid in full but over the past year we have seen the united nations fight an uphill battle on darfur resolution after resolution has failed to have any impact at least two security council members china and russia have threatened to veto strong resolutions from being passed secretary general kofi annan continues to report that the situation in darfur continues to deteriorate and the government of sudan has violated the previous security council resolutions by failing to disarm and prosecute the janjaweed ngos are leaving the region secretary general annan has sent a commission on inquiry to darfur to investigate if genocide has occurred and he has the report in his hands as i speak most people believe there is genocide but whether or not they use that term it still is horrible what is taking place and no matter what you call it the facts remain innocent civilians are systematically being murdered raped and displaced and the world has failed to stop it it is time for the united nations and the international community to respond in a meaningful way i ask secretary general annan to go to darfur to confirm with his own eyes that the situation has not improved then secretary general annan should make bold recommendations and call on the security council to immediately implement them because a strong meaningful resolution should be put forward and could make a difference it is now time for secretary general annan to use his strong moral leadership he is a nobel peace prize recipient and surely the security council would take his recommendations he should use his power and prestige to plead for the people of darfur and if the security council fails to take meaningful action secretary general annan should resign in protest i am not blaming kofi annan for darfur he does not control the security council but i ask him to use his leadership to demand a new course of action from them i believe these actions could turn the attention of the world back to what is taking place in darfur resigning under protest is an act of great moral leadership and this world would respect his actions great men in history have given up their posts to force change in 1973 at the height of the watergate scandal president nixon ordered attorney general elliott richardson to fire the special prosecutor he refused and resigned in protest and later got the presidential medal of freedom william wilberforce a member of the british parliament he could have been prime minister but spoke out to abolish the slave trade and gave up being prime minister of england anything kofi annan can do to get the world to focus on darfur would be greatly admired if in the year 2005 the security council cannot deal with genocide the raping of women and the systematic burning of villages now occurring then i

foreign minister george yeo recently said that southeast asia may need to distance itself from burma if it does not undergo political reform and the asean leaders refused to let burma become chairman of the important regional organization in 2006 the european union has also firmly resisted the entreaties of the european commercial classalways eager for new trade opportunities with the worlds rogue

convince the international community to act properly the only hope for promoting farreaching political change is by making burmas thugocracy pay an economic price for running their nation into the ground i would welcome a negotiated solution to the crisis in burma but i believe firmly that such negotiations will only bear fruit once those pulling the levers of power feel a strong economic pinch today we will act decisively to renew import sanctions against burma and send an unmistakable signal of support for the restoration of democracy and human rights in that impoverished nation one day aung san suu kyi will lead a democratic burma and i look forward to being at her inauguration before a throng of her countrymen all finally free until then we in this country must do what we can to hasten that day i urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation"], [0.0007648766040802002, 0.4992351233959198, 1, "i want to commend my good friend from texas for yet another

the conference report and congratulate the chair and ranking member of the subcommittee on foreign operations for their leadership in crafting this important legislation and for their work in ensuring that crucial national security priorities are appropriately funded even as our troops are still engaged in combat in afghanistan and iraq new challenges to our nations security and diplomatic interests are emerging this bill does a good job of meeting these challenges within the confines of an extremely tight budgetary environment i am particularly pleased that the conference agreement includes 75 million in assistance to armenia and 3 million for nagomo karabagh the conferees also agreed to maintain the military assistance parity between armenia and azerbaijan by approving 5 million in foreign millitary financing fmf and 75d 000 1i international military education and trainifi imet for both countries through these appropriations the conferees have continued to advance the political and economic development of the caucasus while also increasing stability in the region i was also heartened to see that the conferees continued this countrys longstanding support for our democratic ally israel by providing 2 5 billion in assistance for israel including 2 3 billion for military grants and 240 million in economic assistance at the same time the congress has wisely met the presidents request for 150 million for development programs for palestinians in the west bank ard gaza 75 million more than the current level only by helping the palestinian people to break the cycle of poverty and hopelessness can we hope to realize the vision of a twostate solution to decades of conflict between israel and the palestinians i believe that it is wise that our assistance to the palestinians goes to private voluntary organizations 20 percent or to contractors 80 percent all of which are selected and monitored by usaid while i hope that abu mazen will be able to end the corruption in the pa i think that it is prudent that the unitedstates forego direct transfers to the pa until there is greater transparency and accountability this has been a difficult year for our relationship with egypt even as cairo has proven a valuable partner in helping to facilitate the israeli pullout from gaza the countrys moves towards democracy have been halting i think that this bill properly funds our priorities by appropriating 1 8 billion in aid for egypt 1 3 billion for military grants and 495 million in economic assistance with 50 million of the economic assistance directed to programs that promote democracy and human rights and 50 million be for education including 5 million for scholarships for disadvantaged egyptian students at a time when the united states is viewed with skepticism and outright hostility in many parts of the world foreign assistance and disaster relief is one of the most effective ways to change negative views of our country in the wake of the tsunami last december and the october 8 earthquake in pakistan the generosity of the american people has been a strong force for advancing our national interests abroad even as we wrestled with the aftermath of a devastating series of hurricanes here at home as the congress and the president begin to work on the fiscal year 2007 budget for foreign operations i hope that we will remember that feeding the hungry healing the sick and helping those left homeless by natures fury can play an important role in making the united states more secure and more respected by the rest of the world again

in return is to show them honor and respect when they come home according to the greensboro heraldjournal middle school teacher michael lund of anita white carson middle school in greensboro georgia had that intention when he invited his old college roommate marine sgt zach richardson to speak to his middle school students about his experiences in iraq the children in mr lunds class had been pen pals with sergeant richardson and several of his fellow marines in iraq so everyone was excited about finally getting to meet in person imagine the surprise when he and mr lund were intercepted outside the classroom by school principal ulrica corbett she demanded mr lund escort sergeant richardson off school grounds immediately principal corbett later told the media that mr lund did not have approval for a guest speaker to come on campus mr lund produced documentation to prove that he had indeed filed the necessary paperwork well in advance and that principal corbett refused to act on it regardless of the reason this treatment of one of our heroes returning from iraq is unacceptable and inexcusable under no circumstances should sergeant richardson have been denied the opportunity to speak to the students with whom he had been corresponding but just as damaging as the disrespect shown to sergeant richardson was the impact of this disrespect on the 6th grade students who were waiting to welcome this veteran they witnessed their principal kick a marine just back from the front off school property giving our children a reallife lesson in disrespecting our military we have a lesson to teach at anna white carson middle schooland across this country that lesson should be that disrespect for americas service men and women by public officials will simply not be tolerated by the people of this country but before we scream too loudly about the speck in the eye of greene county public schools we need to take a look at the log in the eye of this congress senator dick durbin of illinois stood on the floor of our senate and compared our military prisons to those of nazi germany members of this congress have whined about whether a book was mistreated at guantanamo while the comrades of those guantanamo prisoners cut the heads off innocent unarmed civilian prisoners in their custody any reasonable person can see that comments such as these plant seeds of disdain against america here and abroad are these comments and actions against our military forces now actually encouraging new attacks by our enemies in london and baghdad we cannot win this war if we continue to allow a handful of public officials to undermine our efforts with irresponsible comments and actions without paying a pricehereand all across our country"], [0.002499818801879883, 0.5024998188018799,
