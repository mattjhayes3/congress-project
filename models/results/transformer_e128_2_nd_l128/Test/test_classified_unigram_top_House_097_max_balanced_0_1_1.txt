offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.002636849880218506, 0.9973631501197815, 1, "i join with

the bully pulpit of a congressional office to help protect the consumers and workers of america he has shown us how to use a subcommittee to investigate shed light and arouse public concern over key environmental and energy issues his work on toxic wastes energy and auto efficiency unwise public works projects and the havoc which would be wreaked by an oil import fee have helped improve the lives

about my colleagues good works as a subcommittee chairman and in dealing with the environment dealing with his ability to use oversight as a tool that worked well to talk about something that bothers me and that tony did well he did it so well that i thought about this in this sense if you think about a political leaderand i tried to think about somebody as i extend my remarks who talked about the importance of what one person could do and so if you will bear with me for a minutea person who some years ago talked about the futility of being one man and he suggested that if we all gave in and said that we could not make changes in the world because it was futile we should look at martin luther king or we should look at martin luther as a practical matter if we would give in to expediency and say that if that was a cause for us to not want to make changeswe should look at those people who in the expediency of giving in to politics gave in to the camps of dachau and auschwitz and we did not give inmany people did not then you could look at the other danger this person said and we could give in to the concerns of temerity and say that many of us did not wish to be laughed at and so we would not take a chance and risk the temerity or take the temerity and risk the chance of being laughed at by our colleagues and the other great danger this colleague of ours of some years back said was the risk of comfort which toby did not have tony did not have the comfort of an education paid for by his parents or toby did not have the comfort of a great deal of outside income and many people could use that comfort to not take a chance if you have a great deal of education a great deal of income you do not have to risk fighting so as our friend said the futility the expediency the temerity the comfort all those things could deny one person from trying to change the course of the world and if you did not risk greatly you could not achieve greatly now the person who said that and i wish it could have been me was a person who i am sure both toby and i admire it was robert kennedy when he finished his book in march of 1968 and he wrote those words in los angeles just before he was assassinated but i think back on it and i think that those apply to toby who was willing to risk greatly to achieve greatly we will miss him those of us who may not risk as greatly as we would like he did achieve greatly and i think that will go on his record and i think we will all admire him for that in addition to that we will miss him as a friend we will miss his wife myra and little mary ellen

atlanta ga is clearly indicative of the sickness which is eroding the fibers of our society violence is becoming more and more a way of life throughout our nation the atlanta slayings and related attacks against children are very cogent symbols that we are moving further away from the highest regard for human life it frightens me deeply to acknowledge the significant psychological damage which is growing among all children due to the recent incidences while the victims of these murders have all been black it is no secret that such acts of violence do not discriminate the fundamental question we must face now is that any child may be forced to live in fear during every phase of a days activity surely the increased number of weaponcarrying schoolchildren momentary periods of panic if a parent is late picking up a schoolchild and decrease in academic achievement are not peculiar to the findings of several atlanta psychiatrists psychologists and mental health officials the feelings of distrust fear and apprehension wih spread among all of our nations children as they begin ti dread functioning in everyday environments this is a sad outlook for our future another fundamental question which is magnifici in the minds of those who fear for human safety is the continuing focus away from human needs we are forced now to question if whether or not the evils of poverty deprivation and unemployment may be so deep rooted in our society that respect for human life becomes secondary to mere survival we are also forced to question the validity of continuous violence as romanticized and glamourized on our television and movie screens the situations in georgia florida maryland and throughout most regions in this country leave us frustrated and angry they leave us to question the basic responsiveness of authorities who must become more adamant in the protection of human lives however they must not lead us to take the law into our own hands the widespread acts of violence must also remind us that the protection and preservation of human lives are crossjurisdictional when as many as 21 lives are lost it cannot be pegged as a state or local government matter both the president and the congress realized this and i laud the dispersal of federal funds to atlanta and the efforts to appropriate 1 5 and 1 8 million for use by this city we have to examine closely the cli mate that motivates and encourages psychotic violence the violence of racism the aforementioned influence of television and movies and the violence of war and militarismall of these inevitably get reflected in individual behavior to a greater or lesser degree he psychotic killers who murder our children in atlanta or any where else are victims of this climate and have apparently been affected to a greater degree we cannot excuse this behavior however we can and must deal squarely with the environment which fosters such actions several sociologists tell us that most of the slain atlanta children come from public housing neighborhoods which are more vulnerable and conducive to human mistreatment abduction and even death such conditions and incidences are not limited to this region of the country right here in washington d c children from lowincome housing projects are becoming more and more susceptible to conditions of drug abuse and molestation here the elimination of unemployment underemployment and poverty must precede the eradication of such criminal acts it is not easy to warn the blacks of atlanta to stay away from theories that the acts of violence against 21 black children are conspiratorial in nature or racially motivated the pattern of systematic murders rapes additional overt and covert actions against black citizens in the south and throughout this country is still just too prevalent however we must assist in the efforts of mayor maynard jackson the numerous task forces and concerned cftizens in addressing the problem in a rational way again until we eliminate the fundamental societal ills we cannot be shocked at deviant behavioral patterns of violence irresponsibility and total disregard for human lives there is little help in calling on citizens to care about each other when increasing inequities among neighborhoods schools living standards and opportunities have become a way of life those of us who are in a position to have impact on public policy must stand firm against further inequities and burdens on our children elderly and lowincome citizens we must promote the kind of solidarity which has been displayed as citizens across the nation have rallied behind the victimized atlanta families most importantly we must not be afraid to oppose and openly attack racism chronic unemployment poverty

comments admiral laroche of the center for defense information quoted lord mountbatten the brilliant british military person who said in 1979 i have come to the conclusion that nuclear weapons are not military weapons because nuclear weapons cannot be used and the danger that imperils humankind on the face of this earth is the perception the illusion that nuclear weapons can be used to me this was an eloquent and powerful statement that nuclear weapons are never to be used but only for deterrence but the supporting documents for this military budget fiscal year 1983 say we must have the capacity to fight to survive and win a nuclear war anyone who believes we can fight survive and win a nuclear war bydefinition with all due respect is psychotic every analyst i have seen indicates that no one wins in a nuclear war there is no such as a limited war a surgical strike where 20 to 100 million human beings are dead what is limited and surgical about that i would quote dr geiger the executive director of the physicians for social responsibility who said as i look at the united states and the soviet union and their nuclear arms race i think of two men and i think that is appropriate because it is very sexist and macho to play war gamestwo men in a room locked tight up to their throats in gasoline one standing there with 10 matches and the other standing there with 7 matches and they are both arguing over whether they need 15 matches apiece before they can agree not to strike 1 match in that room that is where we are that is precisely where this arms race is millions of the american people are beginning to awaken to the reality that nuclear war is insanity bloated wasteful and unnecessary military budgets are not in our best interests finally my colleagues are talking about a 5percent addon for fiscal year 1983 military budget as if these numbers make some sense the point is that fiscal year 1982 was an incredibly high base in fiscal year 1981 the military budget in budget authority terms was 173 billion in fiscal year 1982 it went up to 226 billion 25 percent over and above that is incredible we must remember that ronald reagan stomped us in 1982 and put the military budget at an incredible level so let me give the members these figures because it also includes the black caucus budget when you go back to 1981 as a base 1982 which was terribly out of line the jones budget if we use 1981 figures calls for 32 9percent increase in 2 years the aspin budget in 2 years calls for a 31 3percent increase the latta budget 33 4percent increase in the military budget in 2 years the obey budget 30 6 percent and even this socalled radical document known as the congressional black caucus that budget is still 25 percent over and above fiscal year 1981 a 12 5 average increase in 2 years so yoticannot tell me or any other rational human being that we are not pouring an incredible amount of money in our military budget in

reason why i have adopted a goslow philosophy toward an olympic coin program based on such a large number of coins while the income projections on a 25 or 17coin program may look attractive it must be

down a deadend street of believing in what president reagan calls the magic of the marketplace empirical evidence of six recessions in the postwar period resulting from similar tight monetary and regressive fiscal policies now being pursued documents the fallacy of feeding the fat and starving the lean economics for those who care to think objectively and to heed commonsense i am inserting into the record the report of the national advisory council on economic opportunity a governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice

volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [0.004096925258636475, 0.9959030747413635, 1, "i think it is time to put the social security issue into perspective as a result of the reagan administrations scare tactics the public is confused and worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax bill"], [0.004153072834014893, 0.9958469271659851, 1, "we are beginning with this general debate a very historic process which i believe will result in the most dramatic and substantial change in federal fiscal policy that has occurred in this country in the last 50 years whether we are democrat or republican i think all of us read what the american people were demanding last november they asked that there be serious restraint on the growth of federal spending and that we get our fiscal house in order the alternatives before us today regardless of which one you are talking about have a substantial dramatic change in federal fiscal policy from the outset i would like to reiterate what i stated when i asked my colleagues to elect me chairman of the committee on the budget and that is this that the funandgames time for the budget process is over if you want to continue the budget process then we ought to build a budget based on reality build a budget that will stand the test of time and pass a budget which we will support when the individual authorizing and appropriations bills come before the house of representatives i think we have the lattakemproth substitute or the republican substitute and the committee bill present a clear choice in many respects of ways to proceed on budget policy quite frankly i have been somewhat disturbed by reports that some of our colleagues say for political or other reasons they are going to support this or that alternative but that it really does not mean anything because when they come back to the authorizing votes and to the appropriating votes they will vote the other way what i want to set out from the very beginning is that so long as i am chairman of the committee on the budget i intend to do everything in my power to make the budget process realno more fun and gamesso that those who vote for the budget resolutions will know what is in those resolutionsand they will be expected to vote the same way when the individual authorizing and appropriating bills come before the house many people think that they can vote one way because of the immediate political pressure on them but that the pressure will be off 1 week from now 2 weeks from now 1 month from now i think it is incumbent upon every member of this body to know what is in these resolutions to know what they are voting on what they are cutting and what kind of tax program they are providing because those who look to you on this vote will be looking to you on subsequent votes to be consistent if you think you get out from under the pressure by casting a vote one way today and changing it the next time you are not going to do it because the same interest groups that are after you today will be after you tomorrow and you will look worse by being inconsistent so i hope that you will make it a point to know what is in these various alternatives some of the reports i have heard that my colleagues indicate that they may support the republican substitute they should keep in mind that it really does include the kemproth tax bill and there is no way to get around it the president of the united states just a few days ago from this chamber said that the tax program the kemproth tax program was integral to his program that there would be no compromise no alternative so those of you who vote for the latta republican substitute are voting for the kemproth tax bill and you ought to know it some say that a vote for the latta substitute does not include any kind of severe cuts in elementary and secondary education that is wrong the substitute includes deep cuts 25 percent cuts in elementary and secondary education and most of those cuts are going to affect education for handi capped children and you ought to know it some who have indicated that they may support the republican substitute say that that does not mean that we are not going to provide for filling the strategic petroleum reserve and that is not true the substitute cuts the support for the strategic petroleum reserve by 75 percent there is no way to get around it and you ought to know it when you vote the substitute i might also add will raise a point of order against the appropriation of 3 billion for the strategic petroleum reserve that is pending and ready to come to thenfoor of the house next week and you ought to know it some say that they may support the republican substitute but that it does not contain any cuts in vocational education or job training and that is not true it cuts vocational education it cuts job training and you ought to know it all i am saying is whether you are talking about the cuts in agricultural programs the cuts in job training the cuts in education or the kemproth tax bill if you feel you want to support that i will never question any member of this body on that decision you have your own reasons and you ought to vote for those reasons all i am saying is let us be consistent let us be honest with the american people and you vote today as you are going to vote for the rest of this year on the 1982 budget the budget committee will be keeping with the responsibilities we have a scorecard as to where we are and that scorecard is going to be embarrassing for some people if they are not consistent as the year goes on so that is one of the first points i wanted to make that is that i take my responsibility as chairman of this committee on the budget very seriously and whatever this body passes i will attempt to enforce to the letter now i want briefly to state how the committee resolution got to its present form because it was not a happen stance event it was guided by a number of principles and a number of goals that i personally had and the committee had a number of goals that were laid out after i was elected chairman of this committee the overriding goal that directed my attention was to put together a budget that would truly lessen the pressures on inflation unless we keep that goal uppermost we are npt responding to what the american people said they wanted in the elections last november what can we do to get inflation down another goal was to try to limit federal spending as a percent of gross national product many of you recall and some of you cosponsored the efforts we made in the last congress to start limiting federal spending and the first step was to limit federal spending to 22 5 percent of gnp that goal was achieved in this committee resolution as a matter of fact we actually cut spending more in aggregate terms than the administration recommended in its march 10 budget a third overriding goal was to recommend a tax policy designed to meet the needs of our country and the american people today in that connection we looked at various tax programs and compared kemproth to other possibilities and we found over and over again that the kemproth tax bill would in effect a keynesian consumptionoriented tax policy it would stimulate demand there is no question about it"], [0.004315018653869629, 0.9956849813461304,

raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary

wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg

provisions which were referred to the judiciary committee and to which the subcommittee on monopolies and commercial law gave long and careful consideration there were times when i and others felt that our consideration was becoming altogether too long and too careful but the bill which we have ultimately reported is a good one and merits the support of every member it is difficult to discuss this legislation without some reference to h r 5235 formerly h r 2326 the bill introduced by chairman rodino and myself to clarify the application of the antitrust laws to export trade activities this was our initial response to the complaint that many american businessmen were unwilling or unable to compete with confidence in the international marketplace because of their uncertainty regarding their antitrust liability that bill reflects our belief that the proper response to exporters who believe the law is unclear is to clarify the law this it seems to me is far more important than the licensing procedures such as the provisions in the export trading legislation passed by the senate as the rodinomcclory bill has moved forward it became evident that nothing less than some sort of certification system was desired by the business community even if h r 5235 were to be enacted clarifying the nonapplication of our antitrust laws to purely foreign activities title ii of h r 1799 is the judiciary committees considered response it compares extremely favorably with the senate approach i might say in terms of simplified procedure expedit0ed processing and certain results it provides exporters with a binding advisory opinion on the legality of their proposed conduct rather than providing an outright antitrust exemption as the senate bill attempts to do this eliminates also the cumbersome requirement that exporters establish a special need as a condition precedent to exemption the 6nly issue to be decided in processing an application under our bill is whether the proposed conduct is likely to violate the antitrust laws of the united states the members of the monopolies and commercial law subcommittee were virtually unanimous therefore in deciding that this determination should be made by the department of justice rather than by the department of commerce there would seem to be little benefit conferred by an antitrust certificate from the department of commerce which the department of justice could attack and it would be wrong to bar the antitrust division from exercising its enforcement function in my opinion without its first having the opportunity to subject the proposed conduct to antitrust review an optional forwarding role for the commerce department is allowed nevertheless which should encourage the applicant to use that agencys informational and advisory services careful thought was also given to the question of damages which may be recovered by a person injured by an antitrust violation committed by a person acting pursuant to a certificate there is no question of course that treble damages lie for conduct outside of the certificate it is also possile however although unlikely that certified conduct may result in injury in domestic commerce although the administration and the senate have suggested that certified conduct should be totally immune from liability the judiciary committee of the house firmly believes that single damages are most necessary and appropriate it is sometimes forgotten that antitrust damages are not only a penalty but a protection and the person compensated most often will be another american business with a legitimate clair to be made whole for its antitrust injury single damages for domestic injury by the holder of an export trade certificate were perceived as a fair compromise between the traditional statutory treble damages and no damages if no damages were to be the rule the governmental agency granting certification would have to be more conservative in close cases granting benefits to fewer applicants furthermore fairness would also then require that greater procedural protections be provided for interested parties who feared future injury since such parties would subsequently be denied damages on the other hand with single damages as the rule certification could take place administratively without a hearing without third parties arguing their case and thus without protracted delays finally if no damages were to be the rule the only way a court could compensate the injured american business would be to hold the conduct in question to be ultra vires outside the certificate in which case treble damages would lie with a singledamages rule however the court would have a fairer solution availableone which compensates the injured party but does not punish the wrongdoer who believed that his conduct fell within the scope of the certificate some have argued that the senate bill is preferable because it protects exporters from lawsuits by providing zero damages rather than single damages where certified conduct causes the complained of injury but our committee has given this argument a long hard look talked to antitrust lawyers and found this argument without merit for the senate bill would only change the nature of pleading antitrust violations and probably result in treble damage awards on grounds that the conduct in question was ultra vires our bill would preserve and assure single damages for the injured plaintiff but would restrain the filing of lawsuits against exporters by means of the most liberal provision of attorneys fees for defendants within the sweep of my experience for if the certified conduct has not violated the antitrust laws the plaintiff must pay to the defendant exporter a reasonable attorneys fee even if the suit was brought in good faith and even if the suit was nonfrivolous that should make plaintiffs think twice about suing an exporter holding a certificate this bill has been carefully constructed to provide greater certainty to exporters by providing them the assurance of an antitrust review and certification procedure i believe it will enable american businessmen to compete with far greater confidence and freedom of action overseas this is what you want it is what i want and it is what our national interest requires having worked this long and come this far i look forward to an early and

reported from the subcommittee and from the full committee with overwhelming bipartisan support and it strikes that delicate balance between fiscal restraint and adequate support for the necessary and worthwhile research and service activities of noaa i want to note my admiration for the strong leadership of the gentleman from florida the chairman of the science and technology committee i would also like to commend the gentleman from kansas the ranking minority member of the committee for his support of our efforts i also am particularly indebted not only to my democratic colleagues on the subcommittee but also to the gentleman from new york for his tireless work in effecting a responsible and workable authorization bill for noaa in a truly bipartisan way we could not have had a more diligent and cooperative colleague as ranking minority member of the subcommittee the atmospheric climatic and ocean pollution act authorizes 498 543 000 for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to conduct essential research and service activities in a wide variety of areas including weather forecasting climatic services tornado and hurricane warnings aviation weather ocean dumping research and atmospheric research included in this authorization figure are 2 2 million for reauthorization of the national climate program act and 5 1 million for noaa to operate a land remote sensing system from space landsat this is a bill which is responsive to our recognition of this nations budgetary problemsthe authorization figure in the bill is 4 000 below the administrations request h r 2803 marks the beginning of a new relationship between congress and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa was established by executive reorganization in 1970 with the mission of providing services and research in the sea and in the air over the past 11 years numerous environmental statutes have given naa additional duties so that the agency is now responsible for weather forecasting acid rain research fisheries conservation the national sea grant program the national ocean pollution office the national climate office conservation of muxine mammals and sensitive marine habitats and many more programs which the congress and the american people have regarded as legitimate and important government services throughout these 11 years the congress has voted on numerous occasions to authorize noaa to carry out a proscribed environmental responsibility however we in the congress have never reviewed and evaluated the missions and programs of this important agency as a whole with the view of understanding how its components ought to relate to each other and to the needs of the people we on the committee on science and technology for instance feel strongly that the primary mission of noaas weather arm ought to be protection of the public health and safety through timely and accurate weather forecasts and warnings however in the heat of the appropriations process it is easy for members for those evaluating these services and for the weather service itself to lose sight of the absolute primacy of the publics health and safety in setting priorities for the weather service i am confident that consideration of a comprehensive authorization bill for noaa will provide members with a good opportunity to review and if necessary reorder the agencys priorities and that this process will help noaa to keep its programs in tune with the needs of the public h r 2803 is the first step in a process which i hope will culminate in an authorization bill for the entire agency the bill authorizes funding for approximately 500 million of the agencys 800 million budget including all of its weather climatic and oceanpollution activities the noaa activities not included in this billfisheries sea grant ocean thermal energy and hard minerals development are under the jurisdiction of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries and we on the committee on science anbd technology are confident that in future years the two committees will report to the house a comprehensive authorization bill for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in reporting h r 2803 the committee on science and technology increased funding above the administrations request for a limited number of noaa activities funding for these programs was increased either because they promise to provide needed informational services to policymakers or the public and they embody a critical transfer of research technology which will greatly enhance the usefulness of the service provided with respect to information services h r 2803 contains 500 000 for noaa to begin a comparative study of the environmental effects of waste disposal in various medialand sea and air there is increasing pressure to open up the ocean once again for disposal of wastes however because of the short sighted approach of federal agencies in the past crucial crossmedia comparisons of environmental impact have never been made so that the environmental protection agency must regulate waste disposal without an adequate understanding of what the relative impact of various disposal optionsl might be the committee feels that the most appropriate target for a pioneering study of this sort is the sewage sludge disposal problem in the new york city metropolitan area the bill also contains funding above the administrations request for upgrading the climatological data base at the national climatic center and for enhanced funding of the national climate program office both of these increases are based on the recommendations of the national academy of sciences the national climate offices 5year plan and our own committee that the greatest nearterm improve ment that can be made in our national climate effort would be to improve the accessibility and use of the data already available in government archives effective use of climatic data is an essential element in agricultural productivity and water management with regard to technology transfer h r 2803 includes enhanced funding for several projects which are expected to greatly improve the weather services ability to warn the public of severe weather the committee feels that the greatest challenge facing the weather service in the coming years will be in providing services particularly severeweather warnings in the face of stable or shrinking personnel levels thus in h r 2903 our committee strongly supported those projects which showed either promise for improving detection of severe weather or promise of automating routine functions a modest investment in capital equipment can produce substantial savings in labor and free up the time of skilled personnel in the weather service to perform important forecasting tasks we supported automation of field operations and services afos but agree with the committee on appripriations that a successful test of the system is needed before increased expenditures are warranted at this time funding was provided to accelerate design of the next generation radar nexrad system the weather service currently uses the outmoded and rapidly failing wsr57 radars built in the 1950s delay of nexrad would be a false savings in that it would lead to severely reduced service and to greatly increased maintenance costs additional funds were provided for testing and installing automated observing systems which will eventually be placed at over 500 airports to form the backbone of the groundbased observational network this program has the potential to free personnel to perform more critical forecast and service functions and any delay in this program would result in greatly reduced productivity finally the bill recommends enhanced funding for the national severe storms center in kansas city for its centralized storm information system csis csis allows the forecaster to integrate data from satellites radar and other observing systems at a finer scale than is presently possible and is recognized to be the most promising development in the detection of severe storms since the refinement of doppler radar in this bill the committee also strongly supported the administrations request of 1 876 000 for research in the sources and transport of acid rain this is a substantial increase from the 1981 appropriation for acid rain research which was under 100 000 acid rain is responsible for the biological sterility of hundreds of lakes in the northeastern united states and in canada and may fit the present time or in the near future be responsible for literally billions of dollars of damage to forests and to crops to metal and stone structures of all sorts and to human health in our hearings this year we had testimony that not only will the northeast and canada continue to be severely afflicted with the problems of acid rain absent a major intervention on our part but that also the west coast and the upper middle west are threatened with the poisonous problem of acid rain on their croplands on their forestlands on their waters and on their structures in the near future the administrations request for acid rain research was timely for several reasons including the importance of this issue to the clean air act reauthorization and the designation of noaa as a lead ageney in acid rain research by the energy security act of we have all observed from the newspapers that when president reagan visited canada shortly after he took office it was made very clear to him that acid rain was a matter of urgent concern to our canadian friends more recently i was a member of a group of american congressmen and senators who met with our canadian colleagues members of parliament and their environment minister in halifax and again it was made clear to us beyond a peradventure that the problem of acid rain and our contribution to their problem was a matter of most urgent concern to them so i congratulate president reagan and the administration for having requested a significant and timely increase in the budget to look into the question of acid rain in a comprehensive and holistic fashion i fully agree with the administration that we ought to know far more than we do now what will be the costs and benefits of our efforts to use inexpensive sources of fuel in terms of our environment and natural resources we should have information as to whether a given expenditure in scrubbing coal for instance will lead to a linear reduction of emissions and to improvements in the atmosphere and the fact is that today we do not know we need far more accurate information to make intelligent decisions from the point of view of cost and benefits when we pass legislation imposing major expenditures upon our utilities and upon our manufacturing industries this increase in the budget for acid rain research is totally consistent with this administrations concern that we make more thoughtful decisions affecting the regulatory process and it reflects also the presidents own experience in meeting with canadian leaders and the experience of this congress reflecting the very high priority that we put on a thoughtful logical and workable approach to reducing the problems of acid rain so i do congratulate the administration and the president and i congratulate my colleague the gentleman from new york for the role that he played in bringing them to this very intelligent and useful decision let me say a few words about section 4 of h r 2803 which provides noaa with 5 1 million to plan for develop and operate a civilian land observing system landsat in an era of resource scarcity our committee believes that the ability to obtain and interpret space remote sensing data and thus to locate and manage natural resources is of major importance our committee believes that a finite period of operation by the federal government would greatly mininize the technical financial and institutional risks involved in developing landsat would preserve our national leadership and ultimately would enable the private sector to operate a sound land remote sensing system in closing h r 2803 provides money for a large number of essential atmospheric and oceanic activities i urge my colleagues to support these programs and i recommend h r 2803 for immediate passage from the full house and again i commend my colleague the gentleman from new york for his highly professional and nonpartisan and thoughtful approach to this legislation and his support for

in congress for his whirlwind dynamism and tireless unswerving commitment to ending world hunger harry chapin inspired an invigorating confidence that it was possible for policies and programs to be changed that the energies resources and great talents of our nation could be mobilized to breathe a fresh new life into the great humanitarian principles for which we want our nation to stand in one of his many finely crafted probing ballads harry queried now if a man tried to take his time on earth and prove before he died what one mans life could be worth well i wonder what would happen to this world during his short lifetime harry proved to so many people what his life was worth he was vision confidence inspiration unbridled energy and selfless dedication to others and his life matteredhe made a difference he constantly reminded us that hundreds of millions of people suffer from hunger and malnutrition that hunger makes every day for them a struggle whether or not their plight makes the nightly news or the morning paper as harry reviewed the cold statistics of hunger they became even more dramatic he reminded us that hunger is most vicious when it stalks the young that 100 000 children go blind each year because of vitamin deficiencies that in some poorer countries almost half the children die before reaching the age of 5 mostly from nutritionrelated diseases and that among the survivors handicaps of learning behavior and work capacity are widespread due to inadequate diets and recurring illness harry would repeat to himself and to millions of others that these conditions did not have to exist and people listened and they read and they learned that we do have the basic technological knowhow and resources to alleviate the hunger problem it became plain to those who began to familiarize themselvbs with the many dimensions and facets of the hunger problem that our task is formidable indeed but that is where harry came in many of my colleagues will attest to the fact that is was difficult if not impossible to avoid becoming totally enveloped in harrys electric enthusiasm he sparked a realization that the job was not going to get any easier that the time had come to roll up our sleeves to construct a comprehensive strategy against hunger more finely tuning those programs with a demonstrated record of success and terminating those programs which actually exacerbated the hunger problem i first met harry during the summer of 1977 he had come to washington seeking support for an idea he and his wife sandy had conceived creating a presidential commission on world hunger to find ways that our nation could develop more effective policies to combat hunger and malnutrition more comfortable in the jeans and casual shirts and shoes his fans recognized him in harry had come to town in a conservative threepiece suit that lobbying suit as harry liked to call it was to get quite a workout during the next year in between the hundreds of concerts he performedmore than half to benefit the hungerfighting activities of his world hunger year and food policy center organizationshe would return to washington to lobby for his hunger commission singlehandedly harry stormed the capitol along with me harry persuaded our former colleague rick nolan and senators pat leaiiy and bob dole to introduce a resolution urging the president to establish the commission he soon generated enough interest in the conmmission to attract 265 cosponsors in the house and 51 in the senate the presidential commission on world hunger was finally established in 1978 during the course of the next 2 years harry never missed a commission meeting often exhausted after a night of performing at a concert and the logistical nightmare of grabbing any available means of transportation to get back to washington for the commission meeting the next day harry nevertheless injected a spirit of infectious enthusiasm into those meetings he was the conscience of the commission everurging us to explore the deeply rooted causes of hunger and prodding us to produce a final report which did not equivocate did not pull any punches in detailing those actions our nation would have to take if the hunger problem was to be resolved harry chapin led our commissions efforts to involve the public in our deliberations and to explore ways to mobilize public opinion in support of comprehensive policy initiatives against hunger the commissions report did not reflect unanimous support for each of its findings or conclusions with differences of opinion noted in our report but we did provide the chief executive and the american public with some good thoughtful recommendations producing a document which has served as a vehicle to stimulate muchneeded public discussion about the dimensions of and threats posed by world hunger the end of the commission did not end harry chapins commitment to ending hunger it was but a new beginning meeting with him on a number of occasions during this past year harry expressed his everpresent concern that congress and the administration commit itself to developing new hunger policies he continued to pound upon the doors of staid indifference to the global suffering and instability that hunger breeds i always had to listen very carefully when harry spoke because he could pack into 5 minutes more thoughtful innovative ideas than anyone i have known in a conversion he was a master at conceptually changing gears launching a fusillade of incisive questions comments and proposals on a variety of topics it was as if he were afraid he would not have the time to discuss and to do all those things that truly mattered to him there is an empty space now where once there was boundless energy and unfettered contagious enthusiasm calling for an end to world hunger harry once asked and if our future lies on the final line are we brave enough to see the signals and the signs resolving the complicated global problem of hunger will not be an easy task it will be that much more difficult with the absence of a prodding insistent force such as harry chapin but world hunger does place our future on the final line harry took the time to see the signals and the signs of an awesome menacing problem which if left to fester would visit an unprecedented catastrophe on us all he bravely confronted powerful institutional impediments to change and individuals revering the status quo he underscored the urgent need for courageous decisions if our nation were to act against hunger while the best opportunities for success still existed we greatly miss harry chapin our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to his wife sandy and their five children jamie jason jond jenny and josh during this grievous period but those of us who harry touched so deeply who remember the hopefilled strains of his songs who recall his unfailing commitment to others will not let harrys vision and dream be forgotten i urge my colleagues to find in the spirit of harry chapin their own determination to channel the necessary resources and energies of our nation into a long term comprehensive strategy to end world hunger"], [0.9883516011759639, 0.011648398824036121, 1, "i rise in support of the consensus bill i think this can now be termed a bipartisan and noncontroversial bill and i am pleased to join with my colleagues in supporting its passage i first want to commend the members who have worked on this bill i think we have dealt with this bill in a responsible manner we have given our seabed mining companies what they need an interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my remarks in short i believe the bill before us meets the foreign policy and national security interests of this country as well as the interests of the seabed mining industry and i urge the members to vote for the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill from foreign affairs spring 19801"], [0.9881828427314758, 0.9881828427314758, 0, "i am

amendment i am offering would prevent the use of any funds by the departments and agencies funded by this bill for the implementation of any regulations or actions which have been vetoed by congress using the specific veto procedures provided by applicable law there are several programs and agencies funded under this bill which are subject to some sort of legislative veto for example the president is subject to congressional veto for actions taken under the executive reorganization act impoundment control act and war powers act all regulations promulgated by the federal elections commission may be vetoed by congress furthermore under the presidential recordings and materials preservation act the administrator of the general services administration may make regulations concerning public access to tape recordings and congress may veto these rules if it so chooses the basic issue here however transcends the question of legislative veto even the few members who still do not support legislative vetoes surely must support the doctrine of following the law under which legislative vetoes are enacted and then duly exercised i have offered this amendment because past administrations have stated their intentions not to obey the law with regard to legislative vetoes this unfortunate circumstance became concrete under the carter administration last year after congress vetoed four sets of regulations proposed by the department of education in response the carter administration through attorney general benjamin civiletti and secretary shirley hufetedler announced a decision to ignore these vetoes in short the carter administration said it would not obey the law providing for legislative veto of these regulations as it was duly enacted by congress and signed by the president the law in this case is very simple it is very explicit it says that where bota houses of the congress have adopted a congressional veto the regulations become null and void however the problem was not just with the department of education it was the general policy of the carter administration while i would hope that the reagan administration will not be willing to disregard the law we must be sure that the law is followed this amendment will act as a safeguard to prevent this disregard for the law from occurring again the action of past administrations makes the issue one of whether we in congress are going to allow the law to be ignored i do not believe any member of congress can stand by and allow our mandates to be treated in such cavalier fashion the constitution of the united states requires the president of the united states to faithfully execute the laws he is not given the authority to pick and choose those laws he wants to implement and those that he does not want to implement it is not for the executive branch to decide what laws will be enforced there is a very important case that illustrated that point kendall against united states decided by the supreme court in 1838 in that instance the president of the united states directed the postmaster general not to pay a certain sum required to be paid by congress to a contractor with the post office and in issuing the writ of mandamus the court said to contend that the obligation imposed on the president to see the laws faithfully executed implies a power to forbid their execution is a novel construction of the constitution and entirely inadmissible no the president of the united states does not have the power or the right or the prerogative not to enfoice thelaws where such disputes exist the proper forum for resolving them lies within the court system and ultimately within the jurisdiction of the supreme court the administrations questions about this provision of the law should be resolved in that arena not by noncompliance this is a simple proposition once a legislative veto has been exercised it is a disobedience of the law by thosecharged with the responsibility of executing the law to disregard it and i do not think we ought to give them money to disobey the law the only way we can effectively enforce these provisions of the law is to provide a limitation for funding so that no funds can be used for purposes of implementing disapproved or vetoed actions that is the reason i have offered this amendment we are facing a significant challenge to our constitutional powers and we must rise to meet it my amendment will do so in a simple direct fashion i urge every member of this body to support its passage"], [0.0008096694946289062,

states for compensation of the president 250 000 we are not changing the salary of the president am i correct on that"], [0.0009002685546875, 0.5009002685546875, 0, "madam chairman i move to strike the requisite number of words and i rise in opposition to the simon amendment to the hansen amendment madam chairman let me point out that coming from az state legislature perhaps i do not understand the rules here because normally we have to consider what is germane to the issue i respectfully point out that i have great respect for the gentleman from illinois who put in this amendment and i have great respect for the gentleman from missouri and the gentleman from new york i apologize to all the members for not putting my amendment forward earlier than i have because apparently none have gotten the opportunity to read the amendment it has really nothing to do with where the mx is going to be based it has nothing to do with the patriotism of the people is missouri or utah but what i would like to point outand i will get right to the point because i have the greatest respect for the gentleman from illinois is that what happens in his particular amendment is that if the congress is dilatory and does not act within 60 days we lose the whole thing and i do not feel we want to go that way so very frankly if the simon amendment passes as i understand it from the gentleman from illinois then i would be in the position that i would have to vote against my own amendment"], [0.0009085237979888916, 0.4990914762020111, 0, "i rise in support of the deferral disapproval resolutions before you today they total 58 6 million in budget authority for activities452 million of which overturns one item the strategic petroleum reserve this deferral would delay the construction of the big hill tex permanent storage site by 1 year the proposed delay was represented to us by omb as an economy move we could save 52 million in budget authority in fiscal year 1982 by agreeing to it today however witnesses conceded that this delay would cost the taxpayers 625 million in total increased costs 95 million in inflated construction costs and 530 million in extra costs for oil it was obvious that we would be pennywise and poundfoolish to agree to this deferral frankly if you read the papers and watch television you can see the eruption of a new war in the persian gulfit is clear that our oil supplies are not yet stable our nations security is too important to play budget games with the strategic petroleum reserve three of the remaining deferrals apply to the historic preservation of urban parks and recreation programs of the national park service they propose to take program funds provided by congress and convert them into administrative funds one of these deferrals proposes to take 2 8 million in previously appropriated funds from the states and transfer them into administrative expenses the comptroller general has ruled that such action is a violation of the budget and impoundment control act and is illegal the administration disagrees so we must act this way because we believe the funds should by law be made available the remaining deferrals take program funds from the fish and wildlife service and convert them into pay costs they will disrupt land acquisition activities in the bon secour national wildlife refuge as well as construction projects in arizona california and new jersey the committee has specifically requested these funds be used for construction and acquisition and rejects this request outright these actions coming late in the year will have little or no effect on our ability to affect the fiscal year 1982 budget they will keep six congressionally approved programs alive and well and they will save us consider ble money if we go forward with them now i urge your approval i move the previous question on the resolution the previous question was ordered"]]}
