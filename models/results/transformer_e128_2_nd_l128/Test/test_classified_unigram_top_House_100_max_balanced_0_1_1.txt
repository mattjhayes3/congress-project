us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my

a private company to manufacture pesticides the arsenal which has been placed on superfunds national priority list is considered one of the most toxic parcels of land in the world it is the no 1 cleanup priority for the department of defense environmental restoration program several toxic disposal basins are located on rma the 96acre basin f was used to dispose of chemical warfare agents and

action we must act resolutely to reassure them of the integrity of their government we must also act expeditiously to avoid paralysis of government and to ensure that america remains strong in its relations with foreign countries accordingly i strongly supported the preliminary investigations done by the foreign affairs and intelligence committees and i applauded appointment of an independent counsel i fully support the need for the house iran committee investigation the interests of the nation lie in getting all the facts of the iran initiative quickly getting them out to the american people and taking corrective action the interests of the nation also lie in protecting our national security secrets in my view this resolution comes up short on both points the resolution requires the iran committee to report to the house by halloween thats too long to wait various committees of the house have already done much of the basic spade work in the investigation which enables the iran committee to complete its work expeditiously it should be required to make every effort to complete its work by april 15 if developments so required it could ask the house for more time there is no justification for the holdup this is an investigation of arms sales to iran and diversion of related fundsthis is not an investigation of the past 6 years of the reagan administration we should finish by april not drag on until october can you imagine what the reaction of this house would have been if the president had said were looking into the matter but we wont let the american people know until october the resolution also defines an outlandishly broad scope for the investigation the issue facing the country is the iran initiative including arms sales and the disposition of the money generated by those sales if the majority wants a general review of the administrations support for freedom fighters around the world under the reagan doctrine or the activities of friendly countries the standing committees of the house are the appropriate forums the iran select committee should focus quickly and effectively upon the matters at issue which concern the american peoplethe iran initiative iran arms sales and what happened to the money paid for the arms moreover it approaches an abuse of congressional power to authorize the iran committee to look into the tax returns of americans all the way back to 1980 the resolution also sets a poor example for spending taxpayers money the resolution provides for openended spending the house at least ought to set an initial budget ceiling for the committee if events so required the committee could seek more money from the house later the most grave concern is that the resolution fails to provide the necessary protection for national security secrets the resolution grants the committee a right of access to such secrets as communications intercepts intelligence funds transactions and national security council proceedings the committee may need access to relevant parts of such material to do its job but the resolutior should mandate the protection for such secrets equivalent to that required for the intelligence committee the resolution should also provide that no committee member or employee of the house can disclose publicly any classified information possessed by the iran committee without the committees approval the committee should not give such approval until it first gives notice to the president with an opportunity for him to explain the effect of the proposed disclosure on the national security if the president objects that the disclosure would damage national security then the information should not be disclosed unless the house votes to approve such disclosure the nation cannot afford

the congress and the president share a responsibility to investigate this matter both thoroughly and expeditiously the president is doing his part with his efforts to get the truth out and make all

james fletcher the administrator of nasa the general accounting office which had done a study of the issue of development of such a second source and officials of several rocket motor manufacturers

number of motors necessary in the case of solid rocket motors the same company has supplied motors for the space shuttle since 1973 when the original contract was awarded since then there have been

objection states that the bill authorizes 40 7 million more in fiscal year 1988 than was requested actually the committee recommends an increase of 11 9 million above the request as follows there is plus 2 3 million for landsat 4 and 5 and advanced system studies both landsat 4 and 5 are operating beyond their designed lifetime but continue to provide data to users through eosat the additional 23 million provided by the committee in fiscal year 1988 will assure continued operation of the system through the fiscal year as well as provide additional funds to begin development of a muchneeded advanced technology civil earth remote sensing satellite there is plus 6 7 million for severe storm research these additional funds maintain this important research at the fiscal year 1987 level aimed

observations forecasts warnings and advisories and issuing of warnings of low temperatures that are especially important in citrusfruitgrowing areas these are services central to the mission of the

consolidation automation or relocation of any weather service office this provision does not in any way hinder the secretary from taking such actions but only that congress be notified in advance it should be noted that the national weather service has proposed to close 7 offices and reduced staffing in 21 other offices in each of the last 3 years without success because of congressional actions

groups such as the sierra club and the american civil liberties union use direct mail as a means of communicating with their members and also as a means of raising funds in reporting h r 4478 the committee does not impugn the direct mail industry however some organizations businesses and individuals use solicitations and promotional practices that are extremely misleading and deceptive these entities through the use of direct mail give the false impression that they represent the federal government or that they offer services endorsed by the government this has resulted in consumers paying for products and services which are not needed or which the government can provide free it is apparent to me and many of my colleagues including mr donnelly and ms snowe that existing statutes are inadequate to protect the public from deceptive mailing practices which have proliferated over the past few years there have been some concerns raised by businesses which market zip code directories tax forms and other government forms for professionals through direct mail we certainly do not mean to penalize legitimate businesses which do provide an enhanced product to a knowledgeable consumer these consumers are generally law firms accounting firms and the medical professionals and would not be groups susceptible to fraudulent misrepresentation we would hope that as this bill proceeds we can find a solution to these concerns without opening the door to abuse the majority of these mailings target our nations elderly focusing on medicare or social security benefits the most important issues to senior citizens the issues of health care and economic security for senior citizens are among the most complex aspects of the federal governments social programs these solicitations are particularly disturbing because unlike other forms of solicitations they instill fear by falsely implying that important and vital federal programs are in danger not all deceptive mailings are targeted toward senior citizens during congressional hearings it became evident that organizations also offered assistanceforafee schemes targeted at other groups companies have offered to obtain a social security number for a persons newborn child for a fee of 10 of course any individual can obtain a social security number for his or her child at no cost a ugust 8 1 988 h r 4478 requires that a disclaimer be put on the face of the envelope containing certain solicitations this provision will make it perfectly clear to an individual receiving and reading a solicitation that it is not an official mailing this disclaimer requirement will also assist the postal service in its enforcement of this law currently it is difficult for the postal service to make a judgment on the content of a mailing based solely on a suspicion that it may be fraudulent or deceptive the unitedstates postal service cannot open mail based on a suspicion that it may be fraudulent or deceptive this bill also requires that a disclaimer be put on the face of the mailing which simply states that this is a solicitation of donations and not a bill invoice or statement of accounts due you are under no obligations to make any payment in response to this mailing this legislation is necessary i believe that it will provide an important safeguard to the general public and will dissuade companies from deceptive mailing practices i urge all members to support this legislation and i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00048404932022094727, 0.500484049320221, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume and i rise in support of s 1822 this legislation represents a compromise between both bodies on sentencing reform amendments as the subcommittee chairman explained the house passed the criminal fine improvements act on october 27 on october 30 the senate responded by adding an additional title to the housepassed bill which contained numerous amendments to the sentencing reform act of 1984 subsequent to that negotiations ensued involving all the interested parties in the congress along with the department of justice the unitedstates sentencing commission and the judicial conference of the united states what we are doing today is unraveling a somewhat complex parliamentary situation by passing two separate pieces of legislation that have been agreed to by all of the interested parties in s 1822 we are considering separately the amendments made in the area of sentencing and agreeing to a copromise which has been developed by members of the house and the senate and endorsed by the department of justice in considering h r 3483 we are agreeing to the compromise worked out by these same parties concerning the criminal fines aspects which are essentially the same as the bill the house passed on october 27 one significant sentencing amendment is in section 3 it deals with the standard which controls a trial judges ability to depart from the new sentencing guidelines when he finds present an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that was not adequately taken into consideration by the commission in formulating those guidelines a few words of explanation are helpful the amendment contained in section 3 of s 1822 is in essence a clarification of the existing standard as the chairman has stated it is not meant to make departure from the guidelines easier than it ought to be but only to assist the sentencing judge when he finds a circumstance be it mitigating or aggravating which is present to a degree not adequately taken into account by the guidelines also the bill in section 2 would solve one of the major constitutional questions raised in connection with the guidelinesthe ex post facto problemby amending the 1984 law so as to make it clear that the new guidelines will apply only to criminal conduct occurring after the guidelines are in effect another important amendment to the sentencing reform act contained in the bill would give the sentencing commission the power to promulgate socalled emergency guidelines when one of its previously promulgated guidelines has been invalidated or a new federal offense has been created or an existing one is amended this emergency power would expire november 1 1989 thus giving the congress an opportunity to examine how well the commission has used this authority the bill would furthermore give the commission a onetime authority for any other reason until may 1 1988 to promulgate urgent and compelling guideline amendments this latter catchall authority is meant to facilitate the operation of the first set of guidelines which nearly everyone recognizes will need quick technical and in some cases substantive amendments in order to succeed in recognition that the first year of guidelines operation will be hectic section 23 postpones for an additional year a requirement that the sentencing commission report to congress its recommendations on grading and penalities for federal offenses under current law the commission has only 1 year to compile such a report this legislation represents action that will help not only to make recently effective sentencing guidelines work but also to continue important improv ements made by the criminal fine enforcement act of 1984 i urge its adoption"], [0.0005789101123809814, 0.499421089887619, 0, "i rise in opposition to the st germain amendment the point was made by the gentleman from north carolina best when he said less money and more oversight or more money and less oversight quite frankly we have seen what i believe are some scare tactics relating to this issue i bet many members of this house believe that if we adopt a 5 billion plan that it is nothing more than a taxpayer finance plan because almost every argument provided here says that if we do not adopt the 15 billion plan the taxpayers are going to be responsible chairman st germain and i had an exchange in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs in which he told me that there is no assurance that the taxpayer will in fact be responsible if the 5 billon were to pass many people have said that the large and solvent savings and loans are the only ones concerned about this what leads us to believe that they do not care about their depositors why should we risk the solvency of the healthy institutions they supporta 5 billion recapitalization and if there are still problems we can revisit the issue in 2 years i urge a no vote on the st germain amendment"], [0.0005898773670196533, 0.49941012263298035, 1, "i rise with my colleagues today to express my solidarity with yuli kosharovsky a hebrew teacher in moscow who has sought to emigrate from the soviet union for 17 years in washington jerusalem london and moscow people are commemorating yulis anniversary today so that international attention does not stray from the hundreds of thousands of jews who remain in the soviet union against their will yuli kosharovsky is our focus today but there are an estimated 50 000 refuseniks with him in the soviet union including almost 2 000 who have wanted to emigrate since 1977 this is a particularly important time to speak out on behalf of soviet jews in january of this year soviet officials announced a new immigration policy applicants must now have an invitation from firstdegree relatives abroad before their papers will even be considered this means that the 90 percent of the jewish population without immediate family members who were lucky enough to leave in the past are denied the right even to apply to leave today applicants now also bear the additional burden of producing parental approvals as well as affidavits from all soviet family members releasing them from any financial claims finally the new regulation reiterates longstanding soviet policy that applicants will be turned down if they have had access to state secrets as we have seen access is extremely loosely defined to include many government jobs even if applicants held them a decade or two ago although there is nothing new in these conditions their reemer gence amounts to a cynical rebuke to thousands of refuseniks in what is supposed to be an era of openness and reform worst of all the regulations deny many jews the basic right to apply for emigration to be sure there was some glasnost for soviet jews last year and there appeared to be great reason for optimism in 1988 over 8 000 refuseniks left the soviet union in 1987 an enormous jump from recent years perhaps most significantly several refusenii leaders including yosef begun natan scharansky and ida nudel emigrated after years and years of struggle in 1986 and 1987 glasnost was also felt in the area of arms control economic reforms and international relations already in 1988 however fewer jews have received permission to leave while more than 800 refuseniks obtained exit visas in november and december only 720 and 730 left the country in january and february respectively i sincerely hope that 1987 was not merely a year of good public relations by soviet officials on the question of jewish emigration but the regulations of 1988 look terribly harsh turning back much of the success and promise of the previous year 1988 will be a challenging year for mikhail gorbachev and his efforts to reform the soviet system the general secretary is already facing numerous nationality protests in armenia and azerbaijhan i stand with my colleagues to urge the soviet union to get rid of another nagging problem revoke the january emigration regulations forgot the worn out state secrets excuse and raise the level of jewish emigration beyond that of 1987 we in the united states congress will not rest on this issue until we are

and utilization program is in jeopardy of falling into an unproductive state due to significant cuts in the house appropriation nasas project pathfinder is a research and development program that will develop the technologies required to enable the further utilization of space in the balance of this century and beyond in the past space exploration and utilization have indirectly benefited segments of our society and our economy far beyond the immediate researchers as in all good scientific endeavors if we do not move positively forward in this area we risk stagnation and loss of initiative preserving the status quo is insufficient project pathfinder will enable us to move positively forward in areas required for exploration of the moon mars and the solar system in particular it will enable advances in remote exploration power communications and perhaps most importantly the technologies required for successful and productive prolonged human missions in space in particular the space power program at los alamos national laboratory in my district is essential if we are to have any missions manned or unmanned to the outer planets where solar power is insufficient remote power systems are also essential for missions near the sun where solar panels burn up and even on the moon where there is a 12earthdaylong night if we dont properly support these technologies now then they will not be ready when we need them in fact such technologies as space nuclear power may disappear altogether and either have to be imported or reinvented when the time comes that we really need it
