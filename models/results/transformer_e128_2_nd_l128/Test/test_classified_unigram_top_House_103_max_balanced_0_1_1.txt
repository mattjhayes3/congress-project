have always beleved that thi investigation was not necessary we were told by th majority tvhi there were trowbing llegations those allgatons were not troubling there were preposterous both newsweek and the new republic concluded as much in detailed investigative reports before the democrats even started this committee there is a curious aliceinwondarend logic about all of this first there were a number of october surprise conspiracy theories reported in the media these theories fed off each other repealing the same myths and fentasles in different ways taking unproven assertions and claiming they were undeniable facts quoting dubious sources playing up anything that could damage the reagan campaign team playing down anything that would damage their own case al the sordid ancient ticks of the conspiracy trade but simply by being reported and commented upon in the politcay correct media outlets ihat is the new york tames public television et cetera the conspiracy theories were said by democrats to raihe questions that needed to be answered once that claim was made it was inevitable that a congress dominated by democrats would be asked to provide the answers particularly since it was the antirepublican conspiracy theorists themselves who primarily did the asdng so the house had a costy investigaton based on nothing more than the claim that questions had been raised but questions are raised all the time in the media theories about secret powerful cabals of sinister puppet masters abound why was this particular theory dragged out for so long in the press paid such respectful attention and finally made the subject of two congressional investigations the fact that the questions were raised by disgruntled democratic party partisans shady characters and worldclass international liars was rarely mentioned by democrats when democrats were accused by republicans of partisanship in asking for an investigation based on unproven allegations they held up their hands in pious horror and exclaimed but questions have been raised we must investigate as if they rush to answer all conspiracy theory questions as matter of principle shorn of its sensationalism here is what happened reaganhating political activists and scoundrels concocted a libelous story claiming that ronald reagan or his aides or both deliberately used the hostages for their own political purposes the media reported the story and gave the theorists forums from which to spread the ibel because the story had been reported democrats said there are questions that must be answered and a congressional investigatory committee was formed and funded the theories were as i have said groundless is this going to be the investigative model for our future in the house will the democratic leadership always call for an investigation of conspiracy theories no manner what the source so long as questions are raised will we see democrats rushing to the floor or secretly enlisting the gao to investigate conspiracy theories about president clinton if and when such theories appear if some disgruntled republican who served in the bush administration manages to get a large part of the oped page given to him of the new york times as mr sick dkto offer a wacko conspiracy theory about the president clinton will democrats say questions have been ralsedl and call for an investigation i watch and wait with patient expectation it is also interesting to note the timing of the release of the report i can guarantee you one thing if there had been one bit of evidence that the reaganbush campaign was indeed involved the information would have been on every front page across the nation before the election instead the report concluded that there was no credible evidence of a conspiracy and it was released following the election i commend mr hamilton the very distinguished member from indiana who did a fine job in leading this investigation but lee hamilton should not be forced to

that out to a cost that we feel is fairly reliable of 3 billion a year paid in california for social services and justice costs and other costs for illegal aliens we have had now an increase of 1 000 percent of chinese illegal aliens coming across the land border between mexico and the united states over just the last 4 months of the year that is over 500 chinese illegal aliens have been arrested coming across the land border lastly and perhaps most critical we have done an experiment in which we took illegal aliens who had been convicted of major crimes after they did their time in the united states we sent them in deep repatriation to mexico city so far 34 of those 300 criminal aliens have been recaptured coming back across the border between the united states and mexico if you consider that at any given time our border patrol is so small that we only have about 50 to 60 agents on the entire californiamexico border and if you consider the fact that in excess of 5 illegal aliens come through for every 1 that is captured that means that roughly half of these criminal aliens have already made their way back into the united states there are many reasons with our very liberal

responsibility to anybody but one thing for sure not to be accountable either to congress or the president the federal open market committee open market does not mean it is an open committee it is closed doors absolutely strict secrecy of course it has the allpowerful determination of what your standard of living is or is goingto be or is currently being determined and has been for some couple

think as some citizens have written very learned and experienced corporate heads who themselves have been involved in very very effective and iongreaching financial transactions both nationally and internationally and they keep calling and writing and saying but we always assumed that the congress would be there and would not have relinquished its total oversight jurisdiction and vested this socalled board with such powers for many many years past and more recently on several repeated occasions i have given my colleagues the intricacies of what is the federal reserve board it is not a government body it is a creature of the private commercial banking system i have gone into that before so i will not repeat it it simply amazes me how many of my colleagues and how many citizens of

affairs since i came to the congress 321 2 years ago up ur just relatively recently no more than 8 years every federal reserve board chairman that would appear before the committee would say that they had nothing to do with controlling interest rates that those things were the result of and they consistently repeated it the profligacy o congress and the market socalled now they not only admit it they brag about it the truth of the matter is as i have pointed out in a brief hearing before the committee to the immediate predecessor chairman of the federal reserve board paul volkmer i asked him isnt it a fact that today we no longer can control those forces that are now external to our shore that actually no matter what we do domestically will determine such things as interest rates 1210 and he acceded to the point so even though they boast today openly all those years they refused to accept that responsibility but they can determine the fateof an administration by simply determining what it is they will pay that is the bankers because the federal reserve board is private it is acorporation the congress does not have any stock in it the president does not have any stock in it the stock is owned by the commercial banks and the members of the federal reserve board system they can determine the price of treasuries and thereby in effect have such rippling effects as interest rates and determine the fate of an administration actually this has happened it happened in 1972 it happened again in 1980 when the prime interest rate went to the incredible rate of 21 percent all history as i have said repeatedly shows that thereis not one society that has survived usury se may 16 1994 and if 21 percent prime interest rate is not usury or an extortionate interest rate then i do not know what the defi1 nition of usury is this forceful buy mysterious body known as the federal open market committee recently established a formal trilateral facility with two foreign governments that

trilateral setup and what is wrong is the funds have never been appropriated nor authorized by the unitedstates congress this is where so many of these corporate heads just in the last 10 days have communicated their shock they were not award of that how many of my colleagues think that there are interest rate controls or usury laws on the national level we have not had any since the national currency act of 1865 which incidentally was foremost in abraham lin colns mind when he was shot he knew what was coming but can my colleagues imagine any of my predecessors at the beginning of my career the chairman then thinking that interest rates would even reach prime interest rates over 7 percent much less 20 percent and 21 percent why they would have and i am sure they have turned over in their grave 50 times but not today the truth of the matter is my colleagues as optimistic as i am inher ently i think the time is long gone where through the ordinary course of events the congress is going to regain power power as frederick douglass said never yields except on demand it never has and it never will do we think these vast financial and banking and corporate oligarchs and plutocrats are going to yield this tremendous power of determining the fate of the fi nancial and economic wellbeing of a whole country why of course not we can forget about it not willingly is the congress going to rise i hope i always pray five of the members of this federal open market committee who discussed and voted to authorize these lines of credit and permanent loan facilities to foreign countries have never been confirmed by the senate and therefore are not constitutional officers even if by strict legal defini tion such were the case they were selected by the directors of the federal reserve banks twothirds of whom are elected by private commercial bankers and there is and always hasbeen serious doubt about the feds unilateral claim to the power to make these deals i have voiced that since we first heard of such things as swaps on april 26 the federal reserve joined with the treasury department to es tablish a permanent trilateral foreign exchange what they will call swap fa cility with the governments of mexico and canada this international loan facility should be of the utmost importance to unitedstates taxpayers whose taxes have been and continue to be placed at risk by these foreign exchange interventions foreign loans and lines of credit to foreign countries who determines what country these gentlemen who account to nobody except their own interest it is important to understand just what this recent 6 billion swap facility for mexico entails for which the fed pledges of that amount the feds part even through they announced their 6 billion guarantee several weeks ago they have actually under this agreement pledged 3 billion to benefit mexico however if the mexican government wanted 6 billion in united states currency tomorrow and went into the market to buy united states dollars with pesos the price of pesos would fall and it is unlikely they could make the trade at current exchange rates a guarantee of the transfer at any time at current exchange rates is a guarantee of a substantial subsidy to the mexican government when activated the 6 billion swap formally transfers this subsidy to mexico a week ago i brought on my colleagues now here it is this use i say illegal and unconstitutional of taxpayers money could be so easily found in the range of billions yet just 3 years ago that great historic state of rhode island was facing bankruptcy and the banks were closed and the credit unions were closed and the savings and loans were closed and we had a hearing in may of 1991 and we had a thousand of these rhode islanders elderly there had been an increase of almost 50 percent in the relief rolls because most of the elderly had their pension resources which is what was keeping them tied up the great sovereign state of rhode island only needed a line of credit so that it could issue bonds i tried to get the fed and they have the power to do it did they do it why they would not even discuss it i tried to get the other entities the fdic and the like and not a word so we had to come back and on june 28 in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs to the glory of each member we passed out a line of credit guarantee program so that rhode island could pledge its revenues from the sales tax to guarantee the issuance of the bonds and pay back or never have to use that guarantee from the government but we had to doit when it did not require legislation it could have ibeen doneby these same powerful oligarchic entitles that find it easy to provide billions for foreign governments but not for one of our own sovereign states my colleagues i think that is not only shameful i think it is criminal and it is a direct challenge to use who have been electedby the people to tepresent their interest not the bankers but their interest for us not to rise as one and protest and correct and reform and handle it in the way the constitution says it should be done in truth the socalled guarantee is a loan of united states dollars to mexico collateralized by pesos there is no denying thatgiving unitedstates dollars to a foreign government with conditions for repayment is simply a loan for unitedstates dollars in a may 9 1994 letter i received from the federal reserve chairman alan greenspan he asserted there is no exchangerate risk since the loan is scheduled to be repaid at the initial exchange rate and interest can be earned on foreign currencies held however default risk the probability of failure to repay is not eliminated a guarantee of a line of credit such as the 3 billion rate now available to mexico places united states taxpayers funds at risk in the event of default that is why i am asking the federal reserve to provide full details of all its foreigncurrency operations including completed federal open market committee transcripts where these important international currency arrangements are discussed these transcripts have not been available in fact when we had that historic meeting last october and had all the presidents and governors they attempted to deceive the committee and thereby the congress and we discovered that they had been keeping these transcripts but do they want to make them available to the representatives of the people absolutely not and that is something that i have discussed at great length before so i will not extend it now one of the most important objectives of the legislation i have introduced known as h r 28 the federal reserve system accountability act of 1993 is to increase the federal reserves accountability to the public knowing how individual members of the fomc decide on different issues serves to improve the public trust and enhances the ability of the federal reserve to carry out appropriate monetary policy i congratulate chairman greenspan and his colleagues on the federal open market committee for taking the important step of properly releasing recent monetary policy decisions just recently and again under pressure now if the fed would only take the next step of making complete transcripts of its eighth annual fomc meetings promptly available to the public people can know when and why the federal reserve is using taxpayers money for foreignexchange intervention foreign loans and lines of credit to foreign countries at least that much we will be able to hear the discussion why what were the reasons what were the members who had different ideas and how many of them spoke up i think that is important for us to know not that it changes the basic responsibility of this power to lend falling within the constitutional mandated authorization and appropriation processes now my colleagues you may not realize this but the congress never gave the federal reserve approval to establish what has today become a 30 billion swap fund this amount that the fed has amounts to 30 1 billion why that amount of money would take care of all of our housing programs that we have not been able to fund and appropriate for just that amount but this is their reserve for foreign countries which ones depends we do not know expect now and then like when they released the 6 billion arrangement with mexico or at least the line ofcredit chairman greenspans response to my letter on may 9 raises even further doubts about the legality of the federal reserves use of these appropriated funds that are used to make loans to foreign governments and to extend to them lines of credit the federal reserves periodic forays into foreign policy by way of its swap fund is certainly an issue that should be of immense concern to the congress the federal reserve began its foreigncurrency operations in 1962 and ever since then now 1962 was president kennedy and i was abroad here and i raised my voice then of course i was relatively a freshman and you certainly were supposed to be seen and not heard even at that time but i always have spoken out this was done without congressional authorization william mcchesney martin who was the chairman of the federal reserve at that time did not want to formally ask the congress for authorization because he said the federal reserve did not know what it needed and i am going to quote the congress probably would not want to put itself in the position of approving something if the federal reserve was not clear about its wishes in the matter that is reflected in the minutes of the fomc the federal open market committee of february 13 1992 chairman martin notified the congress of the federal reserves intention to establish the swap fund but he did this not openly but by burying it in a ninepage speech he gave january 30 1962 to the joint economic committee he mentioned in his testimony that the federal reserve bank of new york acting as an agent for the treasury had used the treasurys exchange stabilization fund the fund on which the federal reserves swap fund is based for operations not previously undertaken since world war ii with the aim of defending the dollar from speculative forays i think i was the only one in the congress that mentioned that there was such a thing as speculation but in 1962 in the 1960s in fact who much thought that that big tide after the war period of wellbeing would ever end and that america was the richest country in the world and the only one even then we were unaffected with that virus and nobody paid much attention it was certainly no concern but there were two things that happened that were clear signals right after 1960 the trade account for the first time showed a deficit of 10 billion i spoke out and said the reason for that was simple there were tremendous watershed periods of change since 1950 and i gave some statistics then i said in 1950 the late 1940s and 1950 the united states truly was producing almost 80 percent of the worlds needs but by 1960 it was not even 40 percent and today it is not even 19 percent so naturally sooner or later i said then things are going to have to happen for us to foresee plan ahead and see how we can anticipate these forces that willeventually turn us around also the emergence in the 1960s of the megacorporate international or translational institutions i spoke out on the record it is not what i am saying now of course at that time nobody used special orders on the floor you could write them out submit them for the record and they would be printed as if you had uttered them i never thought that was the intent of what got to be called specials orders but which is not the technical word for it i came to the floor made the speech and it is in the record i pointed out that the united states by necessity since there were nations arising in europe and asia that would soon supplant and compete with the united statesbut that is history but i am giving you this part of the history as to the genesis or the beginning of this socalled swap now it is interesting but at that time the chairman of the federal reserve board realized what the law says why that first chapter of the first section of the federal reserve act of 1913 says the federal reserve shall be the fiscal agent of the unitedstates treasury now at that time and until again the 1960s in fact president kennedy during his brief but inspiring period restored and therefore you could in 1961 1962 1963 you could dig into your pockets and if you took out five 1 notes the chances are at least two of those were unitedstates treasury notes today you look at your 1 bill 5 s10 20 and it says federal reserve notes meaning the federal reserve is the one that is printing our money that is the commercial bankers not the unitedstates government so 16 and behold as the law says the federal reserve shall be the fiscal agent of the treasury and it is now the treasurys fiscal agent or just agent or the handmaiden of the federal reserve board but it is interesting that in 1962 chairman martin said well we are going to act as the agent for treasury which has the socalled stabilization of swap fund at that time thencongressman richard bolling of missouri asked chairman martin to explain what because congressman bolling was on the joint economic committee chairman martin replied this way and i quote i want to make clear mr bolling that the federal reserve is not anxious to engage in this type of activity the treasury stabilization fund has experimented with this kind of operation since march of this year in a very small way and we have come to the view that however we should require these currencies and it is not possible to spell out here what we are aiming at is to keep the speculators from unseating us that was the joint economic hearing of 1962 pages 181 and 182 chairman greenspan has attached to his may 9 1994 letters a document prepared by the federal reserve general counsel who at that time was howard hackley this document dated november 2 1962 is entitled legal aspects of proposed plan for federal reserve operations and federal currencies it states with respect to the federal reserves proposed swap fund and i am going to quote this matter is admittedly subject to a question and while it is unlikely that the plan would be challenged in court there can be no assurance in the absence of legislation and i repeat in the absence of legislation that it would not be criticized from some sources on legal grounds the general counsel goes on to say consultation with banking and currency committees admittedly the question is debatable particularly in view of the 19331934 position of the board moreover it may be noted that in 1932 senator carter glass had criticized certain foreign operations of the federal reserve bank of new york which might be considered similar to those now contemplated as being contrary to law senator glass suggested that such operations were inconsistent with the federal reserve act and i say certainly with respect to the constitution the general counsel of the federal reserve said in view of the uncertainties as to the construction of the law and the history of this matter it might be desirable before instituting the plan now proposed to inform the banking and currency committees of the congress so the fed notified congress well in a speech as i said earlier as i have noted chairman martin tried his best to play down the feds plan to establish a swap fund when he testified before the congress the extent of the feds obfuscation is illustrated by the fact that the fed never asked the congress for enabling legislation why not the idea was to go ahead with as little fuss as possible which is always the argument given to us act quick fast i have always said that fast government can be dangerous government if congress did not pick up on the importance of the deal so much the better for in the feds eyes silence would amount to consent and the idea was not to wake any sleeping watchdogs there was not unanimity though at the federal reserve for that decision to establish a swap fund during the 1962 federal reserve meetings one of the federal reserve board governors j l robertson expressed concern about the proposed establishment of this fund chairman greenspan has been trying to play down the extent of governor robertsons concerns in his may 9th letter to me chairman greenspan depicts the dissent at the february 13 1962 fomc meetings as the expression of mere reservation i disagree with that interpretation during that meeting governor robertson asked if there were anyadvantages aside from the federal reserves unlimited pocketbookand by the way that reminds me at the time in 1984 that the continental illinols bank went under and incidentally the congress and our committee unfortunately never did go into that to establish the underlying cause it was a harbinger of the crisis that still continues to confront us in the financial and with reference to my concern the insured depository institutions why because those are the ones that the taxpayers guarantee stands behind but in 1984 the continental illinois went under and it took as i found out later 6 billion of the fedand that is taxpayers moneyto shore things up now the reasons why that crisis were first underlying causesand then immediate causesthe immediate cause was that the continental illinois had changed from its old conservative i would not use the word conservative but frugal and prudent methods and went into competition with the new york international banks thinking that they were going to be no 1 in effect the year before it went under it was rated the no 1 bank and when it did so it exposed itself as our whole country is exposed today the treasury which just until recently the japanese owned twothirds of our treasury of our debt and in direct acquisition of assets and indirect acquisition of assets we hear a lot about the japanese but great britain has 2h times more than the japanese and that is inclusive of banking in fact in california the japanese banking interests own over 25 percent this is the reason why i had the only hearings any committee really had on pertinent sections of the socalled nafta agreement the ones that we held three three hearings we were totally blanked out by the press they did not report it did not cover it and did not want to go into it but it was very disturbing and in those hearings we brought out more than several things and that was that the socalled free trade agreement had very little to do with trade over 90 percent of it is the power that the big banks in our countrythat was the locomotive it was chapter 14 information which we had the hearings entitled banking and finance to the port of nafta the big banks where mexico has an exposure of over 80 billion it has not even been able to pay the interest it has had to roll over the interest these banks thought boy we get nafta pushed through and when it is in place mexico will be able to pay us 10 billion a year well it is illusory why because in opening it up for the american banks and it will be a few it also for the first time is now apparent that in the united states we have subsidiaries of foreign banks as we brought out that still needs a congress to act our committee is still acting on bnl bcci because it shows a vulnerability to these foreign monies and activities of our system and believe it or not nafta is supposed to be a regionalmaybe western hemisphere so we will have after gatt which will be known as a world trade organization after a whilewill give the asia japanese et cetera block the european community block and of course the united states western hemisphere but japan has been coming in as well as france and other countries in latin america like they did before world war ii so nafta is supposed to ensure the hegemony of banking and financial activity but lo and behold i have news for my colleagues since you did it in secrecy the congress for the first time conceded and delegated what i consider to be nondelegable constitutional power wait and see time will tell but in the meanwhile the japanese banks through their subsidiaries in the united states have found a way to get into mexico that my friends is what we were trying to bring out in order to have a full evaluation of this agreement that was reached in total secrecy who wrote that agreement nafta can any of my colleagues mention the participants i say no you cant we brought that out in one of those three hearings but also going back to 1984 this is the hubris this is the spirit of power total incontrovertible and unquestioning power that these folks demand and get from the fed and have gotten after that we had a brief hearing after continental went under it went under because immediately a little shopping mall bank in oklahoma had a get an up and go 28yearold and he came to continental and was able to evade the timehonored limitation in banking where no one bank can lend morethan 15 percent with resources to any one borrower well this old smart boy whiz kid he was able to come to different iayers of the continental illinois and far exceed that then when the oil depression hit he could not pay continental began to suffer some questions the word went out into the foreign press and soon the japanese and the german inyestors pulled out 8 3 billion in 3 days boom went the bank fed came in with 6 billion so when mr chairman volcker came before us i asked him one question well you say that the reason you did that is because youre not going to suffer because of the ripple effect any large bank could go under now suppose you have two or three more of these he said i dont care i will use every resource of this country to save them i say now isnt that wonderful to have that tremendous unheard of unprecedented in the annals of human history power to have these private banketeers through bad judgment bad banking be able to be shored up by the taxpayer and saved from their folly and then there was born this socalled toobigtofail doctrine i could not persuade the chairman at that time to have followup hearings and challenge that power absolutely not so i must say by way of parenthesis that when governor robertson asked if there were any advantages aside from the federal reserves unlimited pocketbook and this is what paul volcker had in mind i will use every resource this country owns every resource for what to save the privileged bankers from their folly i ask wouldnt it be nice if other businessmen who lost out because of something they couldnt control in the market could have the same provision keep them in business even though they failed governor robertson opposed the federal reserves entry into the operation partly on legal grounds his objections were very strong as revealed in the minutes not like chairman greenspan is trying to pawn them over now at the february 13 1962 board of governors meeting he voted against amending regulation and to authorize the federal reserve to conduct a planned foreign exchange operation only after that authority was passed giving away the boys authority to the fomc did he join with the majority later in the day at the fomc meeting his opposition was indeed much more telling than having mere reservations and should be reviewed by present fomc members and others interested in the way the original swap facility came into existence chairman greenspan sent the committee on banking finance and urban affairs a list of 60 institutions which the federal reserve bank of new york transacted foreign exchange business for unitedstates monetary authorities since 1989 i would like to know how these institutions are selected and whatsafeguards are in place to prevent the release of exploitable inside information about foreign currency operations which incidentally is one of the biggest worldwide gambling casinos in operation on the socalled futures on international currency worth and transactions andi have spoken out on that before so iwill not repeat it today but i want to know how these institutions are selected at 60 since 1989 is this information insiders could learn about and then make a profit from as happened in the other section where the federal reserve has this privileged select group in the case of these security bankers buying treasury bills and where we had the big steel buy the big firm out of new york less than 2 years ago what happened after that did they ever pay that money about 2 billion the treasury lost on that gambling no they did not they were fined about 200 million with this a distinct possibility can we be confident that the fed is really df nding the store after all we have already seen how bond traders could and did abuse their privileged position in what i just referred to the treasury bond market the legislation i have introduced the federal reserve system accountability act of 1993 significantly increases congressional oversight of the fed without tampering with any of its independence in such things as determined monetary policy not at all in fact even a distinguished member of the committee the ranking minority members says whether he agrees or not that my position is relatively mild that there is nothing radical about it of course it is not unless we are willing now to say that if you stand up to have accountability to the people who elected us i say to my colleagues is being radical unless we are ready to say that we will unconstitutionally delegate the nondelegable power mandated only by the constitution as the power to declare war the power to coin our money and the power to determine the value thereof that is vested only in the congress and there were good reasons for that but until we address this question the congress has abdicated its power anyone who believes in an open ac countable government should and j hope will join me in finding these fed imposed restrictions an outrage i have asked and i have pleaded with my colleagues to join me in this effort the american people have every right tr complete accountability of course there have always been two schools of thought throughout mankinds experience with governmentthose who believe that unless there was a select group chosen because of superior ability to tell the people what was good for them why no good would come of it and you would not have law and order then you have the other school of thought that says no that maybe in the short run people will make mistakes but in the long run the people are the better judges as to what is good or best for them and that has been at the core of the american idea of government but we are now insuring ourselves to the european continental concept of accepting their idea with contentment in the midst of poverty and abdicating our ability to govern ourselves to some of these exclusively selected higher beings the bankers to tell us how they are going to struggle in our behalf and in secret they are so proud of this that they do it all in secret no i say the time is upon us it is later than we think i say to my colleagues and i ask them to join me in this legislation there are these powerful banking lobbyists who have written it off for this congress but i am going to try and will keep on trying as long as i am digcharging this responsibility even as i have had the responsibility before i still have this responsibility the bill also requires the general accounting office the only arm we ha0 in congress to oversee the executive branch to scrutinize certain federal reserve operations including those of the swap fund the fed lobbied congress in 1978 so that the gaq would not be allowed to investigate a swap we came very close in 1978 but not quite and the federal reserve through its bank members and lobbyists really worked it over anyone who believes in an open and accountable governmentwill join me i repeat in protesting and correcting these injustices i hope that i can elicit the support necessary on h r 28 i have a fairly good number of members of the committee but we are going to have to have a definite majority to get it out of committee this socalled central bank known as the fed should no longer have the ability to arrogate to itself new powersandkeep all of us in the dark about its policies and processes all we seek is just plain sinple honest accountability mr

efforts from the beginning they have cooperated with the public works and transportation committee the houses authorizing committee for corps water resources programs i especially want to thank members of the house appropriations committee they have worked closely with me and others on the public works committee to include funding to address not only the nations water infrastructure needs but those in pennsylvania as well the conference report includes 10 million for a critically needed environmental infrastructure and resource development program for south central pennsylvania the project authorized in section 313 of the water resources development act of 1992 would help the corps meet various environmental and economic needs of rural communities as one of the provisions primary drafters i can assure members that our intent was for the corps to accelerate normal procedures to get to actual construction as soon as possible the conference agreement is consistent with our intent regarding the section 313 program it is also consistent with language from the house appropriations committee reporton h r 2445 describing how funds should be spent while it provides only 10 million of the 17 million authorized it will help to get the corps moving in the right direction beyond preliminary study and planning and swiftly into project construction and implementation this is not merely study money it is money to get various projects up and running while 10 million is less than i had hoped for 5 million for each of the chesapeake bay and ohio river watersheds wll be helpful in meeting the regions enormous needs it is important to note that the conferees specifically rejected the senates approach to funding and implementation of the south central pennsylvania program the senate bill had provided only 700 000 barely enough to get the program moving beyond the conceptual stage and certainly not enough to get it moving quickly toward construction the conferees however adopted the houses approach of providing a significant amount of funds from the construction general account to move the program into construction in fiscal year 1994 therefore the intent is clear this program is not to be constrained by dreaout studes or lengthy preconsiruciton delays i would be remiss il i did not thank congressman j murtha for the ivaluable role he has played in both authorizing and appropriating funds for the south central pennsylvania program we worked together on the provision in the 1992 act and again in the drafting of funding provisions in this legislaflon i appreciate his leadership and help i also appreciate the appropriations committees willingness to address other water resources issues in south central pennsylvania for example the conference report provides 400 000 for a watershed reclamation and wetlands pilot project for the broad top region also it appropriates 450 000 for the corps to initiate a comprehensive study of the juniata river corridor including a reevaluation of the flood control needs of tyrone pa to avoid any possible confusion i should also clarify our intent regarding the juilata river basin study the senats bill included only 250 000 rather than 450 000 as in the house billand limited the scope of the study to just the tyrone component the conference agreement adopting the houses approach provides 450 000 for the junlata river basin including the tyrone component i am glad to have had the opportunity to clarify some of the provisions in the conference report i appreciate the work of the

rise in support of the bipartisan harmanhommccurdysaxtonsprattjohnsontalent amendment which will increase the number of c17 transport aircraft authorized in the defense authorization bill for fiscal

their useful life the harman amendment restores president clintors original budget request funding level and keeps our airlift modemizationprogram on schedule the 17 is an essential air transport program that is designed to meet our 4ations airlift needs well into the 21st century defense secretary william perry recently said our nation has a critical need for intertheater airlift modernization if we are to maintain our ability to project forces and respond to bumanitarian missions worldwide our c141 aircraft ar e wearing out the c aircraft continues to be the most costeffective means to meet current and projected airlift requirements the c17s ablity to deliver outsize cargo combined with its special capability to use austere fields will provide us with modern highly capable strategic airlift the characteristics cf the c17 jar outweigh those of other aircraft including the g5 and the c141 the c 17 can land on shorter runways and is more maneuverable on the ground than the larger 05 that requires excessively longand wide runways in many deveitping countries and remote areas where we are witnessing srnll contingent conflicts the c5 is too large to be deployed the c141 on the other hand cannot carry critical outsized cargo such as tariks helicopters and large vehicles and artillery canceling the c17 or limiting its production will not solve the problem of aging aircraft now in service such as the c141 for example army units deployed to panama in 1989 were carried entirdly by air and united states aidift assets were totally employed the massive military airlift to the persian gulf during the persian gulf war put heavy additional stress on certain models of c141s and probably shortened their remaining service life if our nation is to remain a world power we need a reliable and dependable airlift to carry troops supplies and system weapons as well as humanitarian supplies during major disasters many of my colleagues may argue that this program is overbudgeted as a member of the appropriations defense subcommittee i believe that controlling cost on weapons programs is critical the house armed services committee apprqpriations defense subcommittee and the air force have placed firm conditions on the c17 aircraft program to reducethe overall costs and ensure that it is cost efficient and meets the air forces performance requirements reducing the production rate from six aircraft to four aircraft would dramatically undercut the department of defenses strategy to control costs on the c17 and possibly make it unaffordable any further reduction in the c17 production rate would drastically increase the annual unit costs of this program by 40 to 50 million we cannot afford to keep scaling back programs like the c17 and still make this program affordable in addition we must hold the contractor accountable and demand that the aircraft is operational and manufacturing inefficiencies are corrected over the years we have invested 15 8 million in the c17 transport program by purchasing 6 aircraft in fiscal year 1995 and 8 of them in fiscal year 1996 the air force may round out its buy to what it calls a minimum viable force of 40 airplanes and with 40 c17s the air force can satisfy the minimum requirements for outsize cargo capacity the fiarman amendment will also fully fund the air forces request to try out nondevelopmental aircraft such as the 747s or newly produced 05bs theprocurement of nondevelqpmental aircraft is still an open option for the airforce there is another key issue that i want to raise today and that is jobs my state of califomia and los angeles county in particular has been exceptionally hard hit by defense downsizing and layoffs there are over 10 000 californians employed by

45 years i have been a vocal advocate for a strong viable active unitedstates merchant marine despite the intent of congress to preserve a merchant marine both for the benefits it brings to the national economy and the balance of trade and importantly for the national defense of this great nation of ours the size of our domestic commercial merchant fleet continues to decline according to the latest statistics compiled by the maritime administration the privately owned deep draft oceangoing fleet of the unitedstates merchant marine totaled 386 ships and the number continues to go downward with each passing year cargoes keep merchant ships afloat because cargoes pay the cost that was the reason in 1954 that that congress in its wisdom passed the cargo preference act which requires that all unitedstates governmentimpelled or financed cargoes shall moveon u s flag shipsthe percentage of which depending on the role of the government in that transaction some call for 50 percent others for 100 percent recently the merchant marine subcommittee on the merchant marine and fisheries committee held a hearing to explore problems the industry continues to have with federal agencies circumventing domestic cargo preference laws i want to commend the subcommittee chairman mr lipinski and mr bateman the ranking minority member for their leadership in convening the cargo preference hearing which was a continuation of an oversight hearing the subcommittee held at my request on september 30 during the course of the september hearing the committee heard testimony from several of the federal agencies which allegedly were violating these laws this time the committee had the opportunity to hear from the maritime administration and the industry and focus on the problems the industry is encountering with these same agencies because the new administration has not named anyone to head up key offices in both the state and defense departments no testimony was received from these two important agencies however chairman lipinski has assured everyone that he will hold additional hearings in the near future in order that he and his colleagues on the committee have benefit of their input the unitedstates merchant marine has taken some hard hits lately these have come from the various federal agencies which have attempted to evade and circumvent compliance with the cargo preference statutes i said earlier that the cargo preference act was passed in 1954 it was however military cargoes were ordered on unitedstates flag ships at the turn of the centuryby the congress in effect in 1904 there is no question as to the importance of a viable merchant marine history has taught all of us that victory by the allied forces during world war iiin both the european and pacific theaterswas due in large part to the merchant marine which opened a waterborne pipeline that delivered critical ordnance and supplies to the troops we won that war because the united states was capable of building 6 oceangoing shipsliberty victory t2 tankers and some c1 class in 4 short years from 1941 to 1945 that worldshattering record of production was possible because the 1936 merchant marine act had us pointed in the right direction before 194041 we dont have to strain our memories or research the history books for additional documentation the more recent events in the persian gulf again demonstrated the absolute need for a merchant marine as i have stated on earlier occasions the united states was very fortunate in its war against saddam husseln we had the benefit of a coalition of other countries which contributed to the overall campaign part of those efforts was the availability of deep draft vessels particularly the rollon rolloff type which were in short supply in both the unitedstates active and reserve fleets if the united states had to go it alone in the persian gulf war not so much militarily but with the existing logistical support and transportation systems our troops would have had serious problems during the entire persian gulf campaign including operations desert shield and desert storm a total of 405 ships was employed including 91 governmentowned ships 98 unitedstates privately owned ships and 216 foreign flag vessels as in previous wars in excess of 95 percent of all of the needed supplies ordnance and equipment was carried to the war zone by ships clearly the united states does not have a sufficient number of ships or the adequate types of ships to support our military yet it is our military and other federal agencies which continually embark on creative interpretations to circumvent our cargo preference laws these laws are designedin whole and in partto ensure that we have an adequate active merchant marine in the event of a national emergency or war and the agency that is supposed to follow through with that adequacy is the maritime administrationcommonly referred to as marad therefore today i want to begin by focusing on the maritime administrationthe very agency that is responsible for promoting the industry and which the congress empowered with the oversight responsibilities for cargo preference the reason is that during the fall of 1991 persistent complaints were coming to my office from the industry that marad was not exercising its cargo preference enforcement responsibilities properly i began corresponding with various federal agencies the defense security assistance agency the military sealift command msc the agency for international development and maradabout specific issues brought to my attention through the exchange of correspondence with these agencies i learned that in the fall of 1991 marad on its own and without a request from the sponsoring federal agency determined that a program which previously had been determined by marad to be subject to cargo preference now was said to be exempt from the law the program involved the southern region amendment transfers srai which had generated millions of dollars in revenue of unitedstates flag operators marads new determination jeopardizes future unitedstates flag operators marads new determination jeopardizes future unitedstates flag revenues from this program subsequently it was learned that marad had issued an internal legal opinion which stated that since the law authorizing these donated cargoes contained the language notwithstanding any other provision of law this military program was not subject to cargo preference to be frank this reversal was shocking however after reviewing the marad cargo preference report i believe that the notwithstanding issue was a minor problem even though marad would not explain to me why it unilaterally decided to render the questionable opinion another cargo preference matter involving the agency for international development imposed a loading delay assessment penalty on cargo preference shipments i requested marad to inform aid that the imposition of these penalties is not appropriate and to have the agency cease this activity the response from marad informed me that marad is powerless to require aid to remove these objectionable provisions from this program marad claims the cargoes are not subject to cargo preference as it contains the notwithstanding language again i did not expect to receive such a response however it clearly exposes several other serious issues since marad ruled that these shipments are not subject to cargo preference under what authority does marad finance the incremental differential for this program the only authority for such financing is provided in the merchant marine act of 1936 this authority only applies to programs which are subject to cargo preference therefore maradaccording to maradappears to lack the authority to finance any freight differential for this program yet it still has provided the financing i will be extremely interested in marads response on this issue because either marads legal opinion is faulty as i believe it is and should be retracted or marad officials have been guilty of misappropriation of funds a very serious offense marad cannot have it both ways i am very disturbed by this situation if we cannot rely on marad to provide the congress with reliable information how can we assist the industry at the close of the september 30 1992 hearing mr pickett asked thenmarad administrator captain leback what in his opinion might best do done to improve the cargo preference laws so that they would have the policy impact of requiring the carriage on american bottoms the way the committee has intended no mention was made by captain leback of the notwithstanding issue yet according to marad this language alone already has excluded approximately 1 million tons of cargo from cargo preference during the recent hearing edmund t sommer jr acting chief counsel at marad testified he apologized to the committee for any confusion the agency may have created with its explanation of the notwithstanding language opinion and he sought to set the record straight despite communications with me in which marad unequivocally states that the notwithstanding language exempts the application of cargo preference laws mr sommer testified notwithstanding is not a blanket exemption of this statute or any other statute which contains the notwithstanding language from the application of appropriate laws mr sommer continued all it does and in particular in connection with title ii is provide the administrator of aid with the authority to waive cargo preference or any other statute if in his view it is necessary to do so to provide the timely relief cargoes that are called for under the statute i would suggest that marad has not been totally honest with the committee in the past and is not now if the administrator of that agency will not come forth when specifically asked about problems with cargo preference laws then how can any of us or the industry expect compliance with the statute by the other federal agencies something doesnt add up at that agency we must deal with this problem now in addition to dealing with the violations of the other agencies of our cargo preference statutes before i conclude i would like to take just one more moment to briefly address legislation which i introducedh r 57 the merchant marine utilization and preference act of 1993 this legislation is intended to replace a 1954 interdepartmental memorandum of agreement known as the wilsonweeks agreement between the secretary of defense and the secretary of commerce my legislation would set limits on the number ofgovernmentowned ships to be operated by dod in peacetime and establishes an order of priority for obtaining additional merchant shipping when required in accordance with our national maritime policy as set forth in the merchant marine act of 1936 the emphasis is on maximum reliance on privately owned unitedstates flag shipping foreign flag shipping would be allowed only when unitedstates flag ships are not available and then only to the extent necessary to meet urgent military requirements i believe strongly that modernizing the wilsonweeks agreement and codifying it into lawwill aid greatly the unitedstates merchant it will control the use of governmentowned ships and the employment of foreign flag vessels as was witnessed during operations desert shield and desert storm our privately owned merchant marine must have cargoes if the stars and stripes is to continue to be seen in the commercial shipping world proper enforcement of the 1954 cargos preference act and controlling the use of government ships will help i yield back the balance of my time i want to commend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle
