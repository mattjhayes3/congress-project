mr lasater was known to use cocaine and distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the time he was being investigated and later indicted by the arkansas state police and the federal authorities for drug trafficking i continue to be concerned about his association president clintons with people like mr lasater and ms thomasson in the very limited hearings that we had on

the requisite number of words the amendment before us represents a sound alternative to what after all is mr clintons request for an increase in his white house budget when all is said and done the appropriations committees response funds white house activities at precisely the same level they were funded in 1992 george bushs last year yet as a candidate bill clinton talked about a 25percent cut in the white house staff many anericans are wondering at current levels whether we are not paying too much already particularly in light of the continuing allegations of grave misconduct by members of the white house staff yet bill clinton the man who promised a 25percent cut tb the american people has this year proposed an 8percent increase for the white house budgetv i congratulate my colleague the kdntlelnan from florida who did not see fit to give mr clinton more money but is instead proposing that we hold him to at least some of the spending cuts that he proposed as a candidate in light of what the white house staff has been up to it seems to me they hardly deserve a raise just 18 months ago the clinton white house started out with travelgate it consisted in the firing and smearing of honest career employees in the white house for the benefit of the clintons relatives and campaign workers even the white house press corps were scandalized by such a noxious mixture of cronyism political manipulation of law enforcement and scapegoating the likes of which washington has not seen since the spoils system was first set into motion by andrew jackson all of this certainly set the tone for what we have now come to know as the prototypical clinton scandal the cornercutting the greed cronyism and above all the deceit there has been more serious misconduct by the clinton white house than travelgate but certainly nothing more contemptible than firing and smearing longtime apolitical lowlevel government workers in order to benefit the presidents cousin and his wealthiest friends no less disgraceful was the tampering with the fbi by the white house counsels office the office in which i once served as senior associate counsel to the president the white house counsel is supposed to be preeminently responsible for preventing ethical lapses by the president and senior white house officials instead it was this white house counsels office that was the very source of the scandal including flagrant qbvious misconduct by white house lawyer william kennedy who did not contact the attorney general who did not contact fbi director sessions but interfered directly in the operations of the fbi to target specific individuals yet kennedy remains in the white house two reprimands and several additional scandals later as a seemingly permanent sourceof ethical trouble for this president and the other white house staff as we all know mr kennedy like webb hubble and vince foster and hillary rodham clinton was part ofthe same law firm that represented arkansas wheeler dealers in whitewater and madison savings and loan and dozens of other transactions including the clintons own personal finances one of the most unsavory aspects of this staff arrangement is the cronyism from the first it turned the highest echelon s of the white house legal staff and the justice department into little more than the washington branch office of the kose law firm the predictable result was the president and hillary rodham clinton felt they could treat the white house lawyers as their personal lawyers bu t federal law prohibits government employees including the white house counsels office from performing private services for the president yet shortly before his death vince foster was working in his white house office in the west wing on government time at taxpayer expense at preparing the delinquent whitewater tax returns not only was this improper because it was the personal investment business of the clintons rather than official business but it also covered a period well before the clintons took office most observers who have commented on this fact have speculated on its relevance to mr fosters death as a former member of the counsels office i am at least as struck by its obvious impropriety using a fulltime government lawyer to work on the clinton familys personal business affairs is clearly improper i recall very well the extraordinary pains that for example president reagan took to ensure that none of the white house lawyers worked on his personal business his tax returns were prepared by his own private lawyers and his accountants even his blind trust which unlike the clintons was set up before his inauguration was prepared at his personal expense obviously the clinton white house does not follow the same ethical guidelines what does this mean from a budget standpoint obviously it means today in 1994 we are already paying for too much white house staff yet the size and the composition of the white house staff whose budget we

how i can help the president by sending money to the democrat congressional committee and also by sending back their survey but i was fascinated by some of what was in this letter it was addressed to me i mean it says dear robert s walker and then it says to me you are one of a select group of democrats from around the nation whom im asking to take part in this important survey now obviously this is a computer glitch that got this to me but it did reveal some very fascinating things for example there is an underlying paragraph here that says unfortunately newt gingrich and his rightwing allies succeeded in cutting our congressional majority in last years election and all i could say was yippee and so that was the right thing i also kind of had the feeling at that point that i ought to start flapping my right wing but the fact is that they are admitting here that the gentleman from georgia has in fact gotten his message across to the american people and that we are in fact beginning to win new majorities but then it goes on and it tells the american people a couple of fascinating things it says here because the success or failure of the clinton administration depends upon which party has control of the congress righto i say to my colleagues if you wanted to have the clinton administration succeed what tom foley is telling you in this letter is you want democrats in the congress if you dont want the clinton administration to succeed with higher taxes and more spending you want to change the congress the gentleman from washington is absolutely right and i am pleased that he sent me this letter then he went on down here this is a fascinating little p s that they put on the letter it says if the republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda well let me tell you after spending some time at home over the last several weeks and listening to what people are having to say about bill clintons agenda my guess is that this is an admission by speaker foley that the republicans are going to take control of the congress let me repeat that to you it says if republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda america at this point wants to cripple bill clintons agenda they have decided that this tax and spend is not what they want tom foley is telling you america what you should do tom foley is saying elect republicans to congress because if republicans gain control of the congress we will stop bill clintons agenda thanks speaker foley for this letter this is a very revealing

of the federal reserve board and its total lack of accountability one reason that there is dire need to have accountability is that all history shows no matter irrespective of what society all through mankinds recorded history that when power particularly tremendous power or wholesale grants of power flow to any individual group of individuals no matter what whether they be public private even religious institutions that there will be a corruption and misuse of that power ultimately the fundamental premise of our government even before the constitution and even during the beginning and the first glimmers of nationhood the question of accountability was foremost for example the issue the first and second continental congresses and then the body under the articles of confederation was what is technically known as fiscal agent or banker was goingto be used and if any of my colleagues would like to know what such great americans as thomas jefferson thought of bankers and the confraternity i invite you to read his remarks about it but at this point for whatever reason and particularly since the war that is the 1940s neither the congress which created the federal reserve board incidentallythe federal reserve board was not heavensentit was created by the congress and the congress has not seen fit nor the executive branch in its power to appoint the chairman and some of the members has not been able to have any kind of accountability flowing from the federal reserve board as a result americans know and are feeling now the effects of this unaccountability of power because it is the power that determines the allocation of a credit who does it who will benefit who will have access to credit which always from the beginning of our nationhood has been the cen tral question with the federal reserve insisting that it has an almost divine right to retain its regulatory function over bank holding companies as i brought out last night and the night before it may come as a surprise to some that the central bank came into this position of power as an accident of the political battles with the nixon administration for example interest rates all during the war president roosevelt and the government did not have to pay even an average of 2 percent on its borrowing to wage and win the war how did that happen how could that have been done when now the government has to pay not only interest of huge amounts in fact just a few years ago it was paying as much as 16 percent on longterm bonds which is usury but worse than that it is compound interest we keep going that way and forget about ever resolving the national debt which is now really not acceptable over 4 trillion and that does not account for the private debt that is us americans and corporate debt which is almost equal to that governmental debt so we are in deep trouble and it is the policies set by a board that has no responsibility to account for its actions to anybody in the name of what independence so what the difference is that after the war and when we went into the 1970s and the nixon administration things happened that changed everything from the management of the debt and the handling of the debt and the function that the congress set forth for the federal reserve board has been usurped the federal reserve board act of 1913 says the federal reserve board shall be the fiscal agent of the unitedstates treasury but lo and behold it is the one that is printing our money i ask my colleagues to reach into your pockets and pick out any note a 1 note 5 note 10 note 20 note and see if you do not see federal reserve note that used to be not too long ago unitedstates treasury note therein is a big story but during the nixon period in the banking industry then under the head of paul volcker later the chairman of the fed who was then at the chase manhattan bank presented a plan to scatter the feds regulatory authority to three different agencies and the rest is history i will continue to bring out the sorry and dreary results to the detriment of americans who find themselves as jefferson said we will find ourselves americans homeless rootless in our own land made so by the bankers with the federal reserve insisting that it has an almost divine right to retain its regulatory functions over bank holding companies it may come as a surprise to some that the central bank came into this position of power as an accident of political batties with the nixon administration some would also be surprised that the nixon administrations treasury department with its banker leadership including paul volcker then at chase manhattan bank presented a plan to scatter the feds regulatory authority to three different agencies it was the great former house banking chairman wright patman who was compelled to choose the lesser of two evils in 1970to allow the federal reserve to retain its present authority just as the holding company plan of organization was beginning to spread throughout the banking industry over the last two decades the holding company form of organization of banks has exploded today the federal reserve regulates holding companies which have 93 percent of the countrys banking assets before the 1970s the federal reserve had few regulatory responsibilities and it did not protest or cry that it needed to supervise banks and bank holding companies in order to formulate monetary policy the historical record shows this endowment of regulatory power is merely the result of political fights in the 1960s and 1070s between former house banking chairman wright patman the office of the comptroller of the currencywhich examines national banksand the nixon administration which wanted to weaken control over bank holding companies by giving it to three banking regulators to avoid this scenario the congress passed legislation in 1970 giving full authority to the federal reserve to regulate bank holding companies although the 1933 banking act provided for mild regulation of bank holding companies it exempted most onebank holding companies ostensibly on the grounds that they were small local enterprises that shouldnt be subject to onerous regulation the federal reserve historically had been conservative in its approach to nonbanking activities and had established relatively narrow limits on bank holding companies activities after the passage of the 1956 bank holding company act however in the 1960s the office of the comptroller of the currency beginning with comptroller james saxon allowed holding companies to branch to the outer limits by approving a variety of nonbank acquisitions and activities by national banks even though existing law prohibited banks from getting into nonbanking businesses eventually comptroller saxon had to defend his positions in lawsuit after lawsuit brought by entities threatened by the entry of banks into their business saxon lost consistently in the courts the comptrollers liberal policy was a bonanza to large banks by the late 1960s large banks anxious to bypass the law and expand their role in commercehad seized on the loophole and formed onebank holding companies that branched into a wide range of activities even shakeys pizza parlors and s h green stamps with the explosion of the myth of onebank holding companies being sleepy rural entities the banking industry saw the opportunity to weaken federal restrictions on multibank holding companies as well the nixon administration took up the cause of both reducing regulation of bank holding companies and taking regulatory authority away from the federal reserve even before nixon took office his transition team made it clear that holding company legislation would be one of the administrations first initiatives president nixons treasury departmentheaded by david kennedy president and ceo continental illinois national bank charls walker executive director the american bankers association and paul volcker of chase manhattan bank and later federal reserve chairmandrafted legislation which broadened the closely related clause for holding company activities and scattered the regulation among the
