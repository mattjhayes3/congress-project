commemoration a memorial tribute to one of the great people of the house sala burton basically what i said was that to me sala burton had the glamour of a marlene deitrich and the heart and good will of a mother teresa and the political savvy of a golda meir if anyone read the congressio al record when my distin guished colleague mr edwards dean of the california delegation introduced the privilege resolution they would know the overwhelming expression of grief and love for sala she was really a mother a sister and a friend to all of us she cared in a very special way for people she really did love her roots her family her country the congress and she had a real affectionthose callfornians stick togetherfor the california delegation she certainly loved san francisco she was extremely proud to represent and it was americas perfect city with its great diversity of people she meant very very much to the wives of the members of course she was the cofounder of the congressional wives task force and always reached out to make them feel a part of congress sala often told me of the pride and love she had for her daughter and her soninlaw and her grandchildren she admired her daughters abilities and independence her parents meant very very much to her her mother still is living god bless her and she had a marvelous impression from her parents she often talked about her fathers brilliance and her mothers common sense and their interest in current affairs she was very proud of her brotherinlaw john and believed he had tremendous values as did her husband and values that are known in california indeed nationally as the great burton tradition she was proud of johns personal courage as well and proud of her brotherinlaw bob as well she was very very proud of her brother and her nephew tom who was so gracious to so many of us during salas illness i want to say this about her staff she felt that they were an extended part of her family and they ought to know how much affection sala had for them and how much it meant to her that they carried on during her illness so in a very special way all of us can claim sala in a very real way of course she loved her beloved phillip as she would say you could not talk to her for any length of time without knowing of the respect and love she had for her husband she quoted him often she felt even after he died that she was an extension of him but sala in her own right was a magnificent congresswoman and a very savvy politician she was intensely political and long before she became a congresswoman she served her political apprenticeship she traced her interest to her childhood in prewar poland she said i saw and felt what happened n western europe when the nazis were moving you learn politics is everybodys business she had instant clout in the house when we look at her assignments we see that she was practically hmmedlately after a term of being here assigned to the prestigious committee the committee on rules she was a delegate to the north atlantic assembly where 60 parliamentarians from nato elected her vice chair of the political committee last spring in luxembourg i saw her chair the committee and i saw the love and esteem of our allies and our fellow and sister parliamentarians who really thought that she was so outstanding she knew how to get things done one can recall the many instances in which sala did in fact buttonhole her friends i said in san francisco that she buttonholed the men in congress by flicking the lint from their lapels rather than twisting their arms her style was different from phils to say the least but it was equally as effective so how do we accept her death one of the things that sala was most proud of really was her jewish background so i quoted from the mourners kaddish in which there are a line or two that indicate that thru the long centuries and this is a quote from that beautiful prayer thru the long centuries we have learned to rise in the face of every storm out of the abyss of anguish on the ashes of every destruction to praise gods name to maintain a stance of human dignity and to affirm our consecration to the task of life that was her goal life was so important to her and she was consecrated to this the wednesday before salas death i had the great privilege of visiting her along with senator alan cranston and my friend and colleague the gentleman from california don edwands and at the end i whispered a few words to sala and she said to me and the last words she said to me were tell everyone i think of them and love them and she said goodbye mary rosewell talk which was a common expression of saas we will talk about salafor we will think of her legacy and her values that wonderful burton tradition we know that already there have been a number of things that people are proposing to name after her such as the sala burton maritime museum which of course was part of her legislation to have that funded properly and the gentleman from arizona mr mo udall did change the name in the legislation naming it after her one of the things that i would like to suggest i have introduced a bill that would allow the staff and people who work on the hill to have access to a daycare center and that has been passed i think that it would really be an honor for me to know that my legislation somehowand the gentlewoman from colorado mrs pat schroeder is the one who suggested it and i think it is a great ideato somehow dedicate that daycare center to the memory of our friend sala burton so we accept her death in the sense of alfred lord tennyson when he recalled in his wonderful poem in memoriam when he had the death of one of his dear friends thrust upon him and he was wondering how he could accept this great tragedy one of the lines that he uttered then and which is recorded for all of us immortally is something that consoles me very much when i think of her and that is ris better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all we all loved sala burton and we will talk to her many many times"], [0.0022278428077697754, 0.9977721571922302, 1, "i ask unanimous consent that the committee on post office

expand their lending revise and extend their remarks on the the home loan bank act was subject of this special order signed by president hoover ina turbulent time the campaign that would lead to roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive as ever after 50 years we still have not reached

the gentleman from texas and the gentleman from pennsylvania as to the real testing amendment as opposed to the counterfeit amendment that language i do not think bears any relationship to what we are considering but nevertheless let me explain what has happened on the floor of this house some 240plus members voting we voted in this supplemental bill to preclude the administration from pursuing any drug testing and the debate centered on the question that the congress ought to be involved in adopting procedures to effect such drug testing which protected the rights of the employees being tested i mentioned in debate that they ought to have input into the procedures that they ought to have the opportunity to know what they were being tested for that they had the opportunity to ensure themselves of privacy i might say the gentleman from florida when we considered his amendment which dealt with a small segment of federal employees in the state department indicated in debate that he would be against any amendment which did not provide for the privacy of the employees i indicated further that we needed to provide for the integrity and credibility of the testing organizations the labs the process i would suggest that the senate language attempted to do that we have not passed an authorizing bill so that protection will be included within the ambit of this supplemental appropriation bill i want to bring to the attentiorn of members contrary again to the remarks of the gentleman from pennsylvania there was no backdoor meeting there were no smokefilled room meetings in fact most of the meetings that occurred occurred at the request of the administration namely mr miller of omb and those meetings were requested by the administration to try to work out the differences between the house again over 240 people sustaining the house language to preclude testing until authorizing legislation or parameters were set for such testing and the senate language which set some parameters those meetings occurred as a matter of fact there were at least two major meetings and some smaller meetings those meetings were attended by a number of people from the senate committee on treasury and postal service and myself and the language that is now included in the supplemental appropriation bill conference report is the language that was agreed to ultimately by all the negotiators all of the negotiators and let me stress that so that i do not misrepresent the position of anybody director miller of the office of management and budget who was the point person for the administration in these negotiations did seek to have report language which related to court review ultimately i will tell my colleagues that on the other side of the aisle from mine in the senate it was suggested that that language would not accomplish anything and would imply that the courts would consider frivolous suits so that language was omitted from the report language not the bill language the bill language is as agreed by everybody on both committees on both sides of the aisle so this is a bipartisan conference agreement no objection to the language it does not preclude judicial review and in point of fact in my opinion could not legally preclude judicial review in point of fact i think that was generally agreed to by the representatives of the justice department and others from the administration however it does not require judicial review in point of fact as some of my colleagues may have read it was the justice departments perception that this member backed down on demanding that the testing be conducted pursuant to regulations pursuant to the administrative procedures act in point of fact i did not back down i acceded to the administrations suggestion that the testing go forward under guidelines we call them mandatory guidelines to make sure that everybody understands that they are to be followed they are not directory they are not suggestive they are mandatory guidelines again to protect those rights of which the gentleman from florida talked and which were discussed during the course of debate in the house on this initial passage of the supplemental appropriation bill on which this language was added as a result of going from regulations under the administrative procedure act and as a result of specifically exempting this drug testing procedure from that act saying that it was governed by this act the mandatory guidelines language we acceded to the administrations request that we not try to procedurally undermine drug testing i agreed on that why did i agree on it i believe and i do not believe i represent perhaps the majority opinion on this floor but i believe that random mandatory drug testing of employees without cause is unconstitutional but that view is not prevailing i understand that so what we have done in the senate and in the house notwithstanding the fact that of course it has not passed the house floor nor has it passed to the senate floor and to that extent it is like every amendment that we have adopted today every amendment that we have adopted today on this supplemental appropriation as clearly the gentleman from pennsylvania knows well it does not preclude judicial review that is correct we could not do that but let me say this it was agreed that we could not do it so that the language proposed by the conference committee subjects this procedure to no more judicial review than with the senate language initially"], [0.00015050172805786133, 0.5001505017280579, 1, "i rise in support of the major fraud act of 1988 ilr 3911 which was reported favorably to the house of representatives by the committee on the judiciary by voice vote on may 3 1988 this major criminal procurement fraud bill is a needed complement to action taken in the 99th congress on the civil side when we passed the false claims amendment act of 1986 and the program fraud civil renedies act the motivating force behind this new criminal antifraud bill is that the development and enforcement of what is called white collar crime statutes is not only demanded in the interest of justice in this area but can often result in substantial cost savings in the form or reduced los =es in fraud to the governnent a strikin example of this phenon non occurred in the late seventies and early eighties when the department of just ice participated in wideranging prosecutions of bid rigging by highway contractors throughout the united states as a result of this concentrated effort there were prosecutions in over 15 states which produced indictments of over 180 companies and 200 executives numerous jail sentences and fines totaling 41 million resulted from this effort with a conviction rate of over 90 percent in early 1983 the wall street journal in a followup story reported that the cost of constructing highways in the national had fallen significantly in some cases by as much its 25 to 30 percent below the engineering estimates this was attributed in part to this massive law enforcement effort which had disrupted an illegal way of life in the highway construction btusiness this experience added credence to the theory that the deterrent power of the law when enforced can be very strong especially in the area of white collar crime h r 3911 is just such a bill it is based upon hearings by the subcommittee on crime and a review of numerous other congressional department of justice and department of defense investigations of procurement fraud over the last two decades i will not here reiterate the litany of successive scandals in spare parts overhead overcharges malfunctioning equipment product substitution and so forth that have been exposed in this testimony but to say the least it documents a story of greed malfeasance and other fraudulent schemes that bilk the american taxpayers of billions of dollars and at the same time diminish our citizens confidence in the executive branchs ability to efficiently administer essential governmental functions these investigations are not merely a history lesson but are a collection of facts that describe a relatively small but extremely malignant blight on our society which is continuing for instance the gao just released a report in january 1988 in which it estimated a loss due to procurement fraud of 387 million in but 148 open procuremient cases reported to the secretary of defense from april 1 1985 through march 31 1986 the report also noted that in fiscal year 1986 there were some 1 919 new fraud investigations as compared with fiscal year 1983 when there were 870 such investigations this gao study by the way included only 32 product substitution cases which are a priority for dod in the product substitution area alone cases where contractors deliberately provide inferior products on dod contracts which can directly cost americans their lives investigations have increased to the point where there have been 85 indictments since january 1986 as of october 1987 the defense criminal investigative service idc1 was actively lnvolved in another 231 ii r 3911 as amended is fas hioned to meet many of these problems and to create a new deterrent to criminal fraud it creates a new federal procurement fraud offense involving contracts of 1 million or more and is patterned after the bank fraud act 18 unitedstatesc 1344 this i am told would cover 3ome 9 900 prime contracts under current conditions the maximum prison sentence that could b imposed is 10 years this is conaistent with the maximum in comparable legislation the bill adds a clause providing for a mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years if the offense involves a foreseeable and substartial ii 3086 risk of personal injury this is to cover those egregious situations usually in product substitution cases where a contractor provides such items as defective parachute cords faulty jet ejection seat valves or defective nozzles for fire fighting equipment on ships these provisions should act as an additional deterrent to individuals the bill then proposes an alternate fine that could be imposed upon conviction of up to 10 000 000 which should be a new deterrent to corporate fraud the bill also would provide an extension of the statute of limitations in which prosecutions could be initiated to 7 years rather than the normal 5 years to accommodate the extensive investigation oftin required in this type of fraud in addition the bill establishes a new system of rewards under which up to 250 000 can be paid from the criminal fine to individuals who provide information leading to a conviction as well as private whistleblowers protection for these informants based upon provisions included in the false claims act amendments of 1986 31 unitedstatesc 3730h the bill does set limitations on who can receive these rewards above and beyond the fact that the doj must recommend and the court must approve such a reward those ineligible are first government employees performing their official duties second workers who could have come forward with information to an employer at the formative stage of an offense and could have prevented it or stopped it and third individuals who participated in the offense i believe the major fraud act of 1988 will become not only a major deterrent to procurement fraud but an incentive fur responsible individuals to come forward with information in the prosecution of major fraud when it occurs this bill will protect the taxpayers the honest businessman and our procurement

standardization and safety reform act of 1986 legislation introduced by mr moorhead to provide certain reforms in federal nuclear oversight activities promote standardization of futur9 nuclear generating plants and therefore provide an added degree of safety toi the commercial nuclear energy industry this is an important bill whose time not only has come but is over due nuclear standardization is not a new concepl europe has had a great deal of success with standardized designs and that success is reflected in the significantly higher percentage of power generated from nuclear sources as compared with the united states the japanese have embraced the technology as well in the united states our own experience with standardized plants has been limited to a few multiple units on a single site such as palo verde 1 11 and iii and st lucie i and ii in these few instances however the subsequent units have not only been less expensive to construct but also constructed in shorter periods of time thus providing needed electricity to growing areas such as arizona and florida as the electricity needs of these and other regions of the country continue to grow so grows the importance of promoting standardization of nuclear facilities as for the safety of standardized nuclear plants common sense tells us that standardized plants should be safer because the lessons learned at one plant would be easily passed on to the others even opponents of nuclear power have testified in favor of standardized designs because of the added safety factor but standardization would not be limited to the design of the plant itself but would be carried over into the training operation and maintenance programs of the plant in the united states we have just begun to use standardized trainingin part because of the lessons learned after three mile island even so there have been real improvements in training programs because of this use of standardization and the same should be done with plant designs as this countrys need for electricity grows there is even more reason to promote standardized nuclear designs as i have ststed they are less expensive and less time consuming to construct in addition nuclear energy is cleaner than fossil fuel in my opinion our electric utility industry is being threatened with unwarranted environmental regulations while at the same time they are trying to provide power to a demanding public if more utilities could make the decision to build nuclear plants to either add capacity or replace old plants both demands could be satisfied but standardization seems to be the key i hope that my colleagues would join in our effort to promote the nuclear standardization and safety reform act as a reasonable approach to addressing

represents the area involved had expressed concerns with the legislation last year that it could set a dangerous precedent for this area unfortunately congress has never established a permanent boundary for gettysburg park although an administrative boundary was negotiated in 1974 it was never established by congress the land parcel included in this bill is adjacent to but not within the 1974 administrative boundary consequently mr goodlings concerns which were certainly wellfounded stemmed from the fact that as additional land is added to the park the local tax base is adversely
