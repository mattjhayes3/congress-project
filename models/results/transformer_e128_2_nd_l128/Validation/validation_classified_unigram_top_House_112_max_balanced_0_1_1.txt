medicare their health care is too good and grandma and grandpa they didnt do enough for america so the democrats we turn around and say hey how about looking at it this way how about before you go after grandma and her medicare card and how about you say to warren buffet hey how about not taking those extra tax breaks and the republicans say we cant take away any tax breaks from warren buffet and all of the other multimultimillionaires and billionaires because theyve contributed so much to america we dont want to touch their money even though that would give us hundreds of billions of dollars and then we say to them well how about prescription drugs how about we negotiate the price for prescription drugs for medicare the way we do with the va that would save about a quarter of a trillion dollars over a 10year period they say that would be unfair to the drug companies we cant touch them either then we say to them well you know the war in iraq the war in afghanistan its winding down now maybe we could look into the defense budget and save a few billion dollars there before we ask grandma to sacrifice on the health care that she gets from medicare and the republicans say we cant do that either we cant look at any cuts in the defense budget that would be much too hard on those defense contractors so then we say to them how about the oil industry at least the oil industry the 40 billion in tax breaks which theyre going to get over the next 10 years i mean does anyone in america really believe that they need tax breaks in order to have an incentive to go out and drill for oil when people are paying 3 3 50 4 a gallon at the pump but the republicans say no you cant touch the oil companies either youve got to give big tax breaks to the oil industry as well even as theyre tipping grandma and grandpa upside down at the pump when theyre coming in to put in their unleaded 4 a gallon gasolineselfserve by the wayat the pump so what do they do instead what they do is they put an oil rig on top of the medicare card so that the oil industry can drill into grandmas medicare and pull out the funding in order to provide the tax breaks for big oil for warren buffet for the prescription drug industry for the wars in iraq and afghanistan its all off of grandma shes the one weve targeted the person responsible for all of the wasteful spending in the united states its all grandmas fault lets cut medicare she didnt do enough to build our country through the 1930s the 1940s the 1950s and the 1960s its all on grandma so this drill rig that they are building into the pocketbooks of grandma in order to find that funding thats what their plan is all about its an oil pipeline into the pocketbooks of the seniors they want to cut checkups for grandma while they cut checks for the oil companies they want to cut health care to grandma and give wealth care to big oil companies and to billionaires and to prescription drug companies their plan is big tax breaks for big oil and tough breaks for grandma and for the seniors in our country and the ceo of chevron he says its unamerican to think about increasing taxes on the oil industry you know what i say to him its unbelievable that you could make that argument but even more unbelievable that the republican party would accept that argument and cut medicare for grandma to privatize it to hand it over to the insurance industry to increase the cost by 6 000 per year for their costs even as they say to warren buffet the oil companies the big drug companies the arms contractors dont worry were going to protect your programs its just grandma thats on the cutting block so ladies and gentlemen this is a debate of historical dimensions and until the republicans come forward with a planwhich they dont have in order to make medicare solventby raising the revenues out of these other areas from millionaires from the oil industry and from others do not expect us to say to grandma its her fault its not

our shared values from world war ii to 9 11 to hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and those who are less fortunate thats never been an american

on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut

the transportation security subcommittee of homeland security of which i am a member industry witnesses raised serious concerns about the efficacy of the surface transportation inspection program here are some of the concerns raised at the hearing most surface inspectors have no surface transportation experience or surface security background whatsoever many surface inspectors were promoted from screening passengers at airports these inspectors report to the federal security directors at local airports who commonly also do not possess any surface transportation experience at least one local tsa official indicated he is always looking for things for his inspectors to do to occupy their time most surface inspectors have two things to look for in a typical day whether a transit system is reporting incidents to the tsa and a box is checked on their clipboard and whether there is a security person on duty another box to be checked on a clipboard the work of these inspectors is redundant performed by employees of other agencies such as the department of transportation osha or epa and on and on what they do is ultimately slow down commerce on our nations rails and highways since 2008 tsa has more than doubled the size of the transportation inspection workforce and quadrupled the programs budget yet according to the majority of stakeholders we heard from there has been almost no tangible improvement in security as a result of these investments last year tsas entire surface transportation security budget was 126 million of this amount surface inspectors cost taxpayers 54 million which does not even include headquarters administration oversight and staff associated with the program this means that the surface transportation inspection program which has been labeled as ineffective by a number of freight rail passenger service bus and mass transit agencies is consuming more than 40 percent of the entire surface transportation security budget millions of americans rely on surface transportation every day more than 8 million people use public transportation in new york city alone despite this need less than 2 percent of the tsas nearly 8 billion budget goes toward securing our nations surface transportation systems and a large portion of that limited budget is being squandered on this ineffective inspection program surface transportation security is too important to our national economy and receives too small a portion of homeland security funding to waste a single dollar opponents of this amendment may argue that it will result in federal inspectors being put out of work it will not we are transferring money to implement more productive security measures within tsa the question is simply why should taxpayers especially those who rely on surface transportation every day have to fund a program that has no proven ability to enhance security my amendment today seeks to limit the inspector program budget to 20 million which would substantially reduce its size and allow the saved money to be put forward in other more effective surface programs such as canine detection units particularly at bus and rail stations this amendment strengthens

bipartisan group for nearly a decade have been talking about this arguing not to expand the war not to be over there not to be in nation building and the american people didnt pay much attention now they are the large majority of the american people now say its time to get out of afghanistan its a fruitless venture too much has been lost the chance of winning since we dont even know what we are going to win doesnt exist so they are tired of it financially theres a good reason to come home as well some argue we have to be there because if we leave under these circumstances well lose face it will look embarrassing to leave so how many more men and women have to die how many more dollars have to be spent to save face that is one of the worst arguments possible we are not there under legal conditions this is a war who says it isnt a war everybody talks about the afghan war was the war declared of course not it wasnt declared there was a resolution passed that said that the president at that time under the emergency of 9 11 could go and deal with al qaeda those who brought upon the 9 11 bombings but al qaeda is not there anymore so we are fighting the taliban the taliban used to be our allies at one time when the soviets were there the talibans main goal is to keep the foreign occupation out they want foreigners out of their country they are not al qaeda yet most americansmaybe less so now but the argument here on the floor is we have got to go after al qaeda this is not a war against al qaeda if anything it gives the incentive for al qaeda to grow in numbers rather than dealing with them the money issue we are talking about a lot of money how much do we spend a year probably about 130 billion up to 1 trillion now in this past decade later on in the day we are going to have two votes we are going to have a vote on doing something sensible making sense out of our foreign policy bringing our troops home and saving hundreds of billions of dollars then we also will have a vote against npr to cut the funding of npr there is a serious question about whether that will even cut one penny but at least the fiscal conservatives are going to be overwhelmingly in support of slashing npr and then go home and brag about how they are such great fiscal conservatives and the very most they might save is 10 million and thats their claim to fame for slashing the budget at the same time they wont consider for a minute cutting a real significant amount of money all empires end for fiscal reasons because they spread themselves too far around the world and thats what we are facing we are in the midst of a military conflict that is contributing to this inevitable crisis and its financial and you would think there would be a message there how did the soviets come down

would be precise and only go to war with a declaration of war with the people behind us knowing who the enemy is and fight win and get it over with that would be more legitimate they dont do it now

and sometimes in the 1minute and 5minutes that members present to you here in this great deliberative place that we have the privilege to serve in one of the things that i wanted to bring before your attention here this evening is the immigration issue here in the united states it is something that i dont know has been discussed here for some time i bring this forward because it is an important issue it is essential that we maintain and sustain and enhance the rule of law here in the united states so i bring this forward a number of things are on my mind the first thing that comes to mind for me is a subject that was reported on fox news on july 11 i picked up this article and i wanted to express this to you on what is going on i introduced early in january one of the first days of business here in this new 112th congress the birthright citizenship act of 2011 i brought this act forward working with people who have been leaders on this issue for some time one of them would be our friend nathan deal now governor deal of georgia who was the lead on this issue when he served in the united states congress and some of the successor people involved would be congressman phil gingrey of georgia and the incoming freshman from georgia rob woodall from california congressman gary g miller one who has been a strong proponent of the rule of law and standing up for the rights of american citizens these people and others have been strong supporters of the birthright citizenship act and because of my role on the immigration committee where i have been for now going onto the 9th year it seemed to be a better fit for me to carry this legislation so i stepped forward with it because we needed to take a position what is going on is that in the united states of america there are people who erroneously read the 14th amendment of the constitution in the component that addresses what we call birthright citizenship it says in the 14th amendment that all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are american citizens all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are american citizens now the circumstances are that it has created a misinterpretation a misinterpretation of this section of the 14th amendment has created birthright tourism so we have you might see a 30 000 turnkey operation going on where a pregnant woman in china and she is probably going to have a benefactor that would sponsor this could receive a turnkey operation for a little tourism trip into the united states get her on an airplane and smuggle her into the united states one way or another where she would have a baby she would be 81 2 months pregnant or so theoretically and have the baby here in the united states the baby would get a nice new american birth certificate with his little footprint stamped on it and then that baby might go back to china with the babys mother or the mother might stay here in the united states with family and friends whoever might want to harbor that mother and or child and when that child is old enough the child can sponsor the entire family to come in the united states by virtue of that automatic citizenship that is conferred upon a child that is born here to an illegal mother and a whoknows father that is going on not just in rare circumstances and certainly not just with chinese in fact that is not one of the larger numbers it is happening in this country someplace between 340 000 times a year and 750 000 times a year we have a people that sneak into the united states for the purpose of having a baby so that baby can become an american citizenship i believe as the chairman of the full judiciary committee lamar smith believes that citizenship should be precious it should be precious it shouldnt be dealt out it shouldnt be something that you can buy a turnkey ticket to game the system to have a baby that then is automatically an american citizen subject to the jurisdiction thereof i will argue that chinese woman that flies into the united states with a 30 000 turnkey tourism for birthright is not subject to the jurisdiction of the united states not in the way that was envisioned by the people that wrote the 14th amendment to the constitution the 14th amendment to the constitution was put in place to guarantee that the babies born to formerly slaves and then at that time of ratification freed slaves would be american citizens that the babies born to the freed slaves would not be denied all of the rights of citizenship as were guaranteed to them in the 13th and 14th amendments and it took into account that babies born on indian reservations some of them would have lost their rights their tribal rights on those reservations if they had become automatic american citizens so some of the native americans said no they didnt want that conferred upon them the drafters of the 14th amendment then wrote language in it to preclude automatic citizenship to any homo sapien that was born within the territory of the united states they also had to be subject to the jurisdiction thereof and this congress went through a great deal of debate in the house and in the senate on what that actually meant in the clause subject to the jurisdiction thereof it was not contemplated that the children of diplomats would become automatic american citizens it was not contemplated that certain native americans born on certain reservations would be subject to the jurisdiction thereof and become american citizens but it was contemplated that the children born to freed slaves would be american citizens it is a guarantee and it was written with a significant amount of wisdom they could not have anticipated that america would get so lazy and so lax that this constitutional amendment would drift its way into a practice an erroneous practice of conferring automatic citizenship on mostly any baby that would be born in america now here is how it is if there is a plane flying through the united states and lets just say this plane is bound from china to toronto which does happen and it was going to be a flight that was going to be a direct flight and drop into toronto but because of weather conditions or maybe mechanical problems it had to land in chicago lets just say if there is a woman pregnant on that plane who is flying into toronto and the plane lands in chicago and it is stuck there for mechanical repairs or a weatherrelated delay and the woman is inside security and has the baby the baby is not an american citizen but if she walks through the security is outside the security during the layover and has the baby out there this baby is an american citizen that is what has been going on in the practice of this automatic citizenship that i think is an erroneous misinterpretation and i think a willful misinterpretation or probably more often a lazy misinterpretation of the 14th amendment of the constitution and so i have introduced the birthright citizenship act of 2011 along with the friends and colleagues that i have mentioned and many others and a good number of cosponsors who take the position with me that if a child is born in america has to be born to at least one legal parent in order to be a citizen of the united states it is pretty simple it clarifies the 14th amendment it clarifies the clause in the 14th amendment subject to the jurisdiction thereof congress has the authority to do that i got concerned about this when there were a couple of senators who were talking about the need to amend the constitution to fix this problem it doesnt require a constitutional amendment to fix the automatic citizenship practice that is so flawed that it confers an automatic citizenship on as many as 750 000 babies born to illegal parents here in the united states to give you an example as i said its not just a chinese woman who comes over here pregnant to have the baby hereand that happens on a very regular basis its often someone who comes in from a neighboring country we know of the criminal aliens that are in our prisons twothirds of them come from mexico one might presume that of a similar number of these automatic citizenship babies also their mothers are citizens of mexico who are in the united states illegally having the babies here and picking up that automatic citizenship that birth certificate they may or may not go back to their home country but you can bet that when the time comes that that child will already be programmed to petition for the family reunification plan which has our immigration plan in america out of controlout of control so what do we do about this the birthright citizenship act of it should be a simple decision for this united states congress to address this situation but some will argue well subject to the jurisdiction thereof means nothing that that clause in the 14th amendment doesnt have meaning therefore it requires that they all be citizens i think that is a very thin and a very marginal argument at best the clause must mean something all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are american citizens there is a reason that it says and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if everyone born in the territory of the united states is automatically a citizen you would strike that language from the 14th amendment and subject to the jurisdiction thereof and it would simply read all persons born or naturalized in the united states are american citizens if that were the intent if that were the understanding of the 14th amendment thats what it would have said but it says and subject to the jurisdiction thereof the definition of that phrase is subject to the interpretation of the understanding of what it meant at the time of the ratification of the 14th amendment and it meant that subject to the jurisdiction thereof didnt mean that there was going to be automatic citizenship for illegals granted we didnt have much for immigration laws at the time there wasnt enough human migration to be very concerned about it but they clearly didnt intend to confer automatic citizenship on native americans born on reservations that were not subject to the jurisdiction of the united states they clearly didnt intend to confer automatic citizenship on the children born to the diplomats or their staff or for tourists for that matter i mention the tourism part when i explain what happens if a plane lands in chicago on its way to toronto and a baby is born which side of the security here is automatic citizenship on the unitedstates side of the security thats nuts but weve gotten lazy and lax with the practice of conferring automatic citizenship so people dont challenge it and im really worried about an administrationactually ive been worried about a couple of those administrations since ive arrived in this townthat doesnt seem to have much vigor for enforcing immigration law its pretty frustrating to be here in the united states congress pounding away to have to pass legislation to fix something thats just a matter of intellectual laziness but the people who are enforcing this the people who are handing out birth certificates almost like candy arent challenging it they dont have a very good constitutional understanding or there would be some pushback out there from across the countryside in the ob ward of the hospitals around the country theyve got to have stacks of these birth certificates and when a baby is born its almost an automatic process here is the footprint here is the data here is the birth certificate send that child off hes an american citizen what do we suppose happens if a diplomat or the wife of a diplomat or even a staff of the diplomat comes into the hospital to have a baby do they meet them at the door and say do you happen to be a diplomat are you here on some kind of foreign immunity and youre planning on having a baby here and do you think that baby is going to be an american citizen no were not going to allow it citizenship is not going to be cheapened like that that doesnt happen what really happens is the children of diplomats are often conferred with automatic citizenship because the whole system of america is so automatic that any baby born inside the unitedstates territory is just given the paperwork and the documents here is an article that came out on fox news as i mentioned a little bit earlier reported on july 11by good thorough people i might add this is elizabeth robichaux brown who has written this article the center for immigration studies says foreign diplomats are obtaining unitedstates birth certificates and social security numbers for their newborn childreneffectively becoming unitedstates citizens on top of their new status in the world these children carry an additional perk that most americans do not havediplomatic immunity so it creates what the cis describes as a super citizen just like their parents most are immune to the criminal jurisdiction of the united states creating super citizens these super citizens are of course children of diplomats and all they need to have is a unitedstates birth certificate and a social security number and theyre effectively american citizens who is going to challenge it theres no question on the birth certificate that asks the question are you a diplomat is one of your parents legal an american citizen perhaps those questions dont get asked they just routinely stamp those birth certificates and send those children off with automatic citizenship 340 000 to 750 000 times a yearsome who are clearly not subject to the jurisdiction thereof in fact in the concluding statement in the article youve got a statement here from one of the proponents of the policy that i advocate a statement that says despite congress clear intent to not create a completely universal and automatic birthright citizenship policy the current application of the citizenship clause is so lax that the united states has a de facto universal birthright citizenship policy that denies unitedstates citizenship by birth to no one including children born to foreign diplomats that has to change we intend to change that with the birthright citizenship act of 2011thats h r 140and i intend to be engaged in that and to be helping to move that legislation forward it has gotten to the point where the children of diplomats with diplomatic immunity are getting automatic american citizenship just because theyre born inside the territory of the united statesperhaps not even born on unitedstates soil they might even potentially be born in that sovereign territory of the embassy itself and theyre still american citizens then we also have an outofcontrol legal immigration system aside from the illegal immigration which i talk about quite a lot if we look back over the last decade well see that we brought in roughly one and a quarter legal immigrants a year over that last decade if you would look at the new jobs created by the united states economy those new jobs created are going to average about one and a quarter million jobs a year this is before the recession began these numbers held up then and theyre even stronger now the new jobs created by the american economy have been almost exactly the same number of jobs that would be taken by the legal immigrants who come into the united states if we had shut down slowed down the legal immigration in the united states over the last 10 years there would have been just say roughly 10 million fewer legal immigrants in america and wed have 10 million fewer unemployed americans thats just a simple way of looking at this i dont propose that we eliminate all legal immigration not by any means what i do propose is that we do an economic analysis of this when we look at real numbers of testimony that have come before the committee under oath data here is what we have a country should establish an immigration policy that is designed to enhance the economic the social and the cultural wellbeing of the united states of america that should be our task yet with our legal immigration that legal immigration that is based upon merit when we take a look at what these individuals have to offer the united states when we take a look at what they have for capital to invest or their ability to assimilate or their educational background or their relative youth so theyve got some years to contribute before they start to draw from the system these are all logical things that we should ask for but its only between 7 and 11 percent of the legal immigration in american that is based upon anything that has to do with whats good for america and the balance of it would be 89 to 93 percent of the legal immigration in america is out of the control of the value judgment of the american people in the hands of the legal immigrantsor sometimes the illegal immigrantsthemselves its out of our control birthright citizenship is a piece of that that im not even sure is part of this equation that ive just described to you there is a family reunification plan that takes up a big chunk of this that once someone comes in they can start bringing in their family and their extended family and it goes out like a tree to no end we need to limit that family reunification plan and we need to roll this thing back around and base the legal immigration in america on merit againwhat do they have to offer the united states and i will say also we had testimony before the committee and there were a number of strong faithful representatives that testified there some of them are national leaders in the faith community who argued that we need to find a way to accommodate the 11 million to 20 million illegals that are here in america and give them a path to citizenship and every one of them said that they thought they should go to the back of the line they should go to the back of the line the 11 million to 20 million illegals in america should go to the back of the line but we should give them a means by which they can earn american citizenship well think about it go to the back of the line which line i asked them which line well the back of the line now thats a talking point that apparently wasnt thought about any deeper than that because if they cant answer the question which line they surely dont know where that line is is it in the united states or is it in lines in the foreign countries people waiting to come into the united states i would submit that if those who are in the united states illegally are to go to the back of the line its not a line in the united states the people in line to come into the united states legally are by definition not in the united states theyre outside the united states theyre in their home country theyre following the laws of america theyre lined up to come in the right waygod bless them for doing that but that line that line of legal waiteesto maybe coin a phrasethe line of people who are willing to respect american immigration law get in line and wait in line isnt just some short little old line that you can put 11 million to 20 million people behind and think youre going to process them through that line of the people who are respecting american laws and are waiting to come into the united states legally none of them are in the united states its 50 million strong 50 million people have taken the trouble to line up to try to come into the united states legally we are the most generous country in the world by far letting in around 1 25 million legal immigrantsa very small percentage of them actually come here because of merit as i saidand meanwhile weve got 11 million to 20 million here in this country that have disrespected our laws and i would suggest that i would much rather see the 11 million to 20 million who are in the line respecting american laws waiting to come in i would like to see them come in and become american citizens ahead of those who have disrespected american laws that sustains the rule of law that upholds the rule of law that strengthens us as a nation and rewarding law breakers weakens the rule of law and weakens us as a nation and chisels away at that beautiful marble pillar of american exceptionalism called the rule of law thats the equation and i hear constantly arguments from people that have their own interests their own viewpoint they need somebody to milk the cows or they need somebody to take care of their equestrian herd or they need somebody to do their gardening they need somebody to be their butler or their maid so theyre saying i cant afford to hire somebody in this country you need to bring me some cheaper labor i would suggest that robert rector of the heritage foundation is right we have become a welfare state and a household headed by a high school dropout without regard to their immigration status costs the taxpayer annually 23 449 a year but it boils down to this they will draw down 32 000 a year in benefitsa welfare statethey will pay 9 000 a year in taxes and thats the change thats the difference and when you multiply it times 50 years of managing the household being the head of the household 50 years it costs the taxpayers an average of 1 5 million to subsidize that household and thats a high school dropout now it may not get worse when theyre an illegal high school dropout but it doesnt get a lot better there is a net number too that he produces i think thats around the order of 19 499 a year in this area lets say 20 000 a year plus or minus a thousand or two for a household headed by a high school dropout and or an illegal immigrant now the burden to the taxpayer because were a welfare state cant be ignored and the weight on the taxpayers when we have an oversupply of cheap labor and an undersupply of taxpayers and 47 percent of households dont pay income tax were living in a welfare state and were giving automatic citizenship to 340 000 to 750 000 babies a year that are born to an illegal mother who sneaks into the united states and then the president has the temerity to go down to the border in el paso and make fun of people who think like i do that say lets build a fence a wall and a fence he said some will want a moat some will want alligators in it he was standing down there within 220 yards of this this is el paso texas this is juarez mexico some people would want a moat some people would want a fence some would want alligators in iti dont think there are any alligators in here but this is the aerial picture that i had seen just a few weeks before the president gave this speech in el paso the records are goodnot many people are getting across the border here why because we haveheres a fence right here this is the rio grande river we have a fence a river another fencehere is a patrol road that is patrolled by the border patrol there is a border patrol vehicle right here another one up around the curvea patrol road then another fence then a canal thats forwarding a lot of water and it flows pretty fast then another fence if you can get over that youre in the united states into el paso and maybe you can catch a ride here and youre home free not a moat not a moat with alligators you might say two moats and four fencesa fence the rio grande river a fence a patrol road a fence a canal with flowing waterand deepanother fence and then youre off into the united states three of those fences you have to climb wet this is very effective and the president is standing within 220 yards of that making fun of americans who think that physical structures help control illegal immigration so were spending 12 billion a year on this southern border enforcing it and chasing people across the desert 100 miles into the united states and out of that 12 billion a year thats 6 million a mile on average for every mile on our southern border i can build you a fence a wall and a fence for about 2 million a mile about onethird of the annual budget and i dont suggest that we build 2 000 miles of it right away i suggest that we start building it and stop building when they stop going around the end thats the scenario thats the logical way to address this build a fence a wall and a fence use the funding that we have roll it into that kind of infrastructure it is effective and the presidents staff didnt serve him very well if he was standing with his back to a fence a river a fence a patrol road another fence a canal and another fence those are the barriers to get into the united states and hes making fun of it and the border patrol is telling us this is effective it is effective its been effective in el paso it keeps them in juarez its been effective in san luis in southwest arizona its not effective where there is nothing and we have to pay a lot of people a lot of time and money to chase all over the desert after people that walked around the end lets build it until they stop going around the end lets pass the birthright citizenship act of 2011 lets make sure that the kind of security that is in el paso can be applied in other hightraffic areas build a fence until they stop going around the end and then we can also pass my new idea act which shuts off the federal deductibility for wages and benefits paid to illegals brings the irs into this mix and gives the employer safe harbor all of that simple solutions to a complex problem i would conclude with that statement thank you for your attention and i yield

compromise while we come to a longterm agreement thats what this is all about the other takeaway is the majority party did not allow a vote on the senate plan for all the talk about how flawed they believe the senate plan to be they didnt allow a vote on the senate plan because they would have lost their position that bill would have passed we would be done with it today so when you hear members of the majority talking about how flawed the senate bill is and how the american people dont support it their own members would have voted for it and we would have passed the bill if they would have
