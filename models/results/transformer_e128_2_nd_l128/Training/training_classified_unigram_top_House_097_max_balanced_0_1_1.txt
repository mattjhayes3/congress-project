disaster in the huge increase in the defense program requested by president reagan on thebasis of interviews with leading economists mr kaiser points out that if congress enacts this enormous defense program as seems likely and if the national economy fails to perform as well as the idminw4 ration predicts what is supposed to be a balanced budgetin 1984 could~ be a 100 billion deficit he also points out that every major economic forecasting firm as well as the congressional budget office says that the promised reagan boom will not materialize the article notes that the reagan administration proposes to increase defense spending in the next 3 years by an amount greater than the entire defense budget of 1978 further in constant dollars this buildup will be three times larger than the vietnam buildup which was the strain on our economy that provoked americas current inflation mr kaisers article mentions that the congressional budget office believes that the administration underestimates the rate at which the prices of defenserelated products are rising the congressional budget office estimates that to complete the programs in the reagan budget could cost 50 billion more in 1984 than the administration expects in general prices for military goods according to the article are rising 50 percent faster than the underlying rate of inflation our distinguished colleague les aspnq has recently brought out a study showing the tremendous economic disadvantage that the united states suffers in competition with japan and western europe because of the fact that the united states spends a far greater proportion of its gnp on military programs than japan and most of the western european countries the robert kaiser article quotes economist lester c thurow of mit who points out that one of the reasons for this is that american defense industries draw off the best engineers and skilled labor professor thurow is quoted as saying if the skilled personnel and funds that are used for defense here are used for civilian production abroad it should not come as a great surprise when we are driven out of the civilian markets what happens to us if we are driven out of semiconductors microprocessors and computers while we are busy rearming ourselves before the congress makes the longrange commitment to costly new military programs that is implicit in the reagan budget we had better do a cost benefit analysis of these programs a bankrupt america or one racked by mounting social unrest from civilian budget cuts is not likely to be a very impressive

devastating toll it is taking on small business the subcommittee invited leading experts from the academic business and bankruptcy worlds to testify to find out why so many businesses are failing and what it means for our economy the hearings were held against the backdrop of the gravest crisis faced by american business since the great depression this is what we see capital investment by companies is off sharply data resources inc forecasts that business investment will be off 8 percent this year over last year despite the massive tax incentives to invest enacted last year aftertax profits of corporations in the first quarter of 1982 were almost onethird lower than a year earlier the sharpest drop in the postwar period the new york times reported earlier this week that corporate profits have reached the lowest levels in perhaps 5 years many companies are saddled with heavy shortterm debt the ratio of shortterm debt to total debt is at a new high business balance sheets and corporate liquidity are more fragile than at any other time in postwar history since the first quarter of 1981 industrial output has dropped more than 7 percent our nations factories ran at a dismal 69 8 percent of capacity in june of this year 15 percentage points below the rate at which capital goods makers start getting orders for equipment to add capacity small business proprietorship income is expected to be nearly 15 percent lower this year than in 1980 according to data resources inc and businesses are failing at a rate not seen since the great depression todays figures as reported by dun bradstreet the business information concern are truly alarming the failure rate today is almost 90 per 10 000 listed companies just short of the failure rate of 100 per 10 000 companies recorded in the great depression year of 1933 put another way 11 businesses are failing right now for every hour of the business day business failures have only become a serious problem since 1981 looking back over the postwar period we find that business failures ranged between 1946 and 1980 from a low of 5 per 10 000 listed companies in 1946 to a high of 64 per 10 000 in 1961 the business failure rate average for those 35 years was 40 3 per 10 000 listed companies beginning in 1981 however business failures began to shoot up in 1980 l11742 companies or 42 per 10 000 companies failed in 1981 the figures jumped to 16 800 or 62 per 10 000 companies for 1982 the prediction is 25 000 or 88 per 10 000 listed companies the average for 1981 and the first half of 1982 is 75 per 10 000 companies an 86 percent increase over the 194680 average in the past 2 years the business failure rate has jumped 110 percent the second largest 2year jump since 1920 the only time it was higher was in the 2 years immediately after world war ii when business failures returned from the depressed war level to normal todays figures are indeed grim we should remember that the dun bradstreet figures cover only failures which involve losses to creditcs the number of business failures today is really much higher since thousands of businessmen simply decide to close their businesses because they see only an unprofitable future these business closings which are really failures reflect a lack of confidence in the business environment and are not reflected in dun bradstreets statistics as president reagans recently released report on the state of small business tells us the dun bradstreet figures are a valuable indicator of business distress the hearings looked at this distress not only in numerical terms but in human terms what we are seeing today is a great human tragedy we must not forget that business failures mean lost jobs ruined lives and dashed dreams they mean lost pensions lost life savings and lost tax revenues they also take a human toll in the lost selfesteem felt by those directly affected they mean an end to the american dream of opportunity and owning ones own business that has been such a powerful art of this nations dynamism last march when it was becoming clear that 1982 would see a record number of business failures i wrote to 2 dozen unitedstates bankruptcy judges and trustees to find out why this was happening i wanted to hear directly from them because they are seeing every day what is happening why it is happening and what needs to be done to end this terrible spiral of failure i received 19 replies from throughout the nation which i included in the hearing record this is the picture that emerged from the letter business are failing in all sections of the country and in every economic sector large and small businesses and young and old businesses are failing business are failing in record numbers and the failure rate continues to rise the business failures experienced today are much worse than those experienced during the last severe recession of 19741975 business are failing today because of high interest rates and the deep recession the revised federal bankruptcy code is not a cause of the increased number of business bankruptcy filings let me read a few of the responses unitedstates bankruptcy judge peter m elliott of los angeles wrote i would say that the major cause of small business failures is high interest rates unitedstates trustee william p westphal sr of minneapolis wrote the two primary causes for the increase in bankruptcies generally as well as for small business in particular are the extremely high interest rates and the length of the current recession unitedstates trustee scott h bush of dallas wrote the tentacles of the current recession reach to all communities at all locations even the glorious sunbelt has not been insulated the current recession is much more severe than the 19741975 recession unitedstates bankruptcy judge charles b mccormick of chicago wrote the increase in small business bankruptcy filings must i feel be blamed on the common elements of high interest tight money inflation the loss of jobs due to plant closings and the farming out of work to foreign countries and the other ills that greet one in the media every day unitedstates bankruptcy judge william l norton jr of atlanta wrote i do not see incompetency or mismanagement or dishonest actions in individuals or businessmen which some credit grantors or others ascribe to debtors in the bankruptcy court as being the cause of prevalence in bankruptcies i see the overwhelming number of individual and business debtors in this court who sincerely and honestly want to pay their debts and have been and are attempting to pay such debts i see many businesses and persons in my court who i feel there but for the grace of god go i as the letters i received show high interest rates and the prolonged and deep recession are placing an extraordinarily heavy burden on all businesses and small budinesses in particular this is the same message we heard from our academic witness at the hearing according to edward i altman a professor of finance at new york university and a leading expert on predicting business failures the devastating effects of reduced profits and high interest rates that have remained around 20 percent or more for several years are continuing to reduce the ranks of our smaller firm population because of high interest rates pro fessor altman continued businesses today pay more than 40 cents of each dollar of cash flow for interest charges up from 20 cents of 4 years ago no wonder so many marginal firms are succumbing to the economic reality of bankruptcy he said this is unfair small business relies almost exclusively on banks for financing they cannot shop around or bargain for the best interest rates as can large corporations many small businesses are paying at least prime rate or above prime for their loans that means close to 20 percent interest what makes these rates even more crushing is that the real interest rate is at least 10 percent the highest in recent memory the impact can be seen everywhere joseph w duncan the chief statistician for dun bradstreet presented to the subcommittee his firms latest business failure figures they showed continuing and sharp increases throughout the nation and in all industries the sun belt and mountain states are as hard hit as the farm states midwest and midatlantic region the failures touch not only the weak manufacturing wholesale retail and construction sectors but also the previously strong service industries what does the future hold only more grim numbers and more tragedy the subcommittee was tdid unless the economy improves and interest rates decline significantly i am afraid that the already staggering number of business failures will swell to levels comparable to the early 1930s the normally cautious professor altman predicted in 1932 the nadir of the great depression 31 822 businesses failed for a catastrophic failure rate of 154 per 10 000 listed companies the risk he added is that increased business failures will lead banks to tighten credit further and thus accelerate the business failure spiral if banks ration credit to only the most creditworthy firms professor altman said the marginal firm will stand little chance of surviving it is also probably true that the marginal firm is oftentimes also a small firm todays problem goes beyond high interest rates the problem stems from the mix of economic and fiscal policies currently being followed that have driven our nations economy into the worse recession since world war ii and created the severest liquidity crisis for business since the great depression as professor altman warned the real risk is not whether the economy will turn around and stage a recovery but how long the recovery will last if the turnaround is relatively short like the one we experienced in late 1980 then thousands of firms particularly smaller ones will not have sufficient time to get back on a positive cash flow basis the consequences are obvious and ominous we will see a ripple effect throughout the economy as failing large companies topple small firms doing business with them thousands of people will lose their jobs this is happening right now unitedstates trustee james eichstaedt of los angeles told the subcommittee that the bankruptcy last april of the wickes cos the large retail chain has cost several thousands jobs and seriously squeezed the small firms that did business with wickes with so many large unitedstates companies in such desperate financial straits we can count on it happening again and again and again if new economic and fiscal policies are not adopted that will bring interest rates down to affordable and stable levels and encourage the economy to grow e"], [0.002070307731628418, 0.9979296922683716,

our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure and may someday this country be blessed with another leader as bold as caring as great and as determined as he was

bringing this legislation to the floor there is no question that without his able advice and counsel we would not be here today and the george washington half would be but a dream we are all aware of george washington and of the many things that he did to shape our republic in its early days however we tend to view him more as a marble statue to be honored than for what he was a very human person who did his best in trying circumstances and created a republic that is still the hope for freedom of much of the world today it is my hope that the issuance of a commemorative coin for his 250th birthday will cause people to think about his life as that of a man who lived rather than just as a historical subject h r 3484 provides for the striking of a special silver dollar by the mint to honor this important anniversary the coins when issued next year will have a composition of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper identical to the silver coins struck in this country before 1965 they will be available for 2 years 1982 and 1983 and will be legal tender for half a dollar although they will be sold for more than that h r 3484 provides that a maximum of 10 million of these coins will be struck with the actual number issued being limited to those ordered during 1982 the number 10 million is admittedly arbitrary but was chosen as the number most likely to approximate the actual demand for the coin at its maximum demand for the eisenhower silver dollar ran at close to 7 million and while i believe that the washington half will attract more interest i believe that 10 million is a fair estimate in addition i felt that the mint should have some way to plan its production and that a ceiling would probably heighten the interest in the coin and encourage early orders my legislation provides that the price will cover all costs associated with the coin plus a profit of up to 20 percent the sales will be handled according to regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury and all profits will go into the treasury general fund briefly there are three reasons why h r 3484 should be approved first a commemorative half dollar is a fitting way to honor the 250th birthday of george washington second there is a market for the coin and it will provide an american alternative for the millions of collectors and investors who invest in silver coins yearly and are now limited to foreign coins as sqch it will help our balance of trade to some extent third the sales of these coins will provide a profit to the treasury that will help to reduce the deficit in fiscal year 1982 of these three reasons the first the desire to commemorate george washington on his 250th birthday is the most important in honor of this anniversary a silver coin is particularly appropriate as washington took a special interest in the establishment of our nations first mint and was responsible for our first silver coinage personally the establishment of a mint was one of washingtons main priorities when he became president in 1789 but circumstances delayed it for over 2 years in a speech to congress on september 25 1791 he again urged the establishment of a mint to remove the scarcity of small change a scarcity which is so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes the congress responded to this plea and not only established a mint but also provided for a national coinage system washington took a personal interest in the establishment of this coinage system and intervened when the senate bill provided for the pieture of the current president on the coins instead he successfully urged that a representation of liberty be placed on the coins the next year 1792 he used 100 of his personal silver plate for the minting of the first unitedstates coins silver 5cent pieces according to old mint documents he had not forgotten his concern about the need of the poor for coins and the coins were promptly released into circulation as shown by the heavy wear that most of them exhibit today the coin that you are considering today will not be the first time that congress has decided that a coin is an appropriate way to commemorate an anniversary of george washingtons birth fifty years ago for the 200th anniversary in 1932 a special commemorative quarter was issued supposedly for 1 year only however it proved to be so popular that it remains in circulation today the second reason for passing this legislation is that not only is there a market for the coin domestically but it will also be the first and only american entry in the worldwide silver commemorative coin market although silver coins have not been struck for circulation in recent years many nations sell them at a premium to collectors and investors and make a profit on them one excellent example is the royal canadian mint which this year will offer a commemorative silver dollar honoring the construction of a transcontinental railroad across canada this coin is part of a regular series that canada issues yearly for sale to collectors with a new design each year the coin will be offered to americans in two finishes for either 18 or 14 depending on which is chosen their efforts to attract large numbers of american buyers are shown by the many ads for the coins that have appeared in major american papers including the new york times and the wall street journal the canadians are not the only ones taking advantage of the market the april 29 issue of coin world a major hobby paper lists new silver issues aimed at collectors and investors from austria egypt gibraltar israel poland sudan switzerland and venezuela in addition it displays a prominent ad from the soviet bank for foreign trade offering that nations silver and gold medals for sale silver coins are issued internationally for a variety of reasons the silver institute states in its april newsletter that many nations issued coins for the international year of the child in 1980 and that up to 24 nations will issue them this year to commemorate the international year of the disabled person modern silver coins are sold in the millions each year many of them to american collectors and investors the profits from their sale then goes abroad to the issuing government and helps their balance of trade while at the same time hurting ours american competition would not drive the others out of the market but it would have a wide appeal with the millions of american collectors and investors in addition it would attract some foreign business and would give all the option of buying an american coin nor is the tradition of commemorative coins foreign to this country beginning in 1892 this country issued commemorative silver halfs on 48 separate occasions gold commemoratives on 6 occasions and silver dollars and quarters once each in addition there was a 40percent silver set of coins commemorating the bicentennial the profits that this coin will provide to the treasury are the third reason to support h r 3133 as written the bill directs the treasury to price the coin so that all costs associated with the production and sale of the coin are covered along with a profit to the government of up to 20 percent of the total the exact percentage was left to the treasury so that the coin could be priced at the nearest quarter dollar or so as i mentioned earlier the profits will go to the general fund of the treasury and will help to reduce the deficit for fiscal year 1982 i cannot closely estimate how large these profits will be but if silver stays at about 11 an ounce it could equal up to 15 million if the entire issue is sold while the details of the sale are left to the secretary i would hope that the coin will be promoted through the media and through other outlets such as the mint mailing list in addition if possible i would like to see volume discounts similar to those offered at one time on bicentennial sets given to financial institutions and others to encourage them to offer the coin to their customers at the original issue price if these steps or similar ones are taken i believe that the entire issue would be sold out in conclusion i believe that this coin will provide a fitting memorial to our first president while at the same time offering an american alternative to those who choose to buy silver coins this is no susan b anthony dollar but rather a profitable venture into a proven market utilizing the mints almost 200 years of expertise ameri can coins are traditionally known for their technical excellence and enjoy a wide popularity in the world now an american silver half dollar will meet the same acceptance this will be a popular coin and will be accepted by the american people as a collectors item that honors a great american h r

speech in denver that those of us who have had economic concerns from the beginning about this plan are chicken littles afraid that the sky is falling the message the president ought to understand is that what we areworried about is not that the sky is falling but that the debt ceiling is rising it is the deficit that is caused by a 1 0 trillion military arms buildup coupled with a 750 billion outlay in tax cuts that are indexed against inflation for all time as long as that deficit is there as long as there is this gap between budget cuts and tax cuts the deficit is going to be there the market is going to respond in precisely the way it is september 23 1 981 and frankly it is fraudulent economic advice for any political figure to suggest to any investor in this country that he should invest in any other way than the market is investing today based on the economic plan that has been laid down on this country i just want to add another thought on this question it is clear to me that all the sermons we have heard for years that we need to get the budget in balance have been forgotten and rejected by the highest economic priests of this administration the american people have come to realize that we cannot have extremely expensive outlays for military spending or domestic spending if we do not have the money in the till to pay for it i think that the people understand if the town meetings i have conducted across my district are any indicatorand i think they arethat before we cut taxes in massive ways we ought to get the budget in balance first the people are not naive the people when they get a tax cut want real dollars not deficit dollars it seems to me that the administration ought to understand this and i hope the president when he makes his address to the country tomorrow night will come clean with the american people and admit that there is this flaw in his economic plan and will admit that just as in the case of lbj when we tried to have guns and butter in the 1960s which really caused the massive dose of inflation that we are still trying to cope with today that this economic plan is inflationary just as guns and butter in those days was economically unsound guns and butter today will be equally inflationary the members might ask well what do you mean guns and butter today well there is butter there it may not be there for the poor man that is the difference between the great society and what we have today the butter is not for the poor the butter is there for the people who are far better off than the poor ever thought of being or ever will hope to be under current social policies the administrations guns and butter approach calls for a 1 6 trillion arms buildup no salt treaty no real commitment to negotiating an end to strategic arms production but rather ain unrestrained arms race and at the same time passing out the butter in massive tax cuts in the thought that somehow that is going to provide a sound prescription for the

to benefit the nation or its economy but rather a lot of pandering that in the long run proves to be harmful to our future this was the case recently on a vote regarding a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of congress that funding appropriated for title v of the older americans act the senior community service employment project should be maintained in future years at the level necessary to insure that its current jobs and other services be maintained or expanded on the surface this resolution sounded magnanimous and full of compassion for our fine elderly citizens as could have been expected it passed by an overwhelming margin in the house i voted against it for several reasons first i do not dispute the intrinsic worth of a senior community service program i am well aware that our older citizens have much to offer their communities and nation and that too often they are shunted aside by the now generation my concern centers around which segment of government should finance such a program with a budget deficit of more than 100 billion this year it should be obvious that the federal government does not have the money i have absolutely no objection to programs of this nature and local and state governments and perhaps private enterprise might wish to consider maintaining and expanding this program state and local governments generally have to operate within balanced budgets lack the massive moneyabsorbing bureaucracy of the federal government and allow local people to have more control over their own programs second it is pure hypocrisy for congress to decry massive budget deficits and overspending by the federal government and to sponsor balanced budget amendmentswhile at the same time playing to the grandstand with proposals that add to the federal deficit third it is wildly inaccurate to claim that federal progrpms pay for themselves and do not end up costing the taxpayers if overspending by the federal government paid for itself as is claimed for virtually every domestic program contained within the budget we would not have 100 billion deficits or trillion dollar national debts today fourth such resolutions are in themselves meaningless because congress will either appropriate the funds or it will not therefore one must assume that the purpose of such proposals is simply another liberal ploy to encourage partisan and philosophical demagoguery prior to the november general elections liberalsand many conservatives are quite aware that they will be painted as ogres haters of the elderly and uncompassionate individuals if they vote against such grand sounding proposals fifth spending on the federal level for this and similar programs actually worsens the lot of those it is designed ostensibly to help federal overspending robs the elderly and forces their backs against the wall by creating inflation inflation destroys the purchasing power of the elderly more than any other group because so many are dependent on fixed incomes so while the seen hand of federal largesse may have the public relations image of helping the elderly the unseen hand of federal deficits debt and inflation soon destroys any positive effects that earlier help may have had sixth such resolutions actually make prostitutes of many politicians becaue they in effect sell their votes for the programs in return for the votes of specific groups on election day in other words the unspoken agreement is that the various lobbing groups will urge their member to vote for congressman x because he voted for the program pushed by that lobbying group the problem is that the money of current taxpayersand future taxpayers considering the national debtis being used to buy the votes finally this process and the lack of courage on the part of many politicians are the reasons why our nation is in such an awful economic mess today we must realize the federal government cannot give something to anyone or any group that it has not first taken away from someone else this is especially true where deficit spending is concerned because it obligates money from future taxpayers with our national defenses desperately in need of rapid rebuildingit has been postponed for more than a decade due to committments for social spendingand our economy in dire straits the amerian people deserve more than

and what we agree on and what we do not agree on i think it is pretty clear if you listen to the people who have spoken here today and i predict it will be true for those who speak here tomorrow and during the debate on the amendments that we all agree that something has got to be done about the deficit something has got to be done to reduce the amount of national income being absorbed by government something has go to be done to reduce interest rates by reducing the amount of money that the federal government borrows but i also assert that when you get beyond that basic agreement fundamental differences that divide this house and divide this country become very clear in the major budget substitutes that will be voted on next week there are clear differences as to how we achieve those goals i would like very briefly to take the budget which was reported by the house budget committee and compare it to the bipartisan recovery budget which will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of the republicans and the conservative democrats who seek to control the deficit by controling spending i would like also to compare based on tentative data the budget that will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of himself and conservative democrats to the socalled coalition budget which will be offered by the gentleman from wisconsin i think when you look at these comparisons you will see very clearly what the choices are before the house if you take the data contained in the vehicle reported by the house budget committee you can break the basic policy changes into five different areas what we do about nondefense discretionary what we do about targeted entitlements what we do about other spending reductions what we do about defense and what we do about taxes we are going to hear a lot of discussion in this budget debate about economic assumptions as we did in the last but what is relevant is not what we assume about the world but what we do about the realitics that we face i think in looking at what we do in these five functional categories you will clearly see the difference in the area of nondefense discretionary the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 72 percent more than the jones house budget committee vehicle over the period 1983 to 1985 in the area of targeted entitlements the only section other than revenues that will be reconciled that committees will be forced to make changes in under the reconciliation process the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 139 percent more than the jones house budget committee budget over the 3year period in the area of other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget reduces other spending 489 percent more than the house budget committee in the area of defense the jones house budget committee budget cuts defense 69 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the jones house budget committee budget raises taxes by 55 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget and in the end achieves the same bottom line basically these differences are repeated when you compare the aspin coalition budget and the bipartisan recovery budget that will be offered here if we look at nondefense discretionary and other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 62 percent more than the aspin coalition budget over the 3 years that the budget is in force in targeted entitlements the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 119 percent more than the aspin coalition substitute in defense excluding pay the aspin coalition budget cuts defense 83 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the aspin coalition budget raises taxes by 42 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget over 3 years o 1640 my point in making these comparisons is this the house next week is going to have to choose between two real options one option is embodied in the budget presented by the house budget committee and slightly modified in the coalition aspin substitute that option says let us raise taxes and slash defense so that we can continue spending as usual in washington the real alternative is the bipartisan recovery budget which says let us focus our attention on spend ing so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and so that we can let the american people keep more of what they earn those are the options that we must choose between do we want to raise taxes and slash de fense to continue spending or do we want to control spending so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and let the american people keep more money in their pockets to provide positive incentive for people to work save and invest those who have talked about how much trouble the economy is in would have ns deal with those economic problems be raising taxes and by increasing spendng i believe that those are the policies that brought us to this sorry state and i do not believe that going back to the policies of the 1960s and 1970s will solve our problems i think it is important that we pass a budget that gains control of spending and gains control of the deficit that puts strong downward pressure on interest rates but i think the focus has got to be on the problem and the problem is spending taxes were doubled over the last 6 years and yet the deficit grew every year our problem is not inadequate taxes our problem is excessive spending in the bipartisan recovery budget we have an opportunity to do something about that excessive spending so i hope that we will have a good debate in which everyone will look at the issues what do we do about domestic nondefense spending what do we do about meeting the legitimate defense needs of our nation how much burden do we place on the shoulders of the working men and women in america in those three areas the differences among these budgets will be very clear i would like to make one additional point and that is that we have heard and we will hear a lot of talk about equity are cuts fair do we treat entitlement and discretionary programs fairly in terms of choosing where to make reductions but i would submit to my colleagues that there is another issue of fairness and that issue has to do with taxes how much burden are we going to put on those who are pulling the wagon as well as the burden that we are going to put on those who are riding in the wagon and in the ultimate fairness test by controlling the growth of taxes and focusing revenue increases on reducing the deficit rather than increasing taxes to go on spending i believe the ultimate fairness issue is going to be settled on the side of the bipartisan recovery budget may 2l 1982 so i look forward to the debate and i believe when the american people look at the three choices when our colleagues look at these three areas of difference in defense in nondefense domestic

this country it is not pleasant to talk about these things but they ought to be laid on the table the fact is that this country is in trouble economically it is in trouble for a lot of reasons inflation gone wild for a decade and a half the fact that we are yet hostage to the opec nations when it comes to energy the fact that the tax burden has continued to rise on american working men and women the fact that political demagoguery politics continues to be the no 1 subject even in e onomic questions the fact is at this point in our history we are spending our tomorrows today and that spending has not yielded a brighter today it has only dimmed our future the problem in this budget as in all others is federal spending and one of the most remarkable things about the bipartisan recovery budget is that for the first time in a while in an equitable manner it approaches the big spending items in the budget in a fair manner and reduces the rate of growth not spending at all the biggest element in this budget is entitlements some 46 percent of the prospective 1983 budget is the entitlement program some 356 billion this budget described as drastic by some cuts less than 7 billion from 356 billion after tightening entitlements listen to this role in 1983 food stamps will be up 300 million over 1982 after the minimal tightening here in 1983 ssi spending will be up 500 million over 1982 after minimal tightening here medicaid spending will be up 550 million in 1983 after minimal tightening here medicare spending will be up nearly 4 billion in 1983 over 1982 compare that to the alternatives first the presidents budget that he came out with in january and february which budget to many conservative democrats was totally unacceptable both in terms of adequacy it under estimated the deficit and did little to deal with it in terms of accuracy the figures there were not justifiable in truth and finally in terms of equity it asks cuts from some but left sacred cows like the eximbank and foreign id not untouched but growing compare the bipartisan recovery budget with the jones or the coalition the jones freeze in discretionary spending looks like a thaw look at the figures we managed to save double the money and allow spending to increase slightly in 1983 look at taxes if members would the people who pay for this budget are not in this room look at our tax reports the people who pay for this budget are working in this country and frankly the jones and the coalition budget raises up to 50 percent more in taxes in the first year alone finally when we compare these budgets ask which one does in a fair manner for this country what must be done it is spending that is out of control and the wonder is not that interest rates are high the wonder is that they are not higher the wonder is not that the people of this country have allowed us to increase their taxes for 20 years in a row and increase spending the wonder is that they have the patience that

thing to do in 1972 was to go along with nixon and john simply could not do that which was a measure for me of the seriousness of purpose and i think it was almost prescience maybe that john saw something in that particular presidency which maybe most of the rest of us simply did not i cannot help but think the last time that jean and john and i were together at a very pleasant evening in columbus at the players theater again i think the significant thing is that john as far as i could tell certainly never toward me would ever inject any ideological matters or political considerations in the interpersonal relationships it was always good to encounter him because you never hesitated to talk he was direct and accessible and always courteous certainly in my experience and i have never heard anyone suggest anything other than that for those of us who have been around central ohio for some decades now it seems as if a part of the firmament has gone but i do not really think so

the subcommittee the gentleman from illinois a question regarding construction of the hopi medical center which was part of the settlement reached in connection with the navajohopi indian relocation act amendments public law 98305 i think the distinguished chairman is aware that the legislation required the department of health and human services to assign the highest priority to construction of the hopi medical center i understand from the department that the estimated 800 000 necessary to conduct the construction planning and design of this facility through an oversight was not included in the pending 1982 budget request for indian health facilities and thus is not included in the 46 7 39 million appropriation recommended for indian health facilities on page 42 of the bill in lieu of offering an amendment to increase this amount by 800 000 i understand that it might be possible for the department of health and human services to reprogram 800 000 for preconstruction activities for the hopi medical center i would ask the distinguished gentleman from illinois chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking minority member the gentleman from pennsylvania mr mcdade whether they would look favorably on this reprograming alternative to allocate the necessary 800 000 for the hopi medical center in fiscal year 1982 and whether they would be likely to look kindly on or approve such a
