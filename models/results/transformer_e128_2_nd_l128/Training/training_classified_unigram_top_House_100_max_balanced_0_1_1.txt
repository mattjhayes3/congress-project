speaker and my colleagues and those who are watching this memorial sala burton served in this house for 3 years her husband served for close to two decades if you look at that statistic alone it does not really tell you the reality of the contributions of both phil and sala because they both served together during all those years they worked together collaborating together in the mutual objectives that they shared politically they both cared deeply about the role that government could play to help the disadvantaged the dispossessed to try to bring about social and economic justice they cared about the working people and the ability of those people to organize collectively to fight for their rights they always saw the people who were struggling who were having a tough time as the ones who needed their help most they cared about protecting the environment and they cared very deeply about this nation of ours sala burton was a refugee from poland she and her immediate family survived the nazi holocaust in europe those in the immediate family that did not come to this country were all lost in the crematoria of hitlers death camps that fact probably more than any other impressed upon sala the deep commitment to protecting civil liberties civil rights understanding that minority groups that might be discriminated against one day could be hated the next and uncontrolled discrimination and hatred can lead to such enormous evil that she knew we had to act before these kinds of things got out of hand on a personal note i have known sala and phil for close to 30 years when i was a young teenager and belonged to the young democrats in california phil and sai would talk to us when most grownup politicians were not spending any time with the kids about why politics was a noble thing to be involved in why the fights that we were fighting were often so frustrating were important and that we could make a contribution and that we had to keep on trying to make things better when my family and i came to washington the door was always open to us at the burton home 01450 i know that both when i was in sacramento and when we came here our daughter who is now 23 grew up calling sala burton aunt sala there was a very very close bond of friendship between our families on a very personal level they were always there phil and sala to give us some guidance some encouragement some reinvigoration of commitment to try to accomplish in some way the goals they set out for themselves and set as role models for us to try to emulate one of the most touching tributes at the lovely memorial service in san franscisco was given by the speaker of the state assembly another person who has gone back even longer than almost any of us who are involved in public office in his political and personal relationship with phil and sala and that was speaker willy brant he closed his very eloquent remarks by saying that the best memorial tribute to sala burton is to try to act the way saia acted to try to live up to the ideals that she not only personified but urged upon all of us if we in some way could live up to that standard we would be by that example following her example and giving the greatest memorial to her i hope that as we remember fondly the memories of sala burton and the time we have had with her over the years the time that she has been with us in this institution that we will try to live up to the standards that she set for all of us to the goals and ideals that she so strongly and firmly believed in and in that way we will indeed be giving a living memorial to all the work that she has done over the years i do want to indicate that my wife janet had the opportunity to do an interview with sala burton a couple of months ago and i will insert that interview into the record i think it speaks a lot about sala in ways that many people did not know about her particularly her remembrances of the holocaust and very strong feelings of jewish identity and the commitments to the goals and ideals of her religion"], [0.0020051002502441406, 0.9979948997497559, 1, "i ask unanimous consent that the committee on post office and civil

it seems too much to expect of a selfrespecting sovereign nation and its duly elected leaders which like it or not is the case in nicaragua today as a matter of fact we ourselves give testimony worldwide that that is a fact for we have a duly accredited plenipotentiary our unitedstates ambassador in managua testifying to that fact that he is there received as such as a duly appointed envoy of the united states recognizing the legitimacy of that regime which we so derogatorily label the sandinista regime and has been rather unjustly and inaccurately labeled as a marxistleninist complete takeover of the nicaraguan government i want the record to show that as of november 4 1984 where the people in nicaragua in a free open election in which you had half a dozen different party candidates including the communists the socialists the marxistleninists all vied for these national leadership positions i think we should know and i think the american people are entitled to know that the combined vote garnered by the socialists which were a separate entity the marxistleninists and the communists to some of us less enlightened minds it seems like it is all one big package i do not see much difference between a labeled national socialist which after all was the name of the hitlerian party adolf hilters party the german national socialist labor party mussolini was in italy and came up piggybacked on the workingmans shoulders and backs in russia we have had the united soviet socialist republics i think the feature that is indistinguishable in all these forms is the authoritarian nature the anti democratic nature of these regimes the fact that you read in history about the open slogan and proclamation that the soviet socialist cause believed in the dictatorship of the proletariat well that in itself clearly contradicts the democratic principle i for one resist any kind of any anti democratic exercise given my background the inheritance that has enabled me more than perhaps the average americanborn citizen to appreciate what we define as democracy really is and now the word democracy is used very liberally and interchangeably in all of these countries it would hardly fit the day in and day out dailylife definition that we americans give democracy anytime as i say we reduce that decisionmaking power without in the words of the declaration of independence the just consent of governed we do not have democracy we do not have participatory democracy we do have representative or republican form of government i used the word republican in the sense in its languageorigin sense not in the partylabel identification that we are accustomed to hearing in our country so that when we say that in a country such as nicaragua where because of revolution a revolution that had been ongoing before during and after our marines occupied that country for 9 years when calvin coolidge ordered the invasion of nicaragua in 1929 and remained there until the somoza regime was imposed and the military force known as the nationale guardia or the national guard was imposed in order to be able to keep the somoza regime in i might say by way of addition that that invasion in 1929 had been preceded by eight others in less than 75 years on the part of the united states as far as invading a sovereign people known as the nicaraguans with this heritage of experience and background we should keep in mind that astoundingly even under the pressure of this vast goliath which is our country through the cia attempting to kill its leaders i myself saw fragments of explosives that had been attempted to be used to blow up public buildings in nicaragua and they were clearly stamped for unitedstates army use only through the cia we have attempted to kill their leaders we have perpetrated great destruction and pillaging of nicaraguan sovereign territory and properties while all the time we have maintained an ambassador in managua so that with this as the background and with the issuance of this socalled peace movement it should be noted that what i saw as the summary of the proposalin fact it was rather explicit it was not that much of a summary it was practically the full proposal in effect my interpretation leads me to conclude that no selfrespecting leader of a sovereign nation would accept it for the plain and simple reason that mr reagan says once again except a little more politely drop dead or ill kill you this has been his approach to nicaragua since 1981 the socalled sandinista revolution triumphed in the summer of 1979 at no time during the course of that civil war was the american embassy ever attacked unlike the revolution in el salvador where we proclaimed victory because according to our leaders in and out of the congress in and out of the white house we have imposed a legitimate a very acceptable leader in jose napoleon duarte but who is no more no less in power than he was two times before when he was finally kicked out by the military and those who have murderously through their socalled escuadrons de glorius literally translated glory squads but we have learned to know as the death squad were killing off thousands of salvadorans and continue to do so even under duarte with a vengeance now there is more freedom in nicaragua which we look down upon and which the president consistently says is a country shorn of liberty than there is in el salvador right now as i am speaking which a lot of my colleagues the white house the state department proclaim as being a legitimate government because of the results of the elections 3 years ago but which were far more controlled our money financed the salvadoran elections you cannot say this was true in nicaragua you cannot say that you had on the ballot in el salvador the hostile elements that had been in rebellion there are five factions in the revolutionary core of the salvadoran revolutionary movement and in the ballots in nicaragua for instance all that the four socalled socialist marxistlenin1st party candidates could receive was a total of 6 percent of the vote that clearly should indicate that the attempt made on the part of those who have consistently attempted to destabilize as our first secretary of state under ronald reagan general haig openly said he would do for it was he who first introduced the argentinian troops into honduras in order to train what we now called the contras in order to destabilize the then sandinista junta unless we are prepared to accept the facts of history and the traditions we will continue to be duped as a public and as a congress by a leader such as ronald reagan who as president has violated every principle for which america stands he has taken our country out of the world court of justice plus we were one of the sovereign nations to help initiate decades ago because we feared the verdict of the world court in the face of the gravamen of charges that nicaragua had brought against us in the world court of justice and sure enough mr reagan pulls out i though he was for law and order but lo and behold for the first time he has pulled us out of the world court of justice but subsequent to our pulling out the world court of justice rules found us guilty convicted us and ordered compensation for what we now call acts of terrorism attempts to assassinate the leaders destruction of nicaraguan property and so at that point because i have seen at no point in no periodical not even a summary in any newspaper of the international court of justices judgment known as a judgment of the court filed on now this judgment has not even been mentioned but it has influenced world opinion there is not one country of any substance other than the eastern caribbean countries that are totally dependent on our largess who are in sympathy with the actions of our government in the last 6 yearswith respect to central america generally and nicaragua specifically there is not one european nation that sympathizes with us even in the far east there is absolutely no adherence we have become without the american people fully realizing it the laughing stock of the world but what is more shockingly arrayed as an open contradiction to everything we say we stand for as americans so that as president ronald reagan has violated very single principle thatwe have always held from the beginning as meaning and symbolizing what america is all about he has acted without consulting congress in the most calamitous of decisions and even as commander in chief he has been a faithless leader this is why for 14 months i took this floor to inquire of the president what is the military mission mr president of the marines you have detailed to lebanon they are under the daily shadow of death mr president but i also knew that the joint chiefs of staff had unanimously advised the president the commander in chief if you please against that diversion of troops now everybody throughout the world knew all one had to do was read the european press france west germany spain england the south american press and you would realize that it was incongruous it was inconsistent with what these diplomats in those countries these editors of newspapers in these countries could understand was a coherent a logical a reasonable decision so we had the calamitous slaughter of 241 of our warriors the reason being that the president as i said and recalled st paul by saying if the trumpet giveth an uncertain sound who then can prepare for battle this ronald reagan trumpet is still uncertain and contradictory in its sounds and tones even today as we are here and we are discussing this the central american issue is off the headlines but in a few weeks it will be back on because of the persian gulf contradictions even some of his staunchest supporters back in my home state of texas have written and said well i have supported him but i dont understand this its a bad decision how come you fellows in congress arent doing something it has yet to result in any input on the part of the congress has the president consulted with congressional leaders not to my knowledge so here is a president who has callously failed to consult with the congressional leaders even president lincoln at the height of the civil war would never have thought of failing to do that president franklin roosevelt before he would make any kind of a pronunciomento he had on a bipartisan basis summoned forth the leaders in the congress and advised them even lyndon johnson before he would move even in his invasion of santa domingo which i felt was questionable but nevertheless he made sure he had the approval of the oas even as he told me at one time he had to kind of pressure them a little bit but at least he paid respect to the decent opinion of mankind that is another phrase from our declaration of independence the president has ordered military strikes that kill civilians he attempts to kill foreign leaders and without constitutional authority he embarked as i say while he has his ambassador in managua military support for the socalled contras what i call the immoral equivalent of our founding fathers knowing full well that they have murdered and raped and pillaged their own fellow nationals in nicaragua so that the socalled peace initiative now is patently hypocritical on its face it depends imperiously it does not say hey let us come forth and discuss it in company with other nations which have been called the contadora nations as a matter of fact if we had wanted to follow this advice which incidentally is the only advice i have given the privileged orders consistently since april 1 1980 and ronald reagan was not president jimmy carter was the reason i did was that it was obvious that for whatever reason somewhere in that vast maze of governmental bureaucracy or governmental setup at that time under jimmy carter the state department or whoever was responsible for those decisions was beginning to embark on a course of military rather than other approaches the assassination of archbishop romero the murder and rape of five american nuns several american priests an untold number of foreign missionaries as well as reporters four scandinavians in el salvador alone all because the death squads were deadly effective at the time and even such dastardly things as the murder of archbishop romero not one time has general duarte said well you know were going to try to do something about ascertaining responsibility the reason is that these great great murderers duboson the leader of the death squads who was the one who dubbed them esquadron egloria glory squads and where over 55 000 salvadorans have died one cannot in america understand the extend of our calamitous interventions unless we are in touch with those who are themselves the reasonable minds the moderates minds but in countries such as these that after over 350 years of tyranny and exploitation the worst ever that you can read about are desperately realizing that the world does not have to be that way we have aided and abetted those who in the name of combating communism want to maintain in perpetuity their exploitation of these masses they are not going to do it we are not going to succeed we do not have enough soldiers to sicceed and we should not it is calamitous to think that we have gone so far as we have in intervening in behalf and supporting and maintaining and feeding these despots corrupt and feeding off our largess with their secret swiss accounts with their beautiful jacuzzi equipped jets based in miami how many american tax dollars have gone to that well ask mr reagan you will not get an answer because the congress itself has not even been so much as consulted much less informed since the congress is a multiple body it is very difficult to summon in quick rapid order unitary action that can countervail the unitary action of the mandatory known as the president unfortunately as in the case of the assassination of archbishop romero the cia stationed in that area were in close contact cheek by jowl with the assassination of romero there would never have been any problem about arresting and judging and trying the murderers and assassins except for the fact that our country and through the cia was in close alliance with those that in the name of anticommunism were murdering such free voices as archbishop romero we cannot stand the judgment of world opinion and certainly we are indicted by the world court of justice much less a much higher and divine judgment so i introduced an impeachment resolution on march 5 last and i gave my recital of specifics though actually they were not actually necessary to carry out a proper impeachment course on the house of representatives level but i did so because the acts were specific and each one an impeachable offense certainly a willful flouting of our constitution is one of the main reasons why the men who wrote that constitution 200 years ago delved deep into the mother countrys history in its struggle for freedom to preserve in these articles and sections in our constitution impeachment meaning if an agent of the people appointive or elective violates his oath of officeand what is that oath of office the oath of office we all take is that we shall uphold defend and preserve the constitution against all enemies both domestic as well as foreign when the american people saw this uniformed but somewhat mendacious marine colonel north in his military august 6 1987 h 7278 uniform equipped with medals bemedaled and all and heard him say that his highest allegiance was to the chief he was saying the same thing all of the ober lieutenants of the nazi armies those in the mussolini corps and those in these other countries were saying because he did not take an oath to make the supreme being the commander in chief his oath is the same as ours to uphold the constitution against all enemies domestic as well as foreign that means the president himself in the trials of nuremberg german exleader after german exleader rationalized and explained and tried to justify his decisions by saying i was carrying out orders as a faithful and dutiful officer of the wehrmacht this is what colonel north was telling us the other day i did not hear anybody even on the committee say hey wait a while mister your duty is to the constitution and that is the oath you take otherwise there is no difference between our country and what history has shown as these lesser and benighted regimes that created so much havoc and misery and pain for humanity in the 20th century so certainly we here in america must speak a great french mind who died in world war i at the battle of marne said he who knows the truth and does not proclaim it from every rooftop is in a conspiracy with liars and cheats and that is very true that french mind was charles peguy a great thinker great philosopher great literator and a soldier who died in the field of battle in a most sad way certainly the congress above all under our constitution cannot at any time fail to respond to its very prime constitutional purpose for which it was created in article i of the constitution the executive branch is article ii and the reason was as james madison said and i am going to quote of all of the evils to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops every other war is the parent of armies from the proceeds debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the know instruments for bringing the many under the domain of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all of the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare so in light of this history of this regime known as the ronald reagan administration should we wonder that the decisions which i have labeled for 3 years now as irreversible that is to intervene directly in nicaragua are not being changed one whit not one whit why do i say this when some of us were recommending 6 years ago that we try diplomacy first after all we go to war we go to battle we summon the military only when diplomacy has failed and this is why our record in postworld war iii should not say postworld war ii because my contention is world war ii is not over yet there is no peace treaty we have 300 000 of our troops in germany alone 45 000 in korea and now we do not know how many will be sailoring around in the mediterranean we have quite a number that nobody can ascertain for sure in what would be questionable activities on the part of our regularly constituted services south of the border we have had over 20 of our soldiers killed in that area alone and yet nobody identifies them as such so i doubt that president reagan being of the mind his actions clearly reveal is going to reverse an investment of 4 billion a policy of ultimate direct intervention because in this proposal an ultimatum is given either you accept this or if you do not we will proceed what do you mean by proceed well the president has said several times if not once that he hopes the congress will give him all of the funds necessary and military aid to the socalled contras in honduras which incidentally is a fundamental violation of the international law as long as we have the fully accepted and constituted plenipotentiary in managua testifying to the world that we recognize that regime i have said earlier this month and last month that the month of august this month we are in is the ideal month for operational activities in the area particularly the north and in fact most of nicaragua it is the dry weather month and it is only 1 month or so of duration that you can really count on this maximum operation i say that the die has been cast that president ronald reagan is not the kind being an ideologue that is going to change his mind that it is insulting to say that you are going to try a last minute ploy by seeming to accept a peace or diplomatic approach when five other nations every one of them a sovereign independent nation and very well respected from mexico to venezuela have for 52 years been conducting such attempts and had reached an agreement except for our undermining of that agreement our government has obstructed and undermined every single attempt to find a peaceful solution by those nations among themselves to me that is folly it is criminal folly because if at any time we can have the persuasive ability of some at least erstwhile friends and allies putting forth a condition that if accepted would mean that all of our socalled allegations and reasons for being hostile to this regime would be taken care of i have read the contadora processes and if i had thought i would have brought them with me and placed them in the record because again i have never seen them printed in any american publication all we had to do was what eisenhower did president eisenhower did not think it was demeaning to the united states in 1957 we joined the equivalent number of nations in reconciling the dispute between honduras and nicaragua wide ranged for decades and when those nations invited our secretary of state eisenhower said fine and they made the american diplomat the leader the chairman and then all went to the world court the same one mr reagan has taken us out of and there it was settled and it had remained settled until 1981 when gen alexander haig introduced argentinan troops into honduras with the determined purpose to destabilize the sandinista junta at that time so what is wrong with that approach what is wrong with finding victory by having more brains as i was told once whenl was starting out as a juvenile officer and i heard screaming in the adjacent room while i was with the then county health official who was examining some of the young juveniles due to appear in the court next day and the doctor known as dr goodson said for heavens sake see what all of that banshee screaming is so i go over and i see this woman on the floor hitting her head on the floor and screaming at the top of her lungs and this very bewildered young female caseworker that had just been hired out of college and a young girl the girl was sobbing and the woman was saying oh my daughter my daughter and i said i went over and i said lady now come on stop hitting your head on the floor tell me what is the matter she said well i know my daughter has been bad but i dont think this woman has the right to call her a whore so i said to the lady well lady you come over here and lets discuss this she subsided i went to the chief and i said hey look assign this case to somebody else i came back and dr goodson said well i can see that you have more brains than the dogs i said what to you mean by that doctor he said well i am an oldtimer and he was at that time this was 1946 he was already about 82 years old and he said way back there we used to have a farmer out here a rancher that wanted to train some dogs to retrieve point and hunt and retrieve he said and he went to the best experts and finally he went up to the east to look at some of these experts and consult them and they could not train those hounds until one day this son of a slave family was called in and they said do you think you can train them and he said well give me a chance we will see well sure enough 2 weeks later he brought the dogs they would point they would run they would retrieve and this plantation owner or rancher said row tell me what was the secret of your success this poor laborer scratched his head and he said well i guess the first requirement is that you have more brains than the dogs i believe the reason for that is that for the first time in our history we have an ideologue president narrow in scope and breadth of vision shallow in depth of understanding and knowledge and history an ideologue which he revealed completely for 30 years that he served as a spokesman for the general electric corp and went around the country making speeches his utterances during the watergate proceedings in which he clearly said i do not know what is the matter with president nixon he said after all there are times when a president must do things and must make it perfectly all right for his aides and assistants to lie if necessary this is mr ronald reagan about 1974 1975 trying to rationalize why nobody should get excited about what president nixon was supposed to be in trouble about but i think that if we have as i have painfully tried to since april 1 of 1980 and i spoke after 6 months of failing to reach some officials that would be reactive in the white house in the state department and then i took to the floor because i felt as i have felt every time i have taken the floor that that is my responsibility for if i feel that what i say is the truth and there is no rebuttal thereto and being that i feel and i think my record shows that i am honest that if i am shown to be in error i will be the first to admit it and proclaim my error and correct either my utterances or my actions but in the absence of that i hold steadfastly as i have every day in the last 342 years that the people have given me the privilege to serve in a representative capacity 3 years on the city council difficult years perhaps the most turbulent in municipal history in san antonio in the 20th century in which i faced everything from death threats people shooting from attempts to frame to scare me off the city council as the city attorney then said at a bar he said you wait in the morning we are going to scare that little mexican so bad he will wish he never heard of the city council and all they did was insure that on this day in august i would be in this great forum in the hall of the house speaking forth under great privilege of special orders as a duly elected member from the 20th district of texas which i had never in my wildest fantasy dreamed i would be doing for one i had never planned i never had the ambition never though it would be possible to be immersed in politics it took the war and wars as calamitous as they are and as evils in their train are brought nevertheless sometimes do some things that help the cause of democracy and equality and justice the war did bring down some of the barriers that some people faced before the war but who because of their patriotism and their heroism in the war clearly proved they should be and were entitled to be duly accepted into the mainstream of american life and given the greatness and the vitality and the resiliency of our institutions up to nowand the reason i speak today is that i have been the most apprehensive in the last 3 years as to the durability the resiliency of this constitutional form of government as ever before all during the time of watergate there was only one time i had equal apprehension and that was this month 1965 my gosh i cannot believe it is 22 years ago we had a resolution calling for the 25th amendment to our constitution and so many when i stood up filibustered the race bills in my first session of the state senate held the floor for 30 hours managed to kill 14 of those massive resistance bills that came out of the confederate states emanating from virginia 14 of the 16 and i would get up and i would say i am not here as a spokesman for my fellow texan who happens to be a of black descent and some of you who say well what is my political mileage i think you ought to know that in my county this great citizen does not comprise over 7v2 percent of the total population i hope none of you think as amateurish as i am that i am that dumb a politician but the thing that impels me and these are the words i used is that i am here like i would be nowhere else even in my parents country with all of the benefits of their affluence and richness would never have been able to offer the freedom the chance the opportunity the education that we six in his family received free of charge and for that i will fight to the bitter end to preserve and since i have been a recipient of these privileges i will never act in such a way i will never do such things as will diminish one iota the transmittal of this heritage to those who will follow for it i cannot enlarge the horizon then i certainly will do nothing to diminish for that i would consider the worst of treason and i sincerely feel that way that is no put on even these special orders have gotten me as much condemnation as they have approval because as in everything else nobody is going to want to kill you because you are tall and they are short or you are short and they are tall but if you think differently enough some people want to kill you i have gone through that but the beauty is that up to now i think the system is in danger more than ever because we have a dangerous personality with awesome power and unlike president nixon a charismatic personality president nixon to even his strongest supporters had some misgivings so when that 25th amendment or the resolution calling it forth came up i went to the then chairman of the committee on the judiciary the great jurist and expert manny celler of new york and i said i just saw this mr chairman at that time it was a lot easiergoing we had very few votes very little business i wondered why this was coming up and he said well because first in the senate there has been a lot of activity and this will resolve this question that we have just faced with lyndon johnson where he was president for a year without a vice president and woodrow wilson vegetated for about a year and a half or two and i said well but the ship of state survived i am troubled by this language here for instance section 4 here says that if the majority of the governing body who is that and he got real disgusted with me he said well everybody knows that is the cabinet i said but that is not constitutional language the cabinet is not a constitutional function no where do you see that word i said what do you mean he said well that is what it means i said well but it cannot be if a majority of the governing body decide that the president is incapable of functioning they shall declare him incapacitated and the vice president becomes acting president i said in the united states to our great constitution you want to do this and with that he almost threw me across the aisle so i was one of the 26 or so that voted no but i was the only one that said why but i never dreamed in my wildest nightmares that i would live to see some of those dreads become reality so there we had in 1974 alexander haig secretary of state henry kissinger coming to mr nixon and saying if you dont quit we are going to invoke the 25th amendment then you had spiro agnew who was proclaiminghe came right here to the speakers room one september day and i was here there were just a few of us he came to say that he was throwing himself on the mercy of the house and the congress because something was happening over there well what was happening over there waswell he later wrote in his book and what is the title of his book go quietly or else what do you mean or else that is what the gangsters do go quietly or else we bump you but that is what mr spiro agnew said remember him he was vice president of the united states that is the title of his book go quietly or else and he attributes that phrase to alexander haig so he did leave now the papers said he left because he was susceptible to some charges and what not and what not but that is the reason they said mr nixon left and obviously it was the reason why mr ford gave him a pardon the moment he was sworn in as president but what happened more significantly than ever in the history of our country since the first congress and the adoption of the constitution we ended up with an unelected president and two unelected vice presidents and that was because of the 25th amendment so i am asked why do you want to get up there and talk why dont you just write and submit for the record well i have been doing this since the second week i came to the congress 251 2 years ago of course then there was no tv coverage but then i always felt that the purpose of tv coverage was to allow the american people who would to view some of the proceedings whatever was worthy of being carried and that i would not divert from purpose and intent the same purpose and intent i had for speaking out for some 20 years and change that with the advent of tv coverage with one failure on my part as an exception i have always addressed the colleagues which i am doing now for the record because my remarks faithfully taken by these very competent reporters of debatesa constitution wordwill record and print for perusal by the members and those who will be on the subscription list that is who i am addressing and appealing to because i believe that as never before in the person of president reagan who as i have said and repeat has taken every action that is inimical and contrary to every basic american principle and yet is unchallenged these i believe are reasons that would impel a member charged with knowledge to formulate as i have and i didand it took me 6 months since last yearand finally on march 5 i introduced the resolution of impeachment so in a manner of speaking i guess this could be called the impeachment of ronald reagan no 9 the fact remains that that is the impelling motive now the consequences those you will always have back home it was brought forth the spiteful the revengeful outbursts of those who are fanatic supporters of the president and the other party on a partisan basis that those who are responsible for disseminating of information and its use are in that category of dogmatic fanatic supporters of the president it is no wonder that many citizens have requested that i furnish in greater detail either copies of house joint resolution 111 the impeachment resolution and whatever explanations i have given so by xeroxing the proceedings of the house in which my special orders have been printed i have been able to supply that request what it boils down to is that the tendency particularly during the advent of president reagan is to label anybody who does not agree with the approach as one who is sympathetic to communism this is so absurd all through my career i have had to face this dogmatic fanatic approach in boulder co believe it or not of all places on august 8 the day after tomorrow will be the 14th anniversaryit was 1973that i was almost killed literally because i was not radical enough just a few years before that in texas i was considered the leading radical

probably would have opposed it because of a concern i have about covert activity let me tell you now as i serve on that intelligence committee i believe that it will be a very dangerous move if my colleagues who have visited the area a couple of times automatically become instant experts because they saw and heard what it was the countries wanted them to see and hear or if they try to become assistant secretaries in charge of central america contrary to what the chairman said i happen to believe that the reason that nicaragua is participating in the contadora discussions at the present time is because of that covert activity if for no other reason or other purpose i think the covert action has been successful for that reason the real danger is if we sent publicly a signal that as a matter of fact we are going to cut the operation off why should nicaragua participate in anything why not just wait and wait us out second i am very concerned about those people who are very quick to say well let us do it in a covert manner that sounds pretty good that also in my estimation means that as a matter of fact we are going to get deeply involved in a situation that most americans do not want to get deeply involved in i do not see how there could be anything but american loss of lives if in fact we went the overt way i know a lot of people say that because apparently it suits their
