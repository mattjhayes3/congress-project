along with kendrick meek mr meek from florida and also ms wasserman schultz from florida we have been coming here now for a couple of years talking about the condition of the united states our fiscal situation our investment situation or lack of investment in the united states of america and also what we believe is the democraticf caucus and leader peloij and steny hoyer and the issues that we are trying to put forward it has been a very interesting week here for the democratic caucus we had a wonderful guest george lucas the famous writer director producer of the great star wars movies and he was here to talk about the innovation agenda that the democratiq party is beginning to put forward and we have an innovation agenda to keep america competitive in the 21st century as we look at what has been happening here in the united states this kind of breaks down into two or three separate categories one if we want to be a strong country we have got to start here at home and we got to start making the investments here in the united statep research and development education health care alternative energy technologies must start here and we must begin to grow our economy here if we are going to be of any good to anyone else here in the world unfortunately our friends across the aisle on the republican side have failed miserably in their attempt to try to balance the budget here in the united states of america we have as citizens of this country regardless of what political party you belong to we have as a country an 8 2 trillion national debt 8 2 trillion dollars each citizen in this country owes 27 000 to our national debt if a baby is born today that baby owes 27 000 to the united states government to help us pay our debt if you are a senior citizen you owe 27 000 to the united states government and if we keep going down the path that we have been on and here it is 8 2 trillion as of valentines day 2006 and your share of the national debt is 27 500 we have a real situation in the united states of america so not only do we owe this not only does each person owe that what do we do so if we are running a 400 billion annual deficit or 300 billion what do we do to fund business in the united states of america we have got to go out and borrow the money and this president in the first 4 years of his term borrowed more money from foreign interests than every single administration prior to his in the last 224 years this president borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign interests in 4 years more than every other president before him is that making america stronger mr speaker i do not think it is i think it weakens our country and here it is this president in a republican house and a republican senate has borrowed 1 05 trillion from 2001 to 2005 and all of these presidents did not borrow as much from foreign interests as this one has and that puts us that puts us at a position of weakness because guess who we are borrowing the money from to pay the bills we borrow some from unitedstates interests but this is a chart that outlines who else we are borrowing this money from 682 billion we have borrowed from japan 249 billion we have borrowed from china 67 8 billion from opec are you kidding me we are borrowing money from opec to help fund and plug the hole in our annual deficits here meanwhile they are making money hand over fist this is a very dangerous situation that we are in because here is the end result here is where the rubber meets the road as we all take out loans to pay for our homes or our cars or our kids education unfortunately you cannot just borrow the money at zero percent interest you have got to pay interest on the money you borrow so the interest on 8 2 trillion is a lot of money so what does that mean for our annual payments that we have to make just on the interest this chart is the 2007 budget in billions of dollars this big red bar that gets up to 230 billion is what we are going to pay in the 2007 budget projected on interest on the debt just the interest we are not paying it down we are just paying the interest on it and this nice lavender bar that barely gets up over 50 billion is what we are going to spend on education and then homeland security and then veterans the irresponsible policies of this administration put our fiscal house in disorder because we are spending so much money on just paying the interest on the money we owe the chinese and the japanese and the opec countries that is a great deal for those countries great deal for them but what about us a stronger america starts here at home so until we fix this problem there is no issue we can go on addressing because it straps our hands behind our back because we want to make investments in education research and development pell grants to lower the cost of college tuition put research money into figuring out an alternatie energy source so we are not dependent on some of these opec countries but check this out this is the interest on the debt that i just showed this is what we could spend every day in this country if we did not have to pay all this interest on the debt we could invest 1 million a day into every congressional district i represent a district in northeast ohio youngstown ohio akron ohio niles ohio warren ohio portage county kent state university is in my district this is an older area in the northeast of the great state of ohio the great buckeye state 365 million i could have to go back to this area and invest in the schools head start all kinds of other different things just from my district and every other member in here would get 365 million a tremendous difference give it to the chinese banks the chiinese government give it to the japanese banks the japanese government give it to opec or give it to the kids who are trying to go to school in youngstown ohio of which 80 percentlive in poverty that go to youngstown city schools i know what i would like to choose some other things here we could provide health care to 79 925 more veterans if we would not have to pay the interest on the debt like in the late 1990s when we made the very difficult decision here and i am glad the gentleman from florida is joining us for this point a very difficult decision in 1993 when president clinton got into office we were running budget deficit after budget deficit every year and our democratic house and a democratic senate with a democratic president balanced the budget in 1993 without one republican vote i am hot saying some republicans would not vote for it now but at that time when the heat was on without one republican vote and it led to balanced budgets surpluses as far as the eye could see investments into education hope scholarship the whole nine yards and the greatest 6conomic expansion in the history of this country more important the private sector because interest rates were low the private sector was able to go out and create over 20 million new jobs we cannot create jobs here in government that is not our duty that is not our responsibility this is the chart reagan reagan reagan bush bush bush all in the red and clinton in the late 1990s after the 1993 budget was im plemented we started having surpluses in the late 1990s projected out as far as the eye could see because of fiscal discipline that is what our job is here balance the budget keep interest rates low invest in the education and research like this country has always done and the private sector will join and take over some other things if we did not have to pay the interest on the debt we could enroll 60 000 kids into head start you want to talk about being compassionate you want to talk about if you practice the christian faith being a christian i think somewhere that means making sure we can invest into those poor districts those poor children and i am so glad that mr meek is joining us because we started out here and that we being me talking about the impact of the budget deficit and the fiscal situation that we are in right now and the damage that it is causing to the american economy and the lack of investment because we are paying the interest on the debt to many of these countries overseas so thank you very much fot joining us i know you were busy in a homeland security committee hearing and i appreciate you coming up to support the 30somethings"],

budget includes a deficit for 2006 of 372 billion and a deficit for 2007 of 348 billion these deficiti mean that under republican policies the five largest deficits in history will have occurred in five consecutive years over the next five years 20072011 the budget resolution calls for deficits totaling 1 1 trillion since this administration took office it has requested and the congress has provided four increases in the statutory debt ceiling totaling 3 trillion under this budget by 2011 the statutory debt will increase by another 2 3 trillion for a total increase of 5 3 trillion it will leave the statutory debt at a record level of 11 3 trillion the presidents reckless economic policies have doubled our nations debt further i am concerned by the amount of the debt that has been accumulated by foreign bank individuals and governments in 1980 17 percent of the federal debt held by the public was in foreign hands by 2006 45 percent of the debt held by the public was ovned overseas unfortunately this trend seems to be increasing rapidly during the past year approximately 90 percent of the debt we have accumulated has been purchased by foreign banks individuals and governments i support the representative john spratts alternative budget which would reach balance in 2012 the spraft budget also has smaller deficits than the republican budget and accumulates less debt by contrast the republican budget never returns to balance and even refuses to show how big its deficits will be after 2011 the spratt budget backs the twosided payasyougo paygo budget enforcement rules that require that the cost of any new mandatory spending or revenue legislation be fully offset during the 1990s twosided paygo rules played a critical role in turning record deficits to record surpluses the spratt budget also requires a separate vote to increase the debt limit and prohibits using fasttrack reconciliation procedures to make the deficit worse the republican budget cuts appropriations for domestic services by 9 4 billion relative to current services and by 3 2 billion below the level passed by republicans in the senate meanwhile the budget continues medicare subsidies close to 60 billion for managed care providers of medicare even though they are supposed to save medicare money not cost more the resolution also includes 228 billion over five years for additional tax cuts part of a 3 trillion tenyear republican tax cut agenda the republican resolution cuts appropriated funding for education and related programs below current services providing the same inadequate level as provided by the president for 2007 that repub ican level cuts funding for the department of education by 2 2 billion below last years comparable level and eliminates 42 education programs the spratt budget provides 4 6 billion more than the republican budget for education appropriations and over five years provides 45 3 billion more than the republican resolution the spratt budget rejects the deep cuts proposed by the republican budget and preserves programs such as vocational education perkins loans safe and drugfree schools state grants and the gearup college readiness program the spratt budget also makes a down payment on college affordability by cutting student loan interest rates after a temporary one year gain the republican budget after five years cuts funding for veterans health care by 6 0 billion below current services the spratt budget includes 6 0 billion more than the republican budget over five years for veterans health care the spratt budget also rejects the increase on health care fees on military retirees who are enrolled in tricare the republican budget asks additional sacrifices from those who have served and sacrificed for our country the spratt budget rejects the misguided republican policies and keeps our commitment to our veterans the republican budget cuts funding for health by 18 1 billion below current services over five years the same insufficient level provided by the president the republican level means cuts to priorities such as the centers for disease control 18 of 19 institutes at the national institutes of health and rural health activities the spratt budget provides 18 billion more over five years to fund health priorities cut by the republican budget including medical research at nih and graduate medical education for childrens hospitals the spraft budget also takes steps to address the problems with theimplementation of the medicare prescription drug benefit including extending the may 15 signup period through the end of year and protecting seniors from any enrollment penalties the spratt budget also takes steps to help the uninsured and creates a reserve fund to increase medicare payments to physicians which are currently scheduled to be cut for the environment and natural resources this republican budget imposes a 25 0 billion cut relative to current services over the next five years and imposes a 2 9 billion cut for next year alone this is the same level as the presidents budget which cuts funding for the environmental protection agency including the clean water state revolving fund the army corps of engineers and the national park service the house republican budget resolution actually makes the deficit worse offers no plan to bring the budget back to balance and adds to the growing burden of the national debt meanwhile the republican budget makes harmful cuts to critical services for the american people including education veterans services health and environmental protection i ask my colleagues to oppose this budget and support the spratt alternative budget"], [0.00039964914321899414, 0.999600350856781, 1, "happy birthday to my colleague let me resoundingly support the congressional black caucus budget and let me ask my colleagues what better budget to have than the one that saves 27 5 billion more in interest than the republican budget i cannot imagine that my good friend on the floor of the house would not welcome the opportunity of putting that interest into the needs of the american people we need affordable housing we can go to any city any rural community and not see people standing in line to access affordable housing section 8 touchers which allows affordable housing for families of four and five and six hardworking american there are 25 000 people on the list in houston texas alone millions of people are still on the list because they do not have affordable housing f 1245 finally i congratulate the gentleman from virginia and the gentleman from north carolina on this budget because it also invests in homeland security with all of the talk of the republican budget they do not fund immigration and customs officers they do not fund border patrol officers to secure our borders and provide for internal security the cbc budget does the obc budget puts 150 million in for border and customs needs this is a strong budget for the american people vote for the congressional black caucus budget save 27 5 billion in interest i think you will like that in your pocket and in your savings account i rise today to offer another choice to those americans who are disheartened by the current budget proposal being offered by this republican congress today we offer them the choice of accepting the congressional black caucuss cbc alternative budget truly it is the budget of hope and compromise it is the budget that closes the disparities in americas communities the cbc alternative budget provides both social and economic equality for americans instead of allowing the richest americans to pay fewer taxes at the expense of vital programs needed by lower and middle class americans surely this administration and the republican leadership in congress will pay lip service to the needs of these americans but this budget does more it demonstrates in writing that under our current budgetary situation it is possible to maintain necessary social programs while practicing true fiscal responsibility the cbc alternative budget is particularly strong in its support of educational programs the greatest key we possess to close disparities in our society this administration and the majority in this congress promised to leave no child behind but clearly they have reneged on their promise the republican budget eliminates 48 education programs that receive 4 3 billion this year these eliminations include wiping out 1 3 billion for all vocational education programs 522 million for all education technology programs and 29 million for all civic education programs the republican budget eliminates other large programs including the even start family literacy program 225 million and state grants for safe and drugfree schools and communities 437 million in fact the presidents budget cuts 2006 funding for the department of education by 1 3 billion below the amount needed to maintain purchasing power at the current level and by 530 million below the 2005 enacted level of 56 6 billion this is the first time since 1989 that an administration has submitted a budget that cuts the departments funding the cbc alternative budget in stark contrast provides a much needed boost of 23 9 billion to education and training including 2 5 billion for school construction the cbc alternative fully funds the fiscal year 2006 authorization level for no child left behind nclb and provides for an expansion of the head start program in addition the cbc alternative doubles federal funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions again closing the disparities often witnessed in higher education in that regard the cbc alternative increases the pell grant allotment for college students because as we all know a mind any mind is a terrible thing to waste clearly the cbc alternative emphasizes this ideal more than the republican budget resolution few things are more important to americans than their home and their communities while the president and this republican congress take steps to make it harder for average americans to reach homeownership the cbc alternative invests heavily in this vital sector it funds home ownership initiatives that help families build real wealth in the city of houston alone we have 25 000 people waiting on a list to obtain affordable housing these homes will provide them the stability and equity to build their lives and eventually achieve their own prosperity we shame ourselves when we deny them the opportunity to do so the cbc alternative also restores 1 122 billion for vital community block grants which were gutted in the republican budget resolution without the ability to build up our communities how can we change peoples realities without community development we allow these disparities to continue unabated the cbc alternative budget does not remove any money from the overall defense and homeland security budget instead it takes 7 7 billion out of the ballistic missile defense program which has so far proven to be a failure and redirects the money to additional support for the troops in iraq homeland security needs and veterans programs and benefits among the items of support for the troops in iraq is 75 million of body armor personal support equipment and other protective gear for troops and vehicle armor all of which we know the troops are in urgent need of the cbc alternative provides an additional 2 05 billion for homeland security including funds for improving rail and port security which have always been high risk targets for attack this alternative budget provides 4 65 billion for veterans funding so that when our brave men and women return home from fighting the war on terror they will know that their nation is ready and willing to take care of them the cbc alternative also funds the important sector of immigration as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration border security and claims i worked with the cbc to get funding for 150 million for immigration and customs enforcement ice agents and border patrol agents truly we are undermanned in this vital sector in addition as a member of the house science committee i worked with the cbc to fund an additional 500 million for general science space and development and support the research and development efforts of nasa the national science foundation nsf the national institute of standards and technologies nist and the department of energy in addition to research and development the cbc alter native also supports additional safety measures for the space shuttle program which should be at the forefront of nasas efforts after the columbia space shuttle tragedy space and science represent yet another way to eliminate disparities through knowledge and discovery this cbc alternative budget is proof positive that we can properly fund social programs while still paying down more of the hational debt than the republican budget again i say that this budget represents hope instead of the despair we feel when looking at the republican budget resolution it id a hope for ending the disparities that continue to divide us and keep us to this day from achieving our full potential as a nation"], [0.00040477514266967773, 0.9995952248573303, 1, "a track record a

not have a good credit record am i right let me just tell you something right now as it relates to the united states i am looking at japan you can put japan in the state of florida and the state of florida will swallow geographically japan but better yet look what they are holding of the unitedstates apple pie the bottom line is this is about the incompetence cronyism and in some cases corruption of these individuals being able to get access into this institution and into the executive branch to be able to get what they want i want to drive the point on here i want to make sure this is crystal clear it has to be crystal the bottom line is the only way that we will be able to have a paradigm shift not only in thinking but in policy and action on behalf of the american people and unless the american people like you say the majority they do not have to be the majority the american people can make that change they can say that we are willing to allow the democrats to lead so that we can hopefully start taking care of some of these issues that we have to take care of here at home with our troops in iraq and afghanistan and throughout the world so that we can get the respect of not only the world but our country our own country veterans they signed up for all the right reasons allowing us to salute one flag as we see it now are being asked to do more financially meanwhile 1 5 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy while we have individuals while we are having veterans affairs centers closing in rural america and in urban america they are closing some of them are only open on wednesday now but meanwhile we have individuals we have the president every time he gets a chance he is talking about let us make the tax cuts permanent for people who are not even asking for it so this is very simple this speech on what the majority republicans say well trust us we know what we are doing we showed the letter from secretary snow i think we already know this we did not write this letter the guy has said the fifth time the secretary is saying we will not be able to operate the government that is one letter here is the other one here fortytwo presidents this president and republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion but better yet saying let us make a bad idea permanent let us drive this number up let us put a two here instead of a one it does not make

lobbyists thriving i never blame the special interests for what happens here but i am going to tell you right now they have a tax shelter right now where 100 billion in unitedstates taxpayer dollars are not going into the coffers because they have an offshore deal with this administration and with this majority meanwhile we are sitting around here trying to figure out how our veterans are going to get health care meanwhile we are trying to figure how small businesses will be able to afford health care for everyday americans to be able to buy into and meanwhile we have troops still without body armor and the things they need to be able to fight on behalf of this country so we ask everyday americans to go out there and suck it up meanwhile the majority the republican majority based on incompetence some may say corruption in some cases as it relates to the white house i mean every day i am sorry every day we turn on the television what is new what is going on at the white house what is being held back from the american people what is being held back from the congress who came to the hill today and conflicted a story that they told just months ago about the fiscal outlook on the country meanwhile you have members that come up to this well on the majority side and say we are doing fine i do not know what these democrats are talking about but it goes against logic we have

the bottom line is that we have a republican majority that rubber stamps everything that the administration hands to them they cant even put the paper on the desk fast enough before they rubber stamp it when you start talking about the fact that by the constitution we are supposed to carry out oversight that is not a value of the republican majority li 1915 oversight of what no see they are too busy taking care of the special interests you would think that some members were more concerned with trying to make sure that special interests got what they needed because we do not want to forget the k street project where you pay to play and you get access into this republican majority house so when you look at the rubberstamping of what has happened here i cannot help but have this stamp here because that is how we got here but what is very very unfortunate is the fact that we have ourselves in a situation in a fiscal situation that is going to take a generation almost to recover from we have ourselves in a situation in iraq we do not know how many years it may take for us to recover from that and i am using the presidents words now we have ourselves in a situation where the white house now wants to invite members over to have tea and cookies right now and trying to be niceynice to say we want to hear from you now but we have men and women caught in the crossfire and we have millions and billions of dollars that have been wasted and stolen in iraq i am going to say stolen because of the rubberstamp republican majority anything that the administration sends down how can we rubberstamp it matter of fact i think the republican majority walks around with a little mini rubber stamp in their pocket saying oversight this is the way you want it and how you want it the american people have to send a very strong message to this republican majority here in the congress that we have three branches of government for a reason not two branches of government that deals with legislation and policy but three branches we have the judicial branch that is separate and aside but when you look at the legislative branch we are supposed to carry out oversight only a couple of members of the republican majority actually gets that and tries to practice it but they are in a superminority and so the reason why we come to the floor is to shed light on the lack of oversight when it was a democratic house and a democratic white house there was oversight cajl bill clinton up and ask him i think we know that republican majority the reason why you are going to see people around here scratching and fighting and begging and trying to do anything and throwing out the sods and trying to get press releases out because the white house is very very concerned that they will no longer be able to send legislation to the unitedstates house of representatives and that it passes through committees that may have a half a meeting on it and come to the floor not allowing democrats to do anything to improve the legislation because they are too busy rubberstamping the process and it will disrupt that it is all about power and influence and i can tell you right now the republican majority has gone too far with this because that is the reason why we are in the situation we are in now and they are known they have to shake it and they know it and they deserve the rubber stamp because that is what they have been doing since the president has been in the white house i am coming to ms jacksonlee i just want to give you a perfect example of what happens in a rubberstamp congress exhibit a how can you borrow 1 05 trillion in 4 years i do not even know how that can be achieved in 4 years the republican majority has handed president bush he cannot do it on his own we have the republican congress right under him from 2001 to 2005 1 05 trillion now here is the other kicker that comes in and with interest fortytwo presidents 224 years 224 years 42 presidents were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion i rest my case on that i rest my case on the fact that the republican majority has given the bush white house everything they wanted on the backs of the american

congressional black caucus is offering an alternative budget proposal that differs from both the presidents budget and the house majoritys budget by putting america and americans first its focus is to reduce disparities that exist in americas communities by investing in the priorities and challenges that americans face today it also provides significant support for our troops in iraq at the same time the cbc budget alternative accomplishes these goals in a manner that is much more fiscally responsible than the republican budget so much so as this chart shows the budget deficit each year is much less a total of a 167 billion deficit reduction over 5 years so much so that it saves just in interest cost alone 27 5 billion over 5 years the congressional black caucus alternative builds for americas future and addresses the domestic challenges our country faces the bulk of the cbc budget has been applied to a comprehensive approach to education and training with the intention of closing achievement and opportunity gaps in education the cbc budget dramatically increases funding for education and training programs by 23 9 billion over the proposed republican budget next year alone the cbc budget supports public education by fully funding no child left behind provides critical funding for head start trio idea and elementary and secondary school counseling to address the education needs of our military families the cbc budget allocates more funding for impact aid millions of atrisk students are hoping to succeed in high school and enroll in college and to make that dream a reality the cbc alternative allocates funding for the gearup program raises the maximum amount for pell grants increases funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanicserving institutions in addition the cbc budget funds for the perkins student loan program as well as job training adult education and vocational education programs that are critical in todays global economy in order to close the existing economic disparities in the united states and to help entrepreneurs realize the american dream the cbc alternative funds job creation programs under the small business administration it suapports community development programs including community development block grants child nutrition programs and health programs such as community health centers the budget also addresses disparities in housing and believes that everyone in the united states is entitled to a safe and comfortable home it supports hope vi section 8 housing programs housing for the disabled and elderly and low income energy assistance the budget also provides funding for amtrak and public transportation the cbc recognizes that advancements in technology and science are necessary to maintain americas competitiveness in todays global economy the budget supports funding for research and development particularly in aeronautics and nasa and increases funding for the national science foundation the national institute of standards and technology and the department of energy as well as measures for space shuttle safety the congressional black caucus budget alternative also recognizes the importance of adding to the safety of our communities by funding initiatives such as juvenile crime prevention programs and prisoner reentry programs the funding for these important domestic needs comes from rolling back tax cuts for an individuals adjusted gross income that is over 200 000 and eliminating several abusive tax loopholes including corporate incentives to move jobs overseas moreover the congressional black caucus budget does not adopt the new tax cuts in cluded in the republican budget the cbc revenues are used for the domestic and deficit reduction portions of the alternative budget the cbc budget is also committed to making america more secure the funding for urgent homeland security needs veterans programs and benefits and additional support for defense and our troops in iraq comes from a 7 8 billion reduction in ballistic missile defense leaving 1 billion in the program for continued research it is a priority of the cbc to provide american soldiers with the equipment necessary to return home from iraq in a safe quick and successful manner to that end a portion of these funds have bedn reallocated to protect our trodps in iraq by providing them with body armor vehicle armor and other personal support equipment as well as for the construction and maintenance of our navy vessels which will preserve jobs the cbc understands that providing homeland security requires appropriate funding to meet the many pressing needs in homeland security and therefore we have substantial funding for port security grants and rail security grants as well as funding for first responders federal air marshals and border patrol agents the remainder of these funds are used to restore cuts in veterans programs and benefits the cbc understands that todays soldiers are tomorrows veterans who deserve our respect and sacrifices not just in word but in deed and in budget thus the alternative budget makes critical increases in veterans programs and benefits a substantial portion of which is health care it also supports funding for longterm care initiatives medical and prosthetic research and mental health care among others we believte that the sum of these initiatives will make us more secure as a nation the cbc is committed to reducing disparities in all of americas communities at the same time our budget recognizes that we cannot place the burden on our children and grandchildren a top priority of the cbc is to address the exploding deficit problem and that is why our budget reduces the deficit by 167 billion and saves 27 billion in interest payments compared to the house majoritys budget members of the cbc have worked tirelessly to create a budget that is fiscally responsible supports our troops and recognizes the need of

anybody can remember billions and billions and billions of dollars worth of damage an entire city entire region almost totally destroyed over 250 000 american citizens without homes we all remember those pictures down in new orleans in the flood our hearts went out to those people well our hearts must continue to go out to those people and the reason it is the height of hypocrisy is here is the president of the united states and this republican controlled congress who says that they want to offset a 70 billion tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country on the backs of those poor victims of this hurricane on the front page of the washington post this morning the answer from fema is to throw 150 000 american citizens who have become homeless on the street the answer from the white house and the answer from this congress has been to cut the very programs that will help these victims the most the most effective programs that have helped them has been the food stamp program and under this budget this republican held congress and this president proposes to cut food stamps by 850 million not only at a time when we have people who are homeless without jobs without hope but according to the agriculture department just this year alone we have added 2 million more citizens to the hunger roles the republicans answer cut the very program that has been designed to help them by 850 billion medicaid under this budget planned by the republicans and president bush they want to cut medicaid by 12 billion when 45 million americans mostly senior elderly citizens are going without any kind of health insurance and our farmers cut them by 2 billion farmers who have been devastated by the flood who have been hurt by the flood now is not the time to cut the farmers and our veterans 3 billion lord knows we have not been doing right by our veterans we have cut them we have cut them we have cut them and the presidents answer is cut the veterans this republican congresss is to cut the veterans is that not a reason why they have had difficulty in getting the votes why they have had to pull the bill last week and the american people need to wake up and understand and put the calls in to your republican congressman to let them know that america does not want to cut the basic services for the needy while trying to add a 70 billion tax cut for the millionaires and the billionaires they do not need the money but the children do this budget will cut childrens nutrition by 2 billion and 5 billion in child support heating oil is cut at a time when the oil companies are getting record profits and their execputives are sitting fast student loans 14 billion at a time when going to college costs so much there will be tens of thousands of american children who will not go to college if this republican budget reconciliation bill passes that is why this is so important that is why it is important listen to me america and if you know other people tell them to tune in we are here to tell you the facts this blue dog coalition is one of the most influential groups on capitol hill and the reason why is because people trust us we have earned that we have earned that distinction folks like charlie stenholm john tanner they have pioneered and set the curve respect across party lines respect across this country the blue dog coalition we are speaking the truth tonight william shakespeare said it well when he wrote that great play julius caesar when he said et tu brutus yours is the meanest cut of all and that is what these republicans are doing in this bill it is mean it is cold and it is wrong and the american people deserve better and we are going to give them better so mr ross and my fellow blue dogs we are here tonight to speak the truth we are here tonight to let the american people know and we hope and we pray that we will be successful in stopping this budget reconciliation bill from being devastating to the american people"],

is not working now is the fact that we are governing under a culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence one cannot operate a business under a culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence they cad just not do it they cannot do it it is impossible to achieve and it is wrong so when we have historic levels of corruption incompetence and cronyism it is just hard for us to govern in that way people are wondering why am i picking up my newspaper not only seeing indictments but seeing plea agreements by the very people that are elected to come up here to govern on behalf of the american people so why is it even shocking to some members why we have so much corruption in the federal system and we come in here as though let me grab a cup of coffee or a latte like it is another day at the office it is not another day at the office it is not another day here in congress we are concerned but maybe the majority could also get a little concerned about what is g6ing on let me just mention something because mr delahunt just hit a couple of points and i just want to mention something because here in the 30something working group as my colleagues know and others and i am so glad that mr ryan claimed this hour the bottom line is this we have a white house where members of the white house have been indicted or previous members who resigned the day before they were indicted and serious national security breaches in the white house this is not hearsay this is fact we have federal investigators now they are not talking about someone who took a trip somewhere on the governments credit card they are not talking about that you know someone went to lunch with someone and you know the bill was 3 000 and they had eight lobsters they are not talking about that they are talking about outing cia agents they are talking about information being leaked out that is jeopardizing national security they are also talking about issues as it relates to you know the influence of the private sector and corruption and not possible cronyism but cronyism and incompetence that is what is going on here now and even here in the congress unprecedented investigations inquires not by the congress but by other agencies that are policing us so when people start saying well why is all of this happening it is happening because we are not well the congress the majority is not governing the way that they should govern and policing themselves i think it is important as we look at this culture of corruption and cronyism and incompetence that we put it in the right perspective we know that a lot of this is allegations we will just say allegations i want to make sure that we say that but i want to also make sure that members know exactly what is going on this is not regular business in the congress the 109th congress historians will reflect and in the present will say this has never happened before in the historyof the republic so when folks start talking about well you know i do not know what you are talking about i am going to tell you another thing they are coming to the floor the majority tomorrow to pass tax cuts on behalf of billionaires and millionaires meanwhile just before we left here they cut student loans cut medicaid cut child support enforcement somebody please tell me this is a misprint but it is not and going after deadbeat dads so i wonder how the state attorneys and sheriffs are going to feel about that they cut many programs that we need in this country meanwhile back at the ranch we are going to turn our back on what is going on in iraq and what is going on here in washington d c as though it is not a big deal so i think the gentleman from massachusetts is in order when he talks about some of the decisions that are being made and one of any colleagues on this side said just because the republican leadership says it is true does not mean that it is true we were here on this floor late one night in the 108th congress and even in this congress but in the 108th congress on the prescription drug bill and the gentleman from ohio"], [0.000443875789642334, 0.9995561242103577, 1, "can i give you a thirdparty validator right now this man has to look familiar to the republican majority he has to newt gingrich was the man that came to the floor night after night and talked about what the republicans would do if they were able to take control of the house he talked about all of the things that you know he was talking about that just good government all right ow what is newt gingrich saying they talking about the republican majority are seen by the country as being in charge of a government that cannot function they not my republican colleagues not my good friends in congress they here is a major republican that served as speaker the first speaker in a number of years to serve as the speaker of this house calling his former colleagues and the people that he worked with and his office is right down the hall they because if newt gingrich is saying that this republican congress cannot function cannot run the country like it is supposed to be run cannot oversee the finances cannot make sure that americans have health care and small businesses are able to provide health care cannot give guidance and oversight to the department of defense and secretary rumsfeld cannot make sure that we let oil companies know that we are here to represent the american people and not their special interests not their profits and not their ceos that will retire to a pension making 150 000 a day not because they are that great it is because we have taken the taxpayers money and we have given it to them and now we have republican leaders saying well maybe we need to take the tax cuts back you just gave them and then you read something else no we should not take that tax cuts back because guess what the oil companies have representation in the republican majority period as i said last night a black man with a conspiracy theory but mr ryan i believe and i know and it is documented that the vide president and others sat down vith these oil companies and put this in motion long ago so members walking around here were having press conferences talking down this i do not know what happened i do not i did not see it coming what do you mean you cannot enforce prices it is just insane mr ryan for us to be the country that we are and for the federal trade commission to say well you know we think we have power we do not have the teeth that we need to really find out what is going on with those oil companies but i will tell you this i believe that these oil companiles have been a part of writing this legislation in the way to where that is hard to prosecute them and it is hard to get to the bottom line of who is doing what and guess what when there are no penalties it is h1most like having a house full of kids saying there is no time out there is no discipline whatsoever do as you may and everything in the house will be broken and every picture will be ripped off the wall that is what these oil companies are doing now i do not fault them i fault the republican majbrity and like i said last night mr ryan i am not going to ask them to lead anymore if they want to work in a bipartisan way we are ready to go we have been ready to go and if the american people see fit for us to be the majority party in the 110th congress and they will see an opportunity we will be able to work in a bipartisan way there will be a number of republicans that i do know some of my friends mr ryan and we do know them a very small number on the other side of the aisle see things the way we see it and the way the american people see it i know the reason why the poll numbers are what they are right now the president is not running again but the congress and this house every 2 years we go before the voters like i said last night mr ryan i do not care if it is a local republican committee chairman he or she has to have a problem with the borrowing that has been going on in this republican majority congress he or she must have a problem with the fact that no one can answer the questions on intelligence and the outing of cia agents he or she must have a problem if there are republican committee persons at the local level and on the state level with the fact that the k street project was allowed to operate under this dome by individuals that wore congressional pins that say yes we do have a k street project and yes if you are not on this list you dont get access to this government guess what that was okay we talked about it mr ryan the good thing is it is almost like showing up somewhere at the scene of an accident and saying time and time again we went to the police department we went to the city hall and said we needed a stop light here now look at this fatality i used to be a state trooper i can see it all the time report after report we didnt get the traffic light out there in time and people died because of it well guess what the people were beat down by this republican majority as it relates to good government because not what i am seeing and not what you are seeing mr ryan here is what members on the republican side of this house have said yes we have a k street project then we have a gentleman who admitted you dont have to call the jury you do not even have to assign a courtroom i am guilty i did it that is what this republican lobbyist said not only did i do it but i am going to help you go after some members of congress that were part of it i am going to help you identify other lobbyists that were a part of this great operation the k street project then the republican majority after he said what he said and the federal prosecutors did what they did said we denounce no longer k street project we dont know what you are talking about we will no longer condone it the k street project well mr ryan it sounds like when the president says well i dont know quite what we can do about gas prices but i do know that americans are addicted to oil come on the president and the vice president were part of putting this thing into motion the republican congress rubberstamped mr ryan everything that this administration said they wanted mr president you want tax cuts that you cannot afford so that we can put ourselves in debt and allow foreign countries to own more of america fine mr president the intelligence on iraq is kind of shaky but we hava to do what you want aid anyone who goes against you or says anything against you is unpatriotic and we will have congressional hearings to humiliate those individuals mr president payasyougo i know the democrats are there talking about maybe we need to pay as we go right now since we are in so much debt you want to continue to borrow and spend we got your back mr president because we are the republican congress and we are going to allow you to continue to drive this country in the way that special interests want to drive it because you know something when all the resources are gone and when all the opportunities are gone and when it is american taxpayers that are in debt where will the special interests be that is the question will they help bail this country out of the debt that this republican congress has delivered to them no that is the reason why that members if they are in their offices or they are walking around this building and if they are at home right now they need to sit up in bed and say you know something i need to go to work tomorrow with a new attitude i need to make sure that i fight on behalf of my constituents i need to have the same kind of drive that i had the night that i was elected doing all of those things i said i would do all of those things all of those plans everything i talked about in the campaign about representing whatever district they may be running from in my case the 17th congressional district they call that being born again mr ryan and a baptist term being born again to public service i am excited by the fact that the american people they are not getting it they got it they got it then wewill continue to get it because time after time mr ryan this

that is up to the next congressman that represents youngstown the reason why the president is saying whatever he wants to say when he wants to sayit is because this republican congress has allowed him to say it and get away with it qur job is not the daytoday operation of the war in iraq it is our job to bring in this presidency making sure that we are accountable to those troops that are on the ground and our mission the bottom line is what is our mission i mean these are the individuals that gave this congress bad information and then the minute that they gave the congress bad information got away with it there were weapons of mass destruction thefn apologize well we got bad information on weapons of mass destruction i am sorry you know hey it happens but individuals have died now we have iraqi troops that are now being downgraded they cannot even fight without unitedstates troops backing them up then the secretary says well you know there may be acivil war there is a civil war going on in iraq let us just say it let usput it out there the coalition you do not hear anything about the coalition getting bigger and greater no it is not getting bigger and greater matter of fact the brits are leaving this year and a number of other countries have said hey you know i am willing to take the training wheels off the iraqi army let me just say this because i think that mr ryan laid it out so that everyone can understand a new member ofcongresscould understand what you just set out the bottom line is that trying is not good enough we need the american people to chime in and make their member of congress stand up on behalf of the american people mr ryan said correctly and backed it up with the congressional record the fact that we have a republican majority that is more loyal to an individual riding around here making 1 billion or 1 million a year or record profits or whatever their industry is than they are committed to container security it is not just what kendrick meek is saying that is the fact and mr ryan laid it out and yes we do have a level of frustration folks say you seem like you are upset well we should be upset and i do not care if it is democrat independent or republican mr delahunt said it earlier as far as ports containers come into a port guess what there are trucks that they go on the back of and trains that they go on the back of they go throughout america and next thing you know this issue makes it to the heartland or sioux city iowa or whatever the case the people may say well that is a coastal issue that is not a coastal issue it is an american issue e 2320 and they have been allowed to do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it because this congress hasnt reined them in i am going to close in 1 second but i just want to also point out madam speaker since we are pointing out a few things here that we have turned on the lights here in the chamber this whole dubai thing and the republicans marching around we stopped that from happening we blocked that deal well guess what there were a couple of votes before that where theytried to block it but procedurally they blocked the democrats from doing that it is not who blocked it it is about how we got there how did an under secretary level individual make this kind of decision the outsourcing of american security it happens every day ms wasserman schultz and i can tell you this we are standing up to the president no you are not standing up to the president but guess what when all of america is standing on this side of the line and saying are you representing us or who are you representing are we standing upfor dubai what did the president say i got a little confused there members i am sorry the president said well we have got to keep our word what about keeping our word to the american people on security and health care and all those things hetalked about during the canpaign and all the republican members won the majority because they said trust us on security trust us on fiscal responsibility dont get me started on fiscal responsibility it is almost like the guy running from the back of the class who is an f student who says i want to be the valedictorian of the class because i say that i am did not work did not study did not do the things that he needed to do to be the top person in the class but better yet because they say it that makes it right what does this mean mr delahunt this means if the american people see fit that the democrats are in charge of the congress that the white house will not be making statements and saying well we have said it publicly so that means you cant do anything about it republican congress and if folks want to talk about a democratic plan in iraq it is accountability it is making sure we take these nobid contracts and put them on top of the table and really get down to the treason why we are still in iraq i am just talking about what i am talking about mr delahunt i am not saying there are some shady deals but there are a number of articles that are out that ire pointing to this every day this stuff is coming out and i think it is very very important that we focus in on

keep from spending again what you need is a 12step program on spending it is called intestinal fortitude it is called having a spine it is called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or even billions of dollars that you did not work to earn then this congress wants to serve you but if you get up every day and go to work to earn a living then dont expect any help from this congress the message all of this sends could not be clearer the republicans value wealth not work if you hold up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this congress to treat americas working families with the respect and dignity they have earned the choice to provide hundreds of billions more in tax breaks for the ultrawealthy is shameful its even more

hutf i nomic run inthe last2 decades and it iso is a controlled giowth it is a growth that hag not gotten out of hanhd mr speaker it is a growth that grows frbm 3 to 4 7 percent quarter afi 6ei quarter with an inflation rate that is 2 percent or less and unemployment rates that are in the 5 percent and less range that is where we want not too hot and not too cold a nice steady accountable growth and i would point out this that growth that we have in our economy is growing in spite of the fact that 3 5 percent perhaps of our gdp is going off the top to the litigation that goes on in this country we have to overcome that and still grow at a rate of about 3 to 3 5 percent to match a targeted growth rate that will deal with population growth and to deal with inflation and help us develop our infrastructure in this country to accommodate the future as our infrastructure depreciates that is what it is going to take to grow and what it is going to take to balance the budget should we have the will to do that would be to go into the nondefense discretionary spending recognizing that we have three large entitlements in our budget and those are the spending that just goes on year after year that is growing at a rate of about 6 2 percent a year and that is aggregate and that is social security medicare and medicaid those three entitlements are essentially unless we change some of the larameters are the right now the un touchable budget items and eventually this congress will have to look at them but those three entitlements will grow at about 6 2 percent of their aggregate the interest rate will grow perhaps even faster than that in the outyears you add all those things up and if you recognize that to make changes in that for this year is very difficult to do and also recognizing that we have defense spending that is critical to our national security and we need to take that off the table from a cut perspective and what is left is the nondefense discretionary spending that is the items of all everything else that we spend that i have not identified as being an entitlement of social security medicare medicaid defense spending that nondefense discretionary spending we will call that other to balance the budget we would need to simply cut the nondefense discretionary spending by 5 percent areal 5 percent cut and that would be 0 95 on the dollar that would be asking americans to get along with 0 95 out of every dollar that they have right now today not grow in relation to inflation and not grow with any kind of a cola now if i were looking at this from a business perspective i would advocate that we just simply balance our budget in that fashion but i am also aware that the votes on the floor of this congress will rot accommodate for that so i will be seeking to put together a budget that looks at some of the other components and gets us to the point where we can reasonably practically and in fact part of the equation here is politically balance this budget it cannot and should not be done by simply raising taxes by doing so it would stifle growth and it would get a reverse effect beyond in the opposite direction that my colleagues who just got finished speaking would say i am just going to go backwards through some of the remarks that i heard made over this past hour and address some of them i certainly cannot address them all but the argument that all of the money that was spent all this is a quote all that money is wasted meaning the money that was spent for reconstruction in iraq all wasted with no oversight no oversight mr speaker i take exception to a statement such as that i went over to iraq with three of my colleagues last august and returned here about august 20 with the very mission in mind to take a look at where the 18 5 billion that we allocated out of this congress had been spent where the practices were where the projects were how the money was being spent and what was the return on that investment and i brought a chart along with me coincidentally not knowing that would be the subject matter that was brought up here on the other side of the aisle this evening a chart that illustrates where these project dollars have gone i would point out that these red dots on this map of iraq represent 2 200 more than 2 200 completed projects in iraq and these projects will be road projects they will be sewer projects water drinking water potable water projects they will also be some bridge projects and some pipeline work for the oil pipe lines that are there you will see along on this border with iran the red dots along there many of those are border defense stations and what you will not see are the 250 planned border defense stations that are under construction or in planning around these othei borders that we have there is another 1 100 projects that are either in planning or under construction that do not show up yet on this chart i will have a chart that reflects the projects that are planned the projects that are started then this one reflects just the projects that are completed over 2 200 and i visited a number of these of course it would not be possible to visit them in their entirety but i stopped up here in this region around kirkuk and there went to the mother of all generators i forget just how many kilowatts that generator does put out but i remember what it weighed 750 000 pounds brought in on two large loads and then the other loads would be the rest of the generating plant across about 10 7 kilometers excuse me it was more than that it was a long stretch at least across the northern part of iraq with that kind of a long trail ofa convoy to deliver the generator and the turbine that drives that generator down to this location just south of kirkuk and that being one of two huge generation plants that are now in a position where they are up and running in iraq this one is fed by a natural gas pipeline some of them are using different types of fuel but up in this area around kirkuk there is so much oil that it actually seeps to the top of the ground in some places where i come from the area we call it the prairie pothole region where we have these potholes of water that are collected because of the dips that are cut out in the prairie from the last glacier well the water that collects there reminds me of the oil and certainly the oil is in smaller quantities that collects in the depressiois within the desert up there around kirkuk i and that is not the largest oil location up around kirkuk but down here in the southern part in the basra region there is far more oil and i look at the system of collection the well system the collection system the refinery system distribution system all of it is old tired dilapidated has not been reconstructed or modernized in at least 35 years and yet the oil production out of iraq is greater than it was we keep hearing no they are not producing as much oil now as they were then not true the royalties that iraq was receiving prior to the war were 5 billion a year the royaltiesthat are coming from the oil that is pumping today are 26 billion a year that does not necessarily reflect that they are pumping five times as much oil but it reflects that they are selling perhaps more oil than they did then and pumping more oil than they did the electricity that is being generated in iraq is anumber that is close to twice as much electricity at their peak days as it was on a standard day in iraq at the beginning of the liberation back in march of 2003 and as i measure project after project benefit after benefit it cannot be said that and i will quote again all that money is wasted how could all that money be wasted when we have 2 200 completed projects 3 300 projects altogether people that have potable water that never had it before people that have flush toilets that did not flush before they did not have water to flush in them looking at the infrastructure that is there in places in baghdad where they had the sanitary sewer and i would point out for the lay person listening that a sanitary sewer is not really all that sanitary that is what you run your sewage through and yet that sewer was an easy place for some people to pull a waterline through in those days before the ltberation of baghdad so their drinking water in many areas was delivered through a black piece of plastic pipe that was pulled through the sewer itself and they would pull it through and then the distribution runs out to the locations where it was being used and that is all fine as long as you keep your waterline in condition and it does not ever get a leak in it and you do not ever let the pressure go down but both of those things invariably happen and when that happens the pressure goes down in your drinking waterline and the sewage then is drawn into that drinking waterline and it then pollutes the drinking water that has happened in a number of areas in baghdad we are reconstructing that we are providing them with clean new sanitary sewer systems and sewer plants to be able to handle their systems in a modern fashion and an environmentally friendly fashion so the iraqi people that were living without services now have services i will say that the electrical service that was up to 10 11 perhaps even 12 hours a day in baghdad at the beginning of the liberation is down to less than that now perhaps even as low as 4 to 6 hours a day but the rest of iraq was getting 2 to 4 hours a day and now they are up to 10 11 12 hours of electricity a day the next wave is to increase the generation capacity and the distribution so that baghdad can get back up again to a level that they were before but overall there is more electricity being provided into iraq today than there ever was the demand is perhaps twice as great as it was because you know what happens when people get electricity they figure out a way that they can put another appliance to work and plug it into a wall and use it like air conditioners that did not exist in any significant numbers now they are there in significant numbers tapped into that electricity we also know that satellite televisions were against the law in march of 2003 and today iraq is replete with satellite dishes onrooftop after rooftop in fact i did a survey from the air by helicopter over the top of a region up in kirkuk where many homes were built in about the same style and i had done so over the rooftops of mosul in the fall of 2003 and there my survey showed that about twothirds of the homes then already had satellite tvs and now iam seeing that in some of the neighborhoods in kirkuk there actually are more satellite dishes than there are roofs so you will see sometimes two or even three satellite dishes on a single roof that look like they are singlefamily dwellings from the air everyone in iraq has access to satellite tv which means access to the outside world there is access to internet cell phones those things have grown dramatically landline telephones have grown dramatically the number of newspapers are up to over 175 newspapers in iraq television stations up and running communication is flowing free enterprise is robust in the streets of baghdad people that are running shops out there making furniture out alongside the streets set it out on the side of the street and sell it and yes a bomb goes off once in a while and it is sad and it is tragic but the people of iraq clean things up and they grieve and they go back to work because they are optimistic about the future of iraq they are more optimistic about the future of iraq than the surveys show people are in the united states of america what went wrong her6 where people that we say do not have hope have more hope than those of us folks that have the great blessing of living in the united states of america with all of this hope that we take for granted and cannot apparently appreciate so the effort that has been put forth there it is not all that money that is being wasted not by a long shot mr speaker 3 300 projects all of them worthy and worthwhile and no they were not all cheap there was money that was spent for security and there were some projects that were sabotaged that had to be reconstructed again there is a project over here on the tigris river south of kirkuk where there were nine pipelines that went across the tigris river and those pipelines were cut in the liberation operations with the unitedstates air force and we went back to patch those pipelines together did so they were sabotaged again they were put across the river on a bridge and so we undertook the effort to put them all underneath the bottom of the tigris river they are backfilling that now and it is nearly completed and those lines will be opened up and running by i believe the target date is february 28 so another big day to turn those valves on and get that oil flowing south into parts where it can be converted back to cash and be able to help the funding in the great country of iraq this emerging free arab country that has now at least brought forth the name of a prime minister and i do not think formally has elected him yet but on that day that that happens and they seek this duly elected parliament iraq becomes the most representative arab nation in the world when they sit down at the united nations and their representative speaks on behalf of the iraqi people it will truly be a voice of the iraqi people quite unlike the voice of much of the rest of the arab world where the voicethat speaks for the countries that represent those parts of the arab world in the united nations often is the voice of a tyrant that would cut the tongues out of its oin citizens if they spoke up in criticism of the regime that is there in many of those countries but this country can become the lodestar of a free arab people an inspiration to the rest of the arab world an that is a chilling concept but it also inspiration that can cause the rest of should tell us that there is no negothem to see what iraq is stepping into tiated settlement we must defend ourwhat they are earning along with the selves the israelis have had to guard coalition forces efforts and sacrifice to every theater every bus stop every be able to be that inspiration for the hospital every school every synarest of the arab world and if that day gogue and still the infiltrators come in comes and i pray it comes mr speak and detonate their bombs and blow er we may well see freedom echo their women and children to pieces across the arab world in the same fash that happens out of a deep hatred ion that it echoed across eastern eu that we dont understand in this counrope when the wall went down in ber try and i dont claim to understand it lin november 9 1989 on that glorious but i know that hatred is directed at day that symbolized the end of the us we saw it september 11 we saw it cold war a victory for the united on 18 to 20 other attacks including the states and the forces of freedom uss cole we saw it in the unitedstates emand the forces of freedom could not bassy bombings in africa we have seen be stopped almost the first attack also on the twin towbloodlessly they echoed across eastern ers in other efforts shut off by good ineurope and we saw country after coun telligence work in this country try be liberated we cannot rest our choices though are guard every theater every bus 0 2320 stop every school every hospital since that time we have noticed every church every synagogue and pull that those who knew freeddm the least back into the shores of the united hungered for it the most the people on states and somehow think that we can the east side of the wall stepped up to protect every center in this country help all of our efforts our coalition and we wont be able to and we will see forces in iraq in greater numbers than the attacks come and we will see our the people on the west side of the wall women and children and our men blown the people on the west side of the into pieces wall had the privilege of living with or we can take this battle to them freedom since the end of world war 11 we can fight this war where they are the people on the east side of the wall but going out just to kill the enemy remember the days they werent free mr speaker isnt enough it is not a they remember the day of november 9 solution it is something that has to be 1989 when they had that opportunity done in certain areas of the world and to grasp their own freedom and within under those circumstances where there a couple of years that freedom did echo are training camps and active leaders across eastern europe and it needs to that are plotting and planning to atecho across the arab world tack and kill americans that must be so i submit that there done is a vision and mission in this overall but to go out and think that we war on terror and we need to do a far could kill all of our enemies is the better job of articulating why we are in equivalent of realizing that we had a this war i would point out that the lot of flies on our porch and in our loss of americans on september 11 was kitchen and then go out to the barn right at 3 000 americans that is more with the fly swatter and think we are americans lost there than was lost de going to take care of all those flies in cember 7 1941 in that day that would the barn with the fly swatter no you live in infamy can swat flies in the barn all day every we cannot forget september 11 we day and you will never accomplish the cannot forget that we were attacked task you have got to change the habiwithout cause we didnt provoke any tat that breeds that many flies you one who attacked us they attacked us have to clean the barn because they hate our way of life they and you need to leave an environment attacked the very center of western in there that doesnt breed those flies civilization and then they will leave you alone on and no amount of negotiation un the porch and in your kitchen as well derstanding no amount of sitting so i submit that the plan of the around and talking is ever going to re united states and the mission that has solve this disagreement these people been laid out by our commanderinwant us dead they have demonstrated chief president bush is to create a new that and we saw the celebrations in habitat to promote a new habitat in the streets in other parts of the world the region this is a habitat called as the twin towers fell that should freedom we happen to know that tell us that they will give us no quar where there is freedom there isnt a ter habitat that breeds terrorists we have if anyone doubts that take a look at never gone to war against another free israel take a look and see the cir people it has never happened in the cumstanoes there when the israelis history of this country and i dont thought they could trade land for think it has actually happened in the peace and yet they are still attacked history of the world hamas won the election there that so to the extent that freedom can be means the terrorists the people who promoted and we give people that opare sworn to annihilate the land of portunity to reach out and grasp and israel are running the government of earn their own freedom is also the exthe region that may or may not be a tent to which we can be safer as a peonation called palestine ple western civilization can be safer and the people in that part of the world can learn some tolerance for christianity for judaism for capitalism for free enterprise for this whole idea of western civilization that they seem to take such exception to there are good people in that part of the world and those good people need to be empowered and we need to be supportive bf them the allegations that were made here on the other side of the aisle about corruption in iraq with millions of unitedstates dollars we dont know that and i wont tell you that you can go into an environment with a 18 5 billion mission and spend every dollar that would be competitive with a project in the united states because i know that some of that money had to go for security and some of that money had to go for a high price to get the work done because who would go into that environment and do that work but that work was necessary and to the extent that anyone hag defrauded this government yes we need to search that out we need to have oversight but democrats in this congress are not absolved from that responsibility i did not hear a single solution come out here on the other side of the aisle not one all i saw was complaints lamentations objections because all things that go wrong are all republican responsibility according to the other side of the aisle and of course if they were just in power then everything would be all fine but we dont know what they would do because they havent proposed a solution not a single specific solution they are absolutely without an agenda but they have enough energy they have enough air velocity in their lungs to every night come down here and beat

provisions including those reported out by our committee overall this bill is a step backward this bill will not lessen our dependence on foreign oil and it will do nothing to reduce energy prices it will increase the deficit weaken our economy compromise our national security and endanger our environment the supporters of this bill are certainly right about one thing we desperately need a good national energy policy this measure does not pass that test our growing dependence on foreign oil puts us at the mercy of unstable and unfriendly foreign regimes it gives terrorists additional targets and puts money in their hands it weakens the dollar by worsening the balance of trade we would start every day 500 millionplus in the hole on our balance of trade because of the imported oil it pumps money out of the domestic economy and into the hands of those who would wish us ill in short our oil dependence represents a significant and growing threat to our national security and national security should be first and foremost in the minds and hearts of everyone in this chamber so what do we do to reduce our dependence on foreign oil yes we need to increase the supply of fossil and nuclear and renewable energy but most importantly we need to become more energy efficient and does this bill do to make us more energy efficient virtually nothing the federal energy information administration found that last years energy bill would have almost no impact on energy demand and energy prices and that bill if anything made more of an effort to tame consumption the alliance for an energy efficient economy has estimated that this years energy bill would not save a single barrel of oil by 2020 that is both tragedy and farce we know how to treat our oil addiction we can make appliances more energy efficient without inconveniencing anyone we can make our cars more efficient without sacrificing safety my cafe amendment would reduce oil consumption in 2020 by 2 million barrels a day that is more than twice the amount that is expected per day from drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge what does this bill do instead of trying to make us more energy efficient at a time of fiscal crises and record oil prices the bill provides new mandatory spending that will go directly to the oil industry and it provides mandatory breaks for the oil industry on royalties the bill provides massive tax breaks for profitable oil companies and next to nothing for new technologies that could help wean us from foreign oil here is what the president said last week on that issue with 55 oil we dont need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore the presidents budget devoted 72 percent of its proposed energy tax incentives to alternatives this bill provides just 6 percent to alternatives while providing more than a billion dollars in additional tax breaks we would not have to look far to come up with better ideas while the house has been writing a bill based on ideological purity rather than careful analysis others have come forward with bipartisan sensible balanced approaches to energy policy groups like the national commission on energy policy and the alliance to save energy and the energy future coalition have all offered carefully considered proposals that could have formed the basis of an effective bill with republican credentials but instead we
