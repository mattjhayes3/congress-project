the leadership that she has taken on this issue especially urging and demanding an accurate count on the 2000 census this is not about political wedges this is about improving the quality of life that is what this issue is about it is not about political wedges it is about improving the quality of life this issue affects all americans this issue affects every man in america this issue affects every woman in america this issue affects every child in america during the census of 1990 nearly 18 000 residents of my congressional district were not couited i state 18 000 residents of my congressional district were not counted the undercount resulted in a loss of federal dollars and funds that would have benefited nearly 50 million in revenue that would have gone over the past 10 years because we failed to do an accurate count we lost 50 million over the last 10 years 50 million could have gone a long ways in providing much needed resources to my congressional district 50 million would have brought the inland empire roads and infrastructure 50 million could have brought the inland empire housing programs and projects and educational services law enforcement for cities parks and recreation senior citizen services youth centers educational services overall the state of california has lost out on more than 2 2 billion federal dollars and i state overall the state of california has lost out on more than 2 2 billion federal dollars due to the 1990 census undercount last week the lieutenant governor of california cruz bustamante warned that our state could lose 5 billion and i state 5 billion in federal funding if the undercount this year is similar to the 1990 undercount that is why i commend our colleague from new york for urging for an accurate count and demanding an accurate count not only what it means to my state but what it means to many other states across the nation as lieutenant governor cruz bustamante said we will have less than we deserve and i state we will have less than what we deserve this is not just a matter of loss of federal dollars people are being overlooked millions of americans are being overlooked it is a shame that california will not get its fair share of dollars if we do not do an accurate count that is why it is important that we do an accurate count not only for california but for others ten years ago millions of americans were not included in the census count a count that would have placed them equally alongside each and every other american in 1990 2 7 percent of people of california were not counted 2 7 percent 2 7 percent that means one out of every 37 people in california were not counted yet our population continues to grow we have 34 million people or more in the state of california it would be a shame if california did not have an accurate count and it did not receive its fair share of dollars back into our state the census undercount does not affect all americans in the same way again during the 1990 census 7 6 percent of the black population was overlooked in that counting i state 7 6 percent that means one out of every 13 black residents of california were not being counted also during the 1990 census 4 9 percent of hispanic residents of california were not counted that is 4 9 percent that means 4 9 roughly one out of every 20 latinos in california were not being counted imagine what it is going to be like this year if we do not do an accurate count it is a shame if we do not do that it is a shame that the leadership on the other side does not want to do an accurate count i am appalled that governor bush does not want to do an accurate count i think it is important that we all do it in the state of california that we do it in every state i am truly appalled 4 9 percent equals nearly 400 000 latinos in california not counted the last 10 years 400 000 is more than the population of fresno california 400 000 is more than the population of sacramento it is more than the population of oakland 400 000 people not being counted is 400 000 too many however it is not just a matter of blacks and latinos not being counted millions of children also were overlooked over the last 10 years nationwide more than 2 million children were not counted 10 years ago in california alone 342 000 children were not counted in the 1990 census that is 342 000 children imagine the services that could have gone back to our schools to our communities to our state this represents 4 2 percent of the children of california not being counted in 1990 this represents nearly one of every 24 children in california not being counted i join my colleagues here on the floor this evening in urging all americans to stand up and be counted this year i join with those who have been undercounted in the past in stressing the importance of being counted during the year 2000 census all americans should be counted this year if we do not do an accurate count the federal dollars do not come in and the taxpayers will have to pay for the services that we want and deserve i urge all of us to stand up and be counted whether we are white or whether we are american indians african americans hispanic asian americans we should all stand up together and be counted we are one nation a great nation and we are one people together unified and inclusive and i state inclusive and that is important that we are all included in this process and that every one of us is counted filling out the forms and mailing them back is important as the chair indicated that april 1 everyone has received it we urge everyone to return those back and to participate in the process it is the responsibility of a partnership between all of us it is not just the legislatures responsibility it is a partnership for the total community for busineses for schools for churches for our communities to come together and do what is necessary for our states if we come together collectively we will put our political wedges aside and we will do what is good for america we will do what is good for our country we will do what is good for our state i thank my colleague for providing me the opportunity to speak on this important issue and i yield the balance of my time back to the gentlewoman from new york who has done an outstanding job who is a true fighter and a true leader leading us in this important issue that is affecting all americans"], [0.0013616681098937988, 0.9986383318901062, 1, "this evening i would like to take to the well again and talk about health care issues because i do believe that when we talk about health care issues that this is really the unfinished agenda that this republican congress has not addressed of course there is still time we are still here we are here over the weekend are probably going to be here a good part of next week there was an effort yesterday when the tax bill was brought up by the republican leader ship to suggest that somehow some of the health care issues were being addressed in some minor way what i wanted to begin tonight was talk about how that bill really does not accomplish anything significant to help the average american with the health care problems that they face and with the hospitals and the nursing homes and the home health agencies that are trying to provide quality health care then after that i would like to get into the three major issues that most of my constituents and most americans talk to members of congress about and that is trying to reform hmos trying to provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and trying to deal with the 42 million americans who now have no health insurance let me start with this tax bill that was voted on and that the republican leadership brought up because they suggested i think inaccurately that what they were trying to accomplish was to deal with some of the problems that occurred with the balanced budget act which was passed a few years ago which cut back significantly on the money that was going to hospitals to home health care agencies to nursing homes and to hmos and that the reimbursement rate from the federal government from medicare medicaid and some of the other federal programs that provide funding to these facilities or to these programs that provide health care services needed to be readdressed that there was too little of a reimbursement rate under medicare and medicaid and that more money needed to go back to these programs or facilities if they were going to provide a quality health care the problem though was that in making these adjustments in this tax bill the republican leadership essentially gave most of the money to hmos in a fashion that i find totally objectionable because the hmos were not only getting huge amounts of money back from the federal government but were really not caused to do anything for the average american in order to receive those funds i said today in a press conference that we had outside on the lawn of the capitol with some of my democratic colleagues that the reason this was happening the reason why the tax bill was so favorable to the hmos is because basically the republican leadership has bought into the hmos and the special interests that are associated with the hmos and supports them because of the special interest funding that is made available what we see the hmos doing is that the hmos are leading the battle against the medicare prescription drug benefit and leading the battle against hmo reform the democrats and some republicans have tried to pass a bill called the patients bill of rights we know it as the norwooddingell bill it is bipartisan but it is opposed by the republican leadership the norwooddingell bill would make significant reforms to address the abuses of the hmos but the hmos are fighting that tooth and nail as well as the prescription drug benefit so i think that basically what happened here is the republican leadership sides with the hmos because they are basically against the medicare prescription drug benefit and against the patients bill of rights we also see that the hmos are spending a lot of money funding negative ads against those individuals democrats and against some republicans who support the patients bill of rights who support hmo reform who support having a prescription drug benefit under medicare so this is the sort of unholy alliance here that manifested itself yesterday with this tax bill to give more money back to the hmos now let me talk a little bit about this bill because i just want to show how unfair it was and how little it would accomplish in terms of addressing the health care needs that americans face today first of all and just to give my colleagues some figureg about the amount of money that was going to the hmos the republican plan this tax bill increases payments to medicare hmos by over 10 billion over 5 years and over 30 billion over 10 years despite the fact that only 16 percent of medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in hmos right now we know that what the hmos have been doing is they have been dropping senior citizens left and right as of july 1 i think there are over 700 000 seniors across the country that have been dropped by hmos to provide their medicare benefits over the last few years so a lot of these hmos got into the medicare program and then they dropped the seniors yet over onethird of the allocation in this tax bill over onethird of the allocation for health care that goes back to health care providers goes to hmos only 16 percent of medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in hmos my colleagues get some idea there of the inequity here now in addition to that we know that a lot of these hmos have dropped out of medicare so one might say to oneself well if they are making an argument they need more money to stay in medicare then why when we give them this windfall these billions of dollars this 30 percent of this overall budget then why do we not require that they come back into medicare and provide certain benefits well that makes sense but that is not what the republican leadership did there was no guarantee that these hmo plans will not drop out of communities or medicare altogether when it is no longer in their interest to remain as many of them have there is no guarantee that they will put new money towards maintaining benefits rather than shoring up their bottom line so we could have said okay we will give hmos all this money in the tax bill but they have to sign a contract saying they are going to stay in medicare for 2 years or 3 years or even 1 year we could have said okay we will give them this money but they have to make sure that they provide at least a level of benefits and prescription drugs for these 16 percent of seniors that are on medicare that they are providing now but we do not have that in the bill nothing like that just give them the money and that is fine they can continue to drop out of the program if they want to it is blatantly unfair it is just basically pandering to special interests now let me go beyond that to the next issue why is it that so much of this money is going to hmos again when so few seniors are in hmos that are in medicare we know that we have greater needs in a lot of other areas the hospitals do not get that much hospitals many have closed i had one in my district in south amboy that closed within the last year or so nursing homes many nursing homes are bankrupt i visited with some i went to a nursing home last week one of the days and talked to some of the residents i found out from the operators that there are i do not know what the percentage is but a significant percentage of the nursing homes in the state of new jersey are now bankrupt and some of them are closing home health care agencies very little money under this tax bill these are the providers remember the hmo is an insurance company they are getting this money now from this windfall from this republcan tax bill and they are going to go out and they are going to pay the hospitals or they are going to pay the nursing homes or they are going to pay the providers of health care services they are not providing the services but yet we shortchange the providers we do not give the money to the hospitals some of which are closing we do not give the money to the nursing homes some of which are closing we do not give the money to the home health care providers who are directly providing services it makes no sense it makes no sense at all unless one looks at it from the point of view that the hmos are special interests that are doing the republican leadership a favor and that are railing against hmo reform and a medicare prescription drug benefit now let me go to the last thing then i am going to get off the issue of this tax bill but i do think it is important and that is that the republican leadership said well one of the things we are going to do in this tax bill is we are going to try to address the problems of the uninsured by giving what we call an aboveline deduction for health insurance a tax deduction okay well we know that there are 42 million or so americans now that do not have health insurance now these are working people because if one is really poor and one is not working one is eligible for medicaid and the federal government pays for ones health insurance but if one is in a lowincome bracket but one is working or even middleincome bracket it depends and one is working a lot of times ones employer will not provide one with health insurance because maybe i is costing him too much or whatever the reason and one has to go and try to buy ones health insurance on the private market or maybe the employer has some kind of a plan but it is very expensive whatever the reasons these 42 million people are pretty much working people that do not have health insurance on the job or cannot afford to buy it in the private market so what the democrats have been saying what vice president gore and president clinton have been saying let us gradually try to address some of the groups that make up this uninsured we know the largest group is the children we know the second largest group is near elderly people between 55 and 65 that are not eligible for medicare yet these are some of the groups what the democrats have been doing and we actually did get the support of the republicans eventually we had to drag them along on this but we eventually did get the support of the republicans to pass a kids health initiative a couple years ago that gradually has been getting to the point where we think about half of the children that are uninsured will have some sort of insurance with money paid for by the federal government well what vice president gore has been saying is that he wants to increase the income eligibility so that right now if one is say 200 percent of poverty and one is eligible for this kids care program we will raise it to 250 percent of poverty or 300 percent of poverty and try to get more of these lower middle class people who are working and their kids into this chip or kids care program well we found of course that the republican leadership does not want to do that that would have been the logical thing to do in this tax bill would be to expand eligibility for the kid care program or another thing that we could have done and this is another thing that vicepresident gore has proposed and the democrats here in the house is to enroll the parents of those kids in the health insurance program because we know that those parents if they cannot get health insurance for the kids other than through the federal government they are not able to get it for themselves in this tax bill we could have put a provision there for the near elderly what the democrats have been saying is they would like to see the people between 55 and 65 be able to buy into medicare at their own expense they would buy into medicare but no the republican leadership does not want to do any of those things this is what they said they said we are going to give you an aboveline tax deduction i am not going to get into all the details of that but basically that has two problems first of all very few of the people who are now without health insurance who are sort of lower middle class category very few of them will be able to take advantage of this deduction and go out and buy health insurance first of all because most of them do not have incomes where that deduction is significant enough to be able to use it to buy a health insurance policy which in the private market may be 3 000 to 4 000 a year secondly what we find with this aboveline deduction is that it creates a disincentive for employers to provide health insurance as a consequence a lot more employers may decide not to provide health insurance and instead actually increase the ranks of the uninsured the only people that really are able to take advantage of this are people that already have health insurance that are making a decent income and can take advantage of the deduction but if one is trying to increase the number of insured people and take the uninsured off the rolls this accomplishes virtually nothing it just helps people who are in a higher income bracket and who already have health insurance again it sounds so critical the republican leadership brought up this bill yesterday or the day beforewhen they brought it out here and they said we are going to try to do all these things we want to address some of the health care concerns of the american public with this bill but whether it is the question of the uninsured it is ineffective whether it is the question of addressing the prescription drug prices it is ineffective because it does not provide any guarantees one is going to get prescription drugs under any kind of hmo plan certainly it does not even address the effort to reform the hmos with the patients bill of rights that the democrats have been talking about so i just want to say once again we see the republican leadership aligned with the special interests the drug companies the hmos the health insurance companies not doing anything that is going to help the average american now i wanted to talk a little bit because i think it is important i mentioned before earlier that there are three major health care issues that are not being addressed by this congress we only have a few more days every one of these issues could have been addressed and could have come to the floor the democrats have been pushing for them for these issues and for legislation to address these concerns to come to the floor it appears in the dying days of this congress that these issues are simply not going to be addressed they should be it is not fair it does not address the concerns of the average american now the first one i want to talk about is the patients bill of rights hmo reform we know from our own constituents i can certainly say for my constituents that one of the biggest problems people face is if they are in an hmo oftentimes they are denied access to the care that they need that their physician says that they need now that may be the individual who goes to the hospital and finds that the doctor says to them that they need to stay a couple extra days in the hospital after recuperating from a particular operation or it may be the individual who has the need for a particular operation and the hmo says they are not going to pay for it they are not going to cover it there are so many situations there are situations where people their hmo plans say that they cannot go to the local hospital they have to go to a hospital 50 miles away they may be in a situation where they want to go to the local emergency room and they have to go to the one 50 miles away otherwise it is not covered these are the kinds of abuses that we see not every day but on a fairly regular basis a lot of people come to my office and complain about these things now what the democrats said is well we want to address these abuses generally the plan that the democrats put forth with some republicans the patients bill of rights the norwooddingell bill has two major ways of correcting the abuses in sort of an overall sense one is that it provides that if a decision has to be made about what kind of care one is going to get that that decision rather than being made by the insurance company is made by the physician and the patient the definition if you will of what ismedically necessary the hospital stay the particular operation of what is medically necessary is made by the physician and the patient and not by the insurance company the second thing it does in a broad sense is the patients bill of rights says that if one is denied care because the insurance company says one cannot have that operation for example then one has to have an ability to redress that grievance the patients bill of rights does it in essentially two ways one it siys that one can go to a board outside the jurisdiction or outside of the umbrella of the hmo an independent review board that will look at the case and decide whether the hmo made the wrong decision in denying one that care absent that or sort of an appeal from the review board is that one can go to court and one can bring suit these are really very simple things basically what happened here is that the democratic leadership the vice president the president got together and we were able to get some republicans on the other side initiated by republicans that were physicians the gentleman from georgia the gentleman from iowa and some others to join us and put together the patients bill of rights the norwooddingell bill the republican leadership opposed it the republican leadership did not want to bring it to the floor we went out and got a discharge petition which is a way of coming up to the well here october 27 2000 and getting almost a majority of the members to sign a petition saying we want it brought to the floor the republican leadership eventually brought it to the floor it passed with almost every democrat and maybe a third of the republicans it went over to the senate where it was killed by the senators who will not even let it come out of conference between the two houses but again this is an important piece of legislation just as important as a prescription drug benefit under medicare just as important as trying to address the problems of the uninsured and we find that the republican leadership in this house of representatives simply will not let any of these good measures move forward they have stopped them and they are still stopping them in the waning hours of this congress i see i have been joined this evening by two of my colleagues who have been out front on all of these issues over the last 2 years and even bey ond that and i am very pleased to see them here i will first yield to my colleague from texas who has done so many things but i think probably the best example i saw was the period of time in his district where he spoke to the different senior groups and had them bring in their prescription drugs and tell him about the problems that they faced with prescription drugs and actually brought the pill bottles down here and suggested the rest of us do the same and we very dramatically showed along with the gentleman from texas about what kind of problems the average senior faces in texas and in all of our districts so i yield to the gentleman from texas at this point"], [0.001365959644317627, 0.9986340403556824, 1, "i originally voted for this bill but only very reluctantly i will not vote to override the presidents veto i am not voting to sustain the veto because i oppose estatetax relief for familyowned ranches and farms or other small businesses in fact i definitely think we should act to make it easier for their owners to pass them on to future generations this is important for the whole country or course but it is particularly important for coloradans who want to help keep ranch lands in open undeveloped condition by reducing the pressure to sell them to pay estate taxes but there is a better way to do it than by enacting this republican bill that is why i voted for the democratic alternative when the house originally considered this bill that democratic alternative bill would have provided real effective relief without the excesses of the republican bill it would have raised the estate taxs special exclusion to 4 million for a couple owning a farm or small business so under that alternative a married couple owning a family farm or ranch or a small business worth up to 4 million could pass it on intact with no estate tax whatsoever also the democratic alternative actually would have provided more immediate relief to small business and farm owners unlike the republican billwhich is phased in over 10 yearsthe democratic alternative would have taken effect immediately that means a couple passing on their farm or small business in the near future would avoid more tax under the democratic plan than under the republican bill they would not have to hope to live long enough to see the benefits in addition by increasing the general exclusion from 675 000 to 1 1 million next year the democratic alternative would have allowed parents to pass on millionaire status to their children without a penny of estate tax burden and the democratic alternative also would have lowered estate tax rates by 20 across the board so the democratic alternativewhich i voted for which deserved adoption and which would not have been vetoedwould have provided important relief from the estate tax and would have done so in a real effective and prompt way furthermore the democratic alternative would have provided this relief in a fiscally responsible way that would not jeopardize our ability to do what is needed to maintain and strengthen social security and medicare provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and pay down the public debt by contrast it is precisely the fiscal overkill of the republican bill that made me most reluctant to vote for it and that leads me to vote to sustain the presidents veto as the rocky mountain news put it in a september 3rd editorial the republican tax cut is a gamble that the present economic boom isnt going to slow and is fiscally irre mr lantos i will vote today sponsible to uphold the presidents veto of the estate once fully phased in the republican bill tax elimination act would forgo nearly 50 billion a year in rev when this legislation was first considered in enue with no guarantee that this revenue loss the house in june i strongly supported and will not harm social security and medicare in voted for the democratic alternative which was future years presented by congressman rangel of new the bills sponsors say it will cost 28 2 bil york that proposal called for a significant relion over 5 years and 104 5 billion over 10 duction in the rate of taxation of estates and years but that is far from the whole story be a 50 percent increase in the small business cause of the way the bill is phased in its true exclusion the rangel proposal was a cost is cleverly hidden and does not show up thoughtful and reasonable effort to deal with until after the 10year budget window the legitimate concerns of small businesses that means the full effects of the repub and family farms but it did not have the problican bill will come just at the time when we lems of the legislation which was being urged will have to face budget pressures because by the republican majority my own baby boom generation is starting to when the rangel substitute was defeated retire and if we feel we need to phase in by the house i nevertheless voted for the h r 8 because we cannot afford the full re adoption of h r 8 in order to continue the legpeal now how are we ever going to afford it islative process initial senate action was 10 years from now much closer to the rangel substitute and i we do not need to engage in this fiscal expected a housesenate conference comoverkill mittee to produce a bill that i could support according to the treasury department unfortunately the senate simunder current law only 2 of all decedents ply accepted the flawed version of the bill as have enough wealth to be subject to the es adopted by the house and did not make those tate tax at all changes that would improve the legislation to be more specific the treasury depart president clinton was right to veto this bill ment tells me that in 1997 estatetax returns and i will vote to sustain that veto were filed for only 297 coloradans i urge my colleagues in the furthermore according to the treasury de republican leadership of this house to work partment of those estates that are affected by with the democratic leadership and with the the estate tax only 30 that is only 6 in president to craft legislation that deals with the 10 000 american estateswere comprised legitimate problems of estate taxation and that primarily of familyowned small businesses provides the relief small businesses need we ranches or farms need to deal with legitimate problems with the looking just at our state that means that in federal estate tax but this bill is clearly the 1997 fewer than a dozen estatetax returns wrong way to do that"], [0.001374363899230957, 0.998625636100769, 1, "i thank the gentleman from maine for yielding i want to thank the gentleman from arkansas for allowing me to step up before him for a second because i do have to leave i thought i wanted to come here this evening and talk with all the others that think this is an important issue i want to take a little leave from the prepared remarks that i had to compliment the gentleman from maine for the leadership that he has shown on this to let people know it goes beyond just filing the bill the gentleman from maine and i shared time on the committee on government reform which unfortunately under its current leadership has been wasting a lot of time on issues that apparently are not getting that committee too far into anything concrete the gentleman from maine has understood that that committee has great progress in line it has great potential and he has taken on an issue here that is important to the american people and is what that committee ought to be doing on a regular basis so i commend the gentleman from maine for stepping forward on that shortly after the gentleman from maine did his study he was kind enough to share it i did another study after the gentleman from texas did his and the gentleman from arkansas did his it was one of those succeeding studies that sort of went domino effect right across the country as we have heard mentioned here the results in my district were no different than they were in others seniors that are not covered in a large plan are paying an extraordinary high amount for prescription drugs this whole health care system that we have is imploding at the current time we said this in 1993 and 1994 we told people then that if we did not do something about the systemic problems that we had in our health care delivery system we were going to find that managed care companies would take every ounce of profit that they had out of it squeeze it out and hand back to the american people a problem essentially that is happening in large part and aggravating that situation is the huge cost of prescription drugs the cost to managed care systems themselves the cost to hospitals and the cost to individuals that are not covered on a plan large enough to drive a lower price the gentleman from maine and i have both heard the prescription drug manufacturing companies come out and tell us that this is cost fixing price fixing we both smiled at that because we know it is the exact opposite of that they do not have a free market system in fact the prescription drug companies are running monopolies they have patents on those drugs and they are determining the prices on them they are discriminating in two different ways that we found out through our reports overseas where people have universal or single payer health care or they have some system to buy en gros for people they are driving the prices down and then that cost is being made up that profit for the company made up by shifting the higher costs to people that are not covered in this country then within this country people that are covered in plans get a lower price because the plan is large enough to bargain and that cost is then shifted onto those that are not in that position we need to have the majority understand that this is not a partisan issue they have made it a partisan issue the fact that we can have 111 or 112 sponsors to a bill and none of them be from the majority party when it is a bill that talks to an issue that the american people speak about every day and there is not one person that is going to speak here this evening that is not going to say that they took the studies and reports in their district and went to seniors and went to others in their district and talked about it received a tremendous response from people who have said that has been an issue for years we are glad that congress is listening something has to be done now obviously what has to be done is medicare has to include prescription drugs in that program in long range and that i hope will come to fruition at some point this time in the interim the gentleman from maine has had the foresight to put this bill together and i have been fortunate enough to cosponsor it and move it forward to allow people to have the benefit of the federal supply system strangely enough well it is not really strange it is no coincidence at all that the gentleman from maine is a cosponsor of significant campaign finance reform as am i and most of the other people that will speak here this evening amazingly in the early 1990s when many products were lifted and allowed states to buy under the federal supply system originally prescription drugs were on that list consequently by the end of that fall when the appropriations bill was done there was a single sentence in there that took prescription drugs out so now prescription drug companies make 28 percent profit in some instances other companies in the fortune 500 would be happy to have 10 percent profits nobody is saying we do not want them to have profits they have been the top 20 profitable companies across the world in the last years we want them to make a profit we do not want them to shift the responsibility to the most vulnerable part of this population we need to improve our health care system we need to make sure that people can do it and when we get through with this bill when it passes i am hoping we move on and allow legislation to pass to take away any impediments anything that would stand in the way of states or entire regions of this country joining together to get their prescription drugs at even lower prices we can put in protections for the manufacturers to make sure that their prices are not driven down worldwide but we have to make sure that we move in that direction let me leave the gentleman from maine with one story that we have shared and that i think drives it home there is a woman in my district who lives in newburyport massachusetts who wrote a letter and then she shared it later with the newspaper and the letter begins i am sitting at my desk with an involuntary flow of tears streaming down my cheeks my husband sits close by silently eating his heart out i am angry i am distraught i am feeling extremely defenseless she goes on to say my husband just returned from the drugstore when i read the receipt i felt a sense of panic and my eyes welled up 250 this has to be a mistake no it is 250 but how can that be we just paid 400 two weeks ago we cannot keep on doing this our income tax return bailed us out last time now what i took a quick mental inventory of our financial status our one credit card is maxed our bankruptcy prevents us from obtaining a loan we are living paycheck to paycheck we have overdraft but when that is exhausted what will we do i have no aces in the hole all i have left is hope and prayer what people like her are hoping and praying is that congress will not make this a partisan issue congress will understand that we are here not to waste time as the committee on government reform does all too often it is here to act on legislation that is important to the american people legislation like h r 664 again i congratulate the gentleman from maine for bringing this matter to the attention of the congress and helping us getting it passed"], [0.0013913512229919434, 0.9986086487770081, 1, "i yield myself 22 minutes this bipartisan bill our republican colleagues have put on the floor reminds me of a great story a fellow went into a restaurant and asked for stew he was delivered stew and he said oh thats the worst i ever had where did you get it whats the recipe they said its easy its horse and rabbit stew he said what is the recipe for it its the worst ive ever had they said its equal one parts horse and one rabbit well that is kind of what we have here it is bipartisan three democrats support this outrage the rest of the democrats oppose it this is a republican bill that our republican colleagues have finally decided they would put on the floor after the pollsters told them that they are in serious trouble on their opposition to something that the people want and the people need and that is good for the country that is what is at stake there is a very simple difference between the two bills one is that the democratic bill helps seniors to get insurance coverage the republican bill only offers to subsidize insurance companies if they can find an insurance company that happens to want some more money now having said that the democratic bill also sees to it that senior citizens and medicare recipients get their pharmaceuticals at affordable prices the republican bill gives money to insurance companies to maybe pay to pharmaceutical houses so that both can make more money if they decide they want it that is what is at stake here now man and boy i have been in this place for a long time i have never seen a worse process than we are confronted with today the speaker says how he would like this to be bipartisan well so would we but it is not apparently however our republican colleagues want this to be a partisan process but i am not surprised because this has been going on this whole session and it is not something that we have not seen before i would just make another little observation for the benefit of my republican colleagues i have watched my republican colleagues going back to 1935 when the social security bill was enacted the republicans opposed enactment of the social security act and they fought it for everything they were worth my republican colleagues also opposed medicare and by and large with the exception of 68 courageous decent men they opposed the patients bill of rights they have also opposed universal coverage of people under health insurance again something that is desperately needed so this is not new what we are observing is the republicans are again looking after their rich buddies and seeing to it that the people who need help are going to get nothing and i will simply point out there are few who will draw any significant benefits under this piece of legislation it is a sham a fraud and an outrage and it is almost as bad as the process under which we function today it is a sham a fraud and an outrage and it is almost as bad as the grossly unfair process under which we function today a process which denies the people of the united states a vote on a meaningful bill which really meets the needs of our retirees and which does not simply benefit insurance companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers medicare is one of our most successful social programs in history it insures more than 39 million disabled and senior americans and has drastically reduced poverty and improved the health of our elderty over the years congress has enacted a number of additions to the program including coverage for physicians services and coverage of certain preventive benefits now the house is being denied an opportunity to debate seriously the most significant program change in recent timethe addition of a prescription drug benefit to the program the private insurance market was not willing to provide meaningful dependable coverage for seniors and the disabled in 1965 that is why we created medicare today the private market is failing to provide seniors with adequate coverage for prescription drugs we all know the important role prescription drugs play in our lives and they are particularly important for seniors or the disabled yet three out of five medicare beneficiaries lack dependable coverage those without coverage are forced to pay for medically necessary drugs quit of their own fixed incomes and too many forgo medications that will keep them healthy out of the hospital and living longer more productive lives what this congress does with regard to a medicare prescription drug benefit will have a profound impact on americas seniors and disabled unfortunately the republican leaderships prescription drug proposal would break the promise that congress made to americas seniors and the disabled over three decades ago instead of providing an entitlement to a guaranteed affordable defined benefit the republican drug bill is a sham and a scam the republican leaderships prescription drug proposal relies on private sector insurance companies to deliver a benefit these are the same companies that failed to provide adequate health insurance to seniors thirtyfive years ago and the same companies that are saying now the republican proposal just wont work for the first time in medicares history seniors and the disabled would not be guaranteed access to a standard benefit instead they would be limited to whatever private insurance plans decided to sell precription drug policies in their area private plans could vary their benefits vary their costsharing and vary their networks of pharmacies there would be no guarantee that the particular drug plan a senior needed would be available to them and there would be no guarantee that a drug plan that a senior picked one year would be available the next year unfortunately we will not be allowed to vote for a real benefit the democratic substitute would have provided a guaranteed affordable prescription drug coverage for every single senior and disabled person in medicare whether they live in miami ohio or miami florida seniors would be guaranteed the same benefit at the same premium the democratic substitute would guarantee seniors and the disabled access to the medically necessary drugs their doctor prescribes and it would guarantee that they could continue to get their medication from their local pharmacist finally the democratic substitute should provide sufficient subsidies so that the benefit would remain affordable to all that is why the republican leadership will not even allow the house to vote on our substitute members of congress dont have a choice before them today we must reject a bill that would undermine all the principles that has made medicare the most successful social program in history and we will need to wait for another day or another congress to vote for a package that provides a real drug benefit in the medicare program"], [0.0013929009437561035, 0.9986070990562439, 1, "i sit on the committee on the judiciary i would like to respond to the issue of the latino immigration fairness act and the authorizing committee we made every effort to respond to this issue in the authorizing committee but we were denied by the republican majority i would like to support this legislation it is an important piece of legislation but i think it is important to reunite families the same as we did for eastern european families a few years ago this legislation now is the only vehicle to be able to answer the concerns of haitians hondurans and guatemalans and others who were left out we need parity in addition this is the only vehicle that we can support the hate crimes legislation that has been denied to many states in this country i think james byrd jr s heinous murderous deceased condition obviously warrants us passing both the hate crimes legislation and as well this legislation with the immigration fairness act included i ask for my colleagues to vote against this legislation i rise to express my outrage that this house has brought forth the important commercejusticestate conference report to be voted on yet the republican leadership has not felt the need or importance to include language to address the dreadful acts of hate crimes this move by the republican leadership is a slap in the face to the many people here in the united states who have historically been subjected to hateful acts resulting in death bodily harm as well as mental and physical anguish only due to a persons race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we as elected representatives for the american people ignore our duty to ensure that all people are treated equally how can we ignore our moral oath to protect people from hateful acts that arise because of a person race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we allow hateful skeletons of this countrys past to be revived and allowed to infect our society today this chambers silence on the need for hate crimes legislation would do just that and the absence of hate crimes language in the cjs conference report sends the message that this countrys stance on crimes of hate is not a top priority this issue is very dear to me and i am ashamed that after two years from the date of james bryd juniors vicious murder on a paved road in my home state of texas that a bipartisan hate crimes prevention act has not become law time and time again i have come to the floor and asked the republican leadership to support meaningful hate crimes legislation i have introduced my own hate crimes legislation and have supported legislation and resolutions introduced by my colleagues in both the house and the senate yet i find myself coming before the american people once again to compel the republican leadership to include hate crimes language in the cjs conference report in order to increase penalties on perpetrators of hate crimes before the 106th congress comes to a close the same tactics that have been used in the texas state legislature to run out the time in the legislative session to defeat the passage of hate crimes legislation have been used here in the united states congress as well when the james byrd jr hate crimes act was introduced in my home state of texas in january 1999 it was hastily defeated in the state senate and when state democrats attempted to negotiate with republicans in the state senate and the governors administration to get a bipartisan hate crimes bill passed political games were played to extend the process until the end of the state legislative session as i have stated this political ploy was not only used in my home state of texas but it has been used here in both chambers of the united states congress as well we have attempted to negotiate with members of the republican party to get hate crimes legislation passed within the 106th congress however political games and wizardry have been used to delay the process until the congressional session comes to an end i therefore call on the republican leadership with the american people as my witnesses to once again ask for the passage of hate crimes legislation to address senseless killings and crimes of hate and to make a statement that the united states will no longer tolerate these acts since james byrd juniors death our nation has experienced an alarming increase in hate violence directed at men women and even children of all races creeds and colors ronald taylor traveled to the eastside of pittsburgh in what has been characterized as an act of hate violence to kill three and wound two in a fast food restaurant eight weeks later in pittsburgh richard baumhammers armed with a 357caliber pistol traveled 20 miles across the west side of pittsburgh where he killed five people his shooting victims included a jewish women an indian vietnamese chinese and several black men the decade of the 1990s saw an unprecedented rise in the number of hate groups preaching violence and intolerance with more than 50 000 hate crimes reported during the years 1991 through 1997 the summer of 1999 was dubbed the summer of hate as each month brought forth another appalling incident commencing with a threeday shooting spree aimed at minorities in the midwest and culminating with an attack on mere children in california from 1995 through 1999 there has been 206 different arson or bomb attacks on churches and synagogues throughout the united statesan average of one house of worship attacked every week like the rest of the nation some in congress have been tempted to dismiss these atrocities as the anomalous acts of lunatics but news accounts of this homicidal fringe are merely the tip of the iceberg the beliefs they act on are held by a far larger though less visible segment of our society these atrocities illustrate the need for continued vigilance and the passage of the hate crimes prevention act it is long past the time for congress to pass a comprehensive law banning such atrocities it is a federal crime to hijack an automobile or to possess cocaine and it ought to be a federal crime to drag a man to death becauseof his race or to hang a person because of his or her sexual orientation these are crimes that shock and shame our national conscience and they should be subject to federal law enforcement assistance and prosecution therefore i would urge my fellow members of the united states congress and the american people to be counted among those who will stand for justice in this country for all americans and nothing else we must address the problem of hate crimes before the 106th congress convenes its legislative business"], [0.0013944506645202637,

republican leadership continues to let the issue languish we still have no indication when or even if they will allow the patients bill of rights to come to the house floor for a vote the reason for this activity is the same asit was last year the republican leadership cannot figure out how they can pass a good managed care bill without alienating the insurance agency so instead of doing what is right and best for the american people they are once again appeasing the insurance industry and hoping an answer to this problem will magically fall from out of the sky unfortunately as the leadership sits and waits and does nothing the shortcomings of the system continue to forever change the lives of countless americans we need only to turn on the tv or open the newspaper to see this i would like to use one example here tonight and that is the issue of emergency room care earlier this month usa today ran an editorial on this issue it was called early last year starts the editorial it mentions that a seattle woman began suffering chest pains and numbness while driving the pain was so severe that she pulled into a fire station seeking help only to be whisked to the nearest hospital where she was promptly admitted to most that would seem a prudent course of action but not to her health plan it denied payment because she did not call the plan first to get preauthorized according to an investigation by the washington state insurance commissioner i mentioned this editorial as an example of the problems people have with their hmos in terms of access and paying to for emergency room care let me just go on to talk about this editorial again the editorial says that this incident is typical of the enumerable bureaucratic hassles patients confront as hmos and other managed care companies attempt to control costs but denial of payment for emergency care presents a particularly dangerous doublewhammy patients facing emergencies might feel they have to choose between putting their health at risk and paying a huge bill they may not be able to afford the editorial in usa today goes on to suggest a solution to the problem noting that a national prudent layperson standard law covering all health plans would help fill in the gaps left by the current patchwork of state and federal laws democrats have been basically making this point about managed care for a long time we know that people have had problems with their hmos if they need to use an emergency room either because they are told to go to a hospital emergency room a lot further away from where they live or where the accident occurred or as in this case that i just mentioned the actual payment afterwards is denied because they did not seek preauthorization which seems nonsensical certainly in the context of emergency room care one only goes to an emergency room if it is an emergency if one has to get preauthorization for it it really is not an emergency that is the dilemma that more and more americans face that their hmo plan does not cover emergency room care the democrats in response to this have introduced a bill called the patients bill of rights basically what we do in the patients bill of rights is say that the prudent laypersons standard applies in other words if the average person the average prudent person if you will decided that they had chest pains or they had a problem that necessitated going to the local emergency room then they can go to the emergency room that is closest by and the hmo has to pay has to compensate for that care has to pay for that emergency room care in the last congress we the democrats tried to bring up the patients bill of rights the patients bill of rights provides a number of patient protections not just the emergency room care but access to specialists it basically applies the principle that says if particular care is necessary medically necessary and in the opinion of ones doctor is medically necessary then it is covered and the hmo has to cover that particular type of care in the last congress the republican leadership did not hold a single hearing on the patients bill of rights or even on an alternative managed care bill that they had proposed so what we had to do basically was to seek what we call a discharge petition we had to have a number of our colleagues come down to the well here and sign a discharge petition that said that the patients bill of rights should be allowed to come to the floor as we reached the magical number that was necessary in order to bring the patients bill of rights to the floor the republican leadership finally decided that they would bring their own managed care reform bill to the floor in the context of that we were allowed to bring up the patients bill of rights i think we are going to have to be forced to do that again basically in this session of congress even though the patients bill of rights have been reintroduced and even though there are some republican managed care reform proposals so far the republican leadership has refused to bring up hmo reform either their bill which is not as good or the patients bill of rights the democratic bill so what we have had to do again and starting tomorrow is to file a rule allowing for a discharge petition to be brought up and have as many members of congress come down to the well again in a couple of weeks and sign this discharge petition in order to force the republican leadership to bring the patients bill of rights to the floor it should not be that way it should not be necessary that in order to achieve hmo reform that we have to sign a petition as members of congress to bring it up it simply should be brought up in committee there should be hearings it should be voted on in committee to come to the floor but so far we have nothing but stalling tactics from the republican leadership i mentioned the example of emergency room care but there are a lot of other examples that we can mention about why we need patient protections why we need the patients bill of rights let me just give my colleagues another example though we have a democratic task force on health care which basically put together the patients bill of rights we had some hearings on the patients bill of rights in the context of our democratic health care task force because we could not get hearings in the regular committees of the house because of the opposition from the republican leadership i just wanted to mention another example because i think it is one of the most egregious that came before us when we had this hearing we invited a dr charlotte yeh who is a practicing emergency physician at the new england medical center in boston to the hearing that we had she provided a number of examples of the effects that the managed care industries approach to emergency room care is having on patients including one from boston she told our task force about a boy whose leg was seriously injured in an auto accident at a nearby hospital in boston emergency room doctors told the parents he would need vascular surgery to save his leg and that a surgeon was ready at that hospital to perform the operation unfortunately for this young man his insurer insisted he be transferred to an innetwork hospital for the surgery his parents were told if they allowed the operation to be done anywhere else they would be responsible to the bill they agreed to the move surgery was performed 3 hours after the accident by then it was too late to save the boys leg dr yeh went on to express her very strong support to making the prudent laypersons standard the national standard for emergency room care as i said before basically the prudent laypersons standard says if one does go to the emergency room to seek treatment under conditions that would prompt any reasonable person to go there ones hmo would pay for it but in addition to the prudent laypersons standard dr yeh also emphasized the need to eliminate restrictive prior authorization requirements and the establishment of poststabilization services between emergency physicians and managed care plans the patients bill of rights includes all of these types of provisions if i could for a minute just run through some of the protections that are included in the patients bill of rights it guarantees access to needed health care specialists very important it provides as i said access to emergency room services when and where the need arise it provides continuity of care protections to assure patient care if a patients health care provider is dropped it gives access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process let me mention that for a minute if one is denied care right now because ones hmos decides that they will not pay for it one of the things that my constituents complain to me about is that they have no way to appeal that decision other than internally within the hmo so if the hmo decides for example that a particular type of treatment is not medically necessary or that one does not have to stay in the hospital a couple more days even though ones doctor thinks that one should be staying there or a number of other things that they consider not medically necessary well most of the times under current law there is no appeal other than to the hmo itself and they of course routinely deny the appeal because for them it is largely a cost issue what we are saying in the patients bill of rights is that that person should be able to go to an external appeal someone outside the hmo or a panel outside the hmo that would review the case and decide whether or not that care should be provided and paid for by the hmo in addition what we say is that if one has been damaged for some reason god forbid that one needed some kind of procedure or one needed to stay in the hospital a few more days and the hmo refused to allow that and as a result one suffered injury and damage then one should be able to bring suit in a court of law and recover for those damages most people do not realize that option does not exist today for a lot of people who are in hmo plans because the federal government has said that in the case of people covered by a federal plan or where the federal government has usurped or preempted the state law for those who are mostly selfinsured by their employer that there is no recourse to seek damages in a court of law that is not right it is not right someone should be able to sue for damages and sue the hmo if they have been denied care and if they have been hurt or damaged as a result of that just to mention a couple more things we also have in the patients bill of rights we assure that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment options because oftentimes hmos tell the doctors they cannot tell about treatment options that are not covered the socalled gag rule we assure that women have direct access to an ob gyn as i said we provide an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been maimed or die as a result of health plan actions there are a lot more things that we can go into and we will tonight but i yield to the gentlewoman from texas"], [0.00139540433883667,

fact i definitely think we should act to make it easier for their owners to pass them on to future generations this is important for the whole country of course but it is particularly important for coloradans who want to help keep ranch lands in open undeveloped condition by reducing the pressure to sell them to pay estate taxes but we do not need to do all that this republican bill would do in order to make sure the estate tax is no longer too heavy a burden on the small business and farm owners the democratic alternativethe substitute for which i votedwould have provided real effective relief without the excesses of the republican bill that alternative would have raised the estate taxs special exclusion to 4 million for a couple owning a farm or small business so under that alternative a married couple owning a family farm or ranch or a small business worth up to 4 million could pass it on intact with no estate tax whatsoever also the democratic alternative actually would have provided more immediate relief to small business and farm owners unlike the republican billwhich is phased in over ten yearsthe democratic alternative would have taken effect immediately that means a couple passing on their farm or small business in the near future would avoid more tax under the democratic plan than under the republican bill they would not have to hope to live long enough t6 see the benefits in addition by increasing the general exclusion now at 675 000 to 1 1 million next year the democratic alternative would allow for any person to pass on millionaire status to their children without a penny of estate tax burden and the democratic alternative also would lower estate tax rates by 20 across the board so the democratic alternativewhich i voted for and which deserved adoptionwould provide important relief from the estate tax and would have done so in a real effective and prompt way furthermore the democratic alternative would have provided this relief in a fiscally responsible way that would not jeopardize our ability to do what is needed to maintain and strengthen social security and medicare provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and pay down the public debt by contrast it is precisely the fiscal overkill of the republican bill that makes me most reluctant to vote for it once fully phased in the republican bill would forgo nearly 50 billion a year in revenue with no guarantee that this revenue loss will not harm social security and medicare in future years the bills sponsors say it will cost 28 2 billion over 5 years and 104 5 billion over 10 years but that is far from the whole story because of the way the bill is phased in its true cost is cleverly hidden and does not show up until after the 10year budget window that means the full effects of the republican bill will come just at the time when we will have to face budget pressures because my own baby boom generation is starting to retire and if we feel we need to phase in h r 8 because we cannot afford the full repeal now how are we ever going to afford it 10 years from now we do not need to engage in this fiscal overkill according to the treasury department under current law only 2 of all decedents have enough wealth to be subject to the estate tax at all to be more specific the treasury department tells me that in 1997 estatetax returns were filed for only 297 coloradans furthermore according to the treasury department of those estates that are affected by the estate tax only 30 that is only 6 in 10 000 american estateswere comprised primarily of familyowned small businesses ranches or farms looking just at our state that means that in 1997 fewer than a dozen estatetax returns were comprised primarily of small businesses ranches or farms of course those numbers only relate to the cases in which an estate tax was actually paid clearly in many other cases families have taken actions to forestall the estate tax i understand that and do think that in appropriate cases we should lessen the pressure that prompted some of those actions as i said the democratic alternative would have provided real effective and immediate estatetax relief to the owners of small businesses including farms and ranches and would have done so in a fiscally responsible way that is why i voted for it in contrast the biggest beneficiaries of the republican legislation are not those middleclass families who own small ranches or farms or other small businesses but instead are very wealthy families with very large assets over the past two decades income and wealth disparities have increased the republican bill while it does have some positive aspects would increase those wealth disparities i find this troubling and it adds to my reluctance to support the bill however i will vote for the bill because the republican leadership has made it clear that it is this bill or no estatetax relief bill at least for now here in the house that being the case i have decided that the republican billalthough very flawed and excessive is just acceptable enough for me to vote for today i do so in the hope and expectation that the bills faults can be corrected as it proceeds through the legislative process and that ultimately it can be refined into a bill that deserves to be enacted into law if that does not occur if that hope and expectation prove unfoundedi

right some two sessions ago the legislative team or the legislative body and houses of the state of texas passed a bipartisan patients bill of rights and one that has been effective in assisting the individuals of my state in better health care we can always do better however i think to follow up on the gentlemans line of reasoning about the discharge petition i think it is important to note just what that means the discharge petition is something that most members would rather not have to procedurally utilize it is reallya cry of anguish and frustration as well as an emphasis on the national if you will priority that the issue deserves we have done it with campaign finance reform which the american people over and over again have indicated that it is high time to get special interests out of politics we are now doing it and have done it in the past with the patients bill of rights because we have seen the response by the american people in fact i just recently saw about 2 weeks ago a poll done that indicated the high level of frustration with hmos by the american people just an enormous amount of frustration not with the physicians who have already said get the business or the insurance companies out of my hypocritic oath if i have it correct in their phraseology let me be a physician a nurturer but the american people have now spoken so this discharge petition is a response to the fact that we have a crisis we have a road of no return we have no light at the end of the tunnel the american people are over and over speaking about the need to be able to make personal decisions about their health care with their physicians we already understand the value of efficiency we already under the value of making sure that we do not wastefully spend monies that are not necessary unnecessary procedures or unnecessary equipment if you will i can think of a box of tissues that showed up on a bill more than 10 times or so we have already gone through that i think the american people the congress has addressed the question of waste so waste is not the issue the issue is what kind of care are we giving our patients and those who work every day and deserve health care i think that there is something so pivotal to the relationship and the confidence that people would have in their hmos and their health care and that is to be able to go somewhereand say doctor i have a pain to the emergency room i have a severe pain and being considered legitimate in ones expression the democratic patients bill of rights allows for severepain to be established as a legitimate reason to be able to go to the emergency room why is this so very important my colleague already evidenced where there was a situation where there was an accident and a tragedy occurred where a young mans leg could have been saved if they only had not shipped him from one place to the other 3 hours later what about a situation where it is not visible that there is something very tragic happening my example that i offer to my colleagues is not the same but a very outstanding member of our committee someone who did not think that they were sick and went with their spouse to the emergency room drove themselves and walked up to the emergency room which was not a familiar emergency room not one maybe in their neighborhood experiencing pain and they had to sit down now this is not directly but it shows what happens when we have delayed circumstances with hospitals because they are checking on their hmo rather than the ability to go to the nearest emergency room because of an expressed pain and of course they had to take time checking whether they were at the right place lo and behold that individual had a massive cardiac arrest and did not survive the tragedy of the family having to be delayed with paperwork where is your identification do you belong here realizing that they had some coverage but they had to detail whether they were at the right location the patients bill of rights that we as democrats are offering deals with these kinds of delays because it provides them the opportunity to be at almost any emergency room if they have a severe pain and they can be covered i listened as there were discussions on the floor of the house earlier about the values between the democrats and the republicans more particularly the republican party i want to remind the gentleman from new jersey that we are always to be counted upon i believe when there are crises around survival i am reminded of franklin delano roosevelt and social security social security now is the infrastructure is the backbone of survival for our senior citizens i am very proud that a democratic president saw that it was crucial to deal with this issue and it has survived lyndon baines johnson saw the great need in providing senior citizens with a basic kind of coverage so that they would have the ability to have good health care medicare and although we are in the midst of trying to fix and extend social security and medicare those two entities have withstood the test of time unfortunately the republican bill dealing with the patients bill of rights does not allow people with chronic conditions to obtain standing referrals our patients bill of rights does the republican bill purports to prohibit gag clauses but in reality does not do such things and that is that they cannot have the ability of doctors talking with doctors about their health care and therefore keeping information away from both the patients and another doctor about what is transpiring with their condition the republican bill does not require plans to collect data on quality our patients bill of rights does and the republican bill does not establish an ombudsman program to help consumers navigate their way through the confusing array of health options available to them the other thing that is so very important to many women who i have met in my district is that it does not whereas ours does the republican bill does not allow women to choose their obgyn as their primary care provider that is key in the private relationship between physician and patients let me say as well in closing to my friend from new jersey i would like to again thank him for consistent and persistent leadership dealing with getting this bill to the floor it is important to let the american people know that we do not bypass procedures i remember 2 or 3 or 4 years ago having hearings out on the lawn about medicare we were so serious about the issue that we decided if we could not get hearings here in the congress that we as democrats would be out on the front lawn we may be relegated to this i know there have been a number of hearings dealing with this particular issue but we have been bogged down by the allegations that we have lifted up this right to sue and medical necessity and that these are issues that are maybe holding us back and i think people should understand that this is not an issue of attack this right to sue this is not to encourage frivolous litigation buteven the physicians who twotoone have supported and are supporting the democratic patients bill of riglhs have said we are sued sometimes we are blocked from giving good health care or providing a specialist because someone far away with a computer is saying you cannot do it why should they be vulnerable and the actual decision was made by an hmo an insurance company or someone looking at the bottom line and not looking at good health care i think america deserves better and i would just simply say that all the people who have been injured all the people who have suffered the loved ones because of countless deaths my fear of an injury being in the united states congress why should i be in fear because it still happens to any one of us that would be confronted with the choices of an emergency room that would say they are not eligible to come in here this is a fear that happens more to our constituents that have no other options i think it is high time that we take the time out as we are moving to discuss passing gun safety laws that should be passed this week i voted against adjourning because we have so many things to be doing it is important that we get the patients bill of rights here to the floor of the house with a vigorous debate i am convinced that we will draw many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle when they see the reasoning of our debate on this issue that a patients bill of rights is only fair for all americans because we deserve and they deserve and frankly this nation deserves the best health care we can possibly give we have got all the talent but we do not have the procedures to allow them to have it i hope our colleagues will sign the discharge petition

surplus other than trust fund surpluses you would not believe that with the carriedaway rhetoric that all of us have been guilty of using of late the 4 6 trillion projected surplus over the next 10 years remember that is projected but more important remember that as of august 31 of this year there still has been no surplus other than trust funds and therefore that is why many of us on this side of the aisle have been arguing that before we spend these projected surpluses that we ought to fix social security and medicare first that we ought to be doing the nations business today instead of adjourning at 3 oclock in the afternoon or completing business at 2 15 we ought to be dealing in the respective committees with how do we fix medicare and the tremendous needs of rural health care why have we been on the floor for the last several weeks talking about tax cuts of 1 3 trillion when you add them all up again spending projected surpluses before we fix social security and medicare again let us calm ourselves and acknowledge the fact that as of august 31 there is no surplus other than trust fund surpluses that is why today the blue dog democrats reiterated the plan that we were talking about at the beginning of this session of congress the same plan that we brought to the floor of the house that got if memory serves me correct 177 votes 144 democrats and i believe 37 republicans joined with us that would be 181 not quite a majority but there was a significant bipartisan group that recognized that you needed a plan if you were going to accomplish all of the rhetoric that both sides take part in from time to time today we come to the floor to discuss in quite some detail the plan that the blue dogs put forward months ago that we reiterate today the blue dog outline demonstrates that it is still possible to reach an agreement on a fiscally responsible budget plan that pays off the debt maintains fiscal discipline and provides substantial tax relief including estate tax relief and marriage penalty repeal the blue dogs have been advocating debt reduction since surplus projections first materialized 2 years ago the republican leadership has adopted blue dog rhetoric in the last few days on debt reduction but only for 1 year and the question we ask today of the leadership of this house is why only 1 year if debt reduction is truly something that we all agree on in a bipartisan way why not do it over a 10year period the blue dogs believe that to be meaningful a commitment to debt reduction must be longterm that is why we are calling on the leadership of this house to extend the principles of their debt reduction lockbox for 10 years under the blue dog framework 3 65 trillion 80 percent of the unified surplus would be devoted to debt reduction over 10 years this would put us on the path to eliminate the publicly held debt by 2010 that is what we say we are for why do we not have policies on this floor that do that which we say why do we continue on having political rallies talking about debt reduction when we really do not mean it except for 1 year that is a question we ask and hopefully someone will come to the floor and answer that question it would be nice to have some simple discussions of these points instead of just one side talking to the other in the absence of the other we will be here by contrast the debt reduction lockbox passed last week would only reserve 60 percent of the unified surplus for debt reduction over the next 10 years blue dogs say 80 republican leadership says 60 and still says we are doing a better job we do not understand that the blue dog framework would result in the budget being balanced without counting any trust funds beginning in 2001 the gentleman from mississippi has been the one that continues to bring the record from treasury source monthly statement of the public debt that anyone can pick up which is what i was talking about when i started my comments today there is no surplus except trust fund surpluses if we are conservative in our approach we can begin paying off the debt without using any of the trust fund surpluses beginning in 2001 if we can only reach an agreement on a 10year debt reduction plan it will establish a foundation that will make it much easier to reach an agreement on significant tax cuts including estate tax relief and repeal of the marriage penalty without jeopardizing fiscal discipline the blue dogs are prepared to work within the 90 10 framework for fiscal year 2001 to balance competing priorities ironically where we have been talking about 50 25 25 for 10 years 90 10 fitg almost exactly with where we believe we ought to be in the year 2001 the blue dogs believe that it is important that congress and the president look beyond the shortterm cost of legislation and keep in mind the longterm impact of budget decisions we make today before agreeing on any tax cuts or new spending programs we need to know how all of these proposals add up over the next 5 to 10 years even if they fit within the 90 10 framework for next year it is important that this congress consider the 10year costs of any tax cuts and new spending initiatives not just the cost in fiscal 2001 likewise once congress and the president agree on the level of discretionary spending for next year and this is what is being fought out it bothered me considerably when i see on the front page of the washington post this morning that members of the other body in the other party are talking about spending is going to go out of the window it should not all we have to do is agree on a framework of what spending should be this year in a bipartisan way working with the white house i believe that is achievable that is the blue dog plan we have looked at the presidents proposals we have looked at the republican budget and we have said somewhere in between is where we need to be close to the middle i think if all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle would look at this proposal we hope they would find the same degree of enthusiasm for it that we bring to the floor today once we get through the 90 10 for 2001 let us talk about the 10 percent how do we propose spending that 10 percent of the projected surplus remember there is no surplus as yet it is projected but we do believe if we stay fiscally conservative with our spending and our taxcutting euphoria that what i am saying today can be achieved we have a projected surplus of 268 billion for fiscal year 2001 ten percent of that is 26 8 billion and that is to be divided between tax cuts and spending divided equally between medicare provider restorations and discretionary spending and tax cuts the blue dog framework would allow a tax cut of 8 5 billion in 2001 and 377 billion over the next 10years this will allow for estate tax and marriage tax penalty relief with room for other tax cuts of 4 4 billion in 2001 and approximately 200 billion over the next 10 years why should we be considering today going home without dealing responsibly with the marriage tax penalty why should we be going home in a few weeks or days without dealing responsibly with the death tax when everyone in this body knows there is a good sound conservative middle ground that would be very appealing to every single small businessman and woman in the united states and give significant relief to everyone above 4 million in estates why would we go home without completing our work devoting an additional 8 5 billion for discretionary spending will provide room to increase spending in the appropriation bills to fund agricultural disaster relief increase funding levels for education health care veterans and military retiree health care all of which have bipartisan agreement that we do need to make some increases in those areas we also provide for 8 5 billion in 2001 to address problems facing health care providers as a result of the reductions of the 1997 balanced budget agreement the kind that our rural hospitals are clamoring praying for the relief so that they do not have to close all of this can be achieved within the framework of debt reduction sincere debt reduction recognizing also that the surpluses that everybody talks about are projected one of the fundamental questions this body should be concerned a little bit about is when we look at this debt that we are talking about onethird of it is owned by foreign interests and the question that we all want to answer i think sooner than later how much longer can our economy continue to grow at the unprecedented rate that it has for the last 8 years how much longer can we go in the longest sustained peacetime economic expansion in the history of our country can we go another 2 months 3 months 6 months 1 year 2 years no one knows the answer to that question but the blue dogs believe that the most conservative thing we can do right now is spend our time discussing how we fix social security and medicare for the future and until we do that let us pay down the debt and let us be very fiscally prudent with the expenditure of our taxpayer dollars that is our message at this point i

california who is chairman of the house committee on rules has been a tireless advocate on behalf of the hightech industry i do not know of anyone who has worked harder invested more time and energy or is more responsible for the bill that we are considering tonight being on the house floor and i would like to congratulate him in advance on the expected passage of this bill second of all the gentleman from utah who just yielded me the time is an active member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims and he too has been a steadfast advocate of the hightech industry the gentleman from utah himself is an entrepreneur and he understands firsthand the needs of the hightech industry although there is still no objective credible study that documents the shortage of american hightech workers the ins said recently that the demand for highly skilled foreign workers is running at least 50 000 ahead of last year such a demand can indicate an actual shortage of american workers a spot shortage a preference for cheap labor or replacement workers or something else but because of the importance of the hightech industry to our economy i think we should give the industry the benefit of the doubt but giving hightech companies the benefit of the doubt is not without risk unless we safeguard american workers we need to recognize the opposition of the american people to an hlb visa increase two major polls demonstrate that the vast majority of americans do not want to see the number of hightech visas increased so much and worry that it will hurt american workers a peter hart poll conducted in march found that 73 percent of americans do not want to see immigration law changed to allow the entry of more foreign hightech workers only 20 percent wanted more foreign workers a harris poll released in september 1998 found that 82 percent of americans do not want to see the hlb quota increased the poll found that 77 percent of americans believe that an increase in hlb visas reduces employment opportunities for american workers and 86 percent of americans believe that unitedstates companies should train unitedstates workers to perform jobs in technical fields even if it is faster and less expensive to fill the jobs with foreign workers to satisfy the concerns of the american people we need to protect american workers from being undercut by foreign workers in the hlb program s 2045 contains no significant provisions to protect these american workers it does not require most companies to make a goodfaith effort to recruit unitedstates workers before hiring foreign workers it allows all but a small handful of firms to lay off american workers and replace the american workers with foreign workers why would anyone oppose these common sense safeguards what amazes me is that in all the discussions i have had with representatives of hightech companies not a single one has expressed any concern about the impact of this legislation on american workers how could anyone oppose a safeguard that says american workers could not be fired and replaced by a foreign worker how could anyone not agree to advertise for american workers before hiring from abroad how could anyone oppose paying foreign workers what the average beginning salary is for american college graduates unless they want to undercut american wages the committee on the judiciary passed a bill h r 4227 that contains an additional crucial safeguard for american workers the committee on the judiciary passed a bill that set a floor on wages for these workers 40 000 per year this wage is a good starting point for any hightech professional it is a salary that american students fresh out of college are making this crucial safeguard would prevent unitedstates companies from hiring foreign workers to undercut the wages of american workers strong antifraud measures are also necessary to address known abuses an article in last thursdays san francisco chronicle says it all federal authorities have started nationwide investigations into the hiring of foreign hightech workers including charges of visa fraud and allegations that the practice is riddled with abuse the chronicle quotes bill yates of the ins as stating but are we catching most of the fraud the truthful answer is that we are not if it is the intention of the employee or the employer to defraud the government you may not be able to ferret it out a justreleased government accounting office report states there is not sufficient assurance that ins reviews are adequate for detecting program noncompliance or abuse the program is vulnerable to abuse both by employers who do not have bona fide jobs to fill or do not meet required labor conditions and by potential workers who present false credentials the goals of preventing abuse of the program and providing efficient services to employers and workers are not being achieved evidence suggests that program noncompliance or abuse by employers may be more prevalent than under other laws any hlb bill should contain effective antifraud measures as are contained in the committee on the judiciarypassed h r 4227 s 2045 contains no such antifraud measures in return for giving hightech companies hundreds of thousands of more foreign workers all we ask on behalf of american workers is some minimal basic common sense safeguards to ensure that businesses do not want to hire cheap foreign workers at the expense of american workers while this bill has taken significant steps to alleviate the presumed shortage with more training for american workers such provisions will not yield benefits for many years supplying future workers is a different issue altogether from shielding todays american workers from the consequences of admitting so many workers

difficult circumstances however i am deeply concerned about a number of programs reduced or eliminated in this bill of greatest concern to me this legislation would terminate most programs under the corporation for national service including americorps as a fiscal conservative i believe national service is one of the wisest and least costly investments our government can make every 1 spent on americorps generates l66 in benefits to the community every fulltime americorps members generates an average of 12 additional volunteers americorps is one of the most successful experiments in state and local controls the federal government has embarked upon twothirds of americorps funding goes directly to the governorappointed state commissions which then make grants to local nonprofits since 1994 more than 150 000 americans have served as americorps members in all 50 states they have taught tutored or mentored more than 2 5 million students recruited supervised or trained more than 1 6 million volunteers built or rehabilitated more than 25 000 homes provided living assistance to more than 208 000 senior citizens and planted more than more than 52 million trees americorps members are not only helping meet the immediate needs in our communities they are also teaching through their example the importance of serving and helping others as a former peace corps volunteer i know the significance of this longlasting lesson our youth want so desperately to take hold of their destiny and work to ensure a brighter and more prosperous future there is so much they can do all they need is the opportunity secondly i am troubled by proposed cuts in the community development block grant program cdbg which would be funded at 4 5 billion a level 300 million below fiscal year 2000 despite a 417 to 8 vote by this house on h r 1776 to increase this programs authorization to 4 9 billion cdbg is the largest source of federal community development assistance to state and local governments it is one of the most flexible most successful programs the federal government administers the cdbg program puts development funds where they can most effectively be allocated in local communities communities may use cdbg money for a variety of community development activities including housing community development economic development and public service activities the bottom line for me in closing is i believe strongly in americorps i regret it is not in the bill i understand why it was not placed in the bill because some members on either side of the aisle will decide to fund veterans programs or some other program and offset it with the national service programs and republicans and democrats alike will vote for a veterans program over this but this program like veterans programs

concerns about the upcoming world trade organization ministerial meeting which will be hosted by the united states in seattle washington from november 30 until the purpose of this meeting is to prepare an agenda for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations aimed at expanding and liberalizing world trade in the wake of the uruguay round of negotiations which ended in 1994 as chairman of the congressional steel caucus i recently convened two days of briefings by unitedstates steel industry executives and the president of the steelworkers of america in addition to discussing the continued threat of lowpriced imports the industry and steelworker representatives also provided the caucus with advice on what should and should not be included ii the agenda which is being drafted in seattle there is general support for this new round of negotiations because liberalized trade has a great potential benefit for the unitedstates economy as long as that liberalized trade is fair and i emphasize the word fair is rulesbased and is market economy based the caucus heard that any future negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization must in no way weaken unitedstates trade laws particularly our antidumping and countervailing duty laws these laws provide essential remedies against unfair foreign imports i am pleased that we have been repeatedly assured by ambassador barshefsky secretary daley and other administration officials that antidumping and countervailing duty statutes will not be reopened in seattle or in any new round of negotiations to follow but we have also heard repeatedly from several of our trading partners that they will seek to reopen discussions on these laws my particular concern arises from an addendum to the wto general council chairman mchurnos draft ministeril declaration for the seattle meeting which he drafted on his own responsibility the proposals in this addendum would seriously weaken the unitedstates antidumping and countervailing duty laws as they stand today although this addendum is not official it indicates that there will be substantial pressure on the unitedstates delegation to include discussions of changes to the antidumping and countervailing duty laws in the new round of negotiations the proposed changes would allow the dumping of goods into the united states and would allow goods to be subsidized by foreign governments these changes in turn would jeopardize united states jobs i will mention just a few of the 24 changes that have been proposed in the mchumo addendum one once an antidumping investigation under unitedstates law is concluded no new petition involving the same product could be initiated for at least a year this means dumping of that product could resume and continue for a year before any remedy could be pursued two if a penalty duty lower than the calculated margin of dumping were thought to be sufficient to reduce the injury then that lower duty would be mandatory even if dumping continues three countervailing duties would be imposed not in the full amount but only in the amount by which the subsidy exceeds the applicable de minimis level four developing countries would suddenly be exempted altogether from the present prohibition on export subsidies and import substitution subsidies these proposed changes sound technical but they would have a dramatic impact on unitedstates jobs in the manufacturing sector and in other important sensitive sectors these changes would mean job losses for many americans and therefore these changes must be resisted i support the viscloskyney resolution stating that the antidumping and antisubsidies code of the wto should not be reopened in seattle i will be part of a delegation travelling to seattle in november as part of the speakers advisory group on the wto ministerial a strong vote in the house and participation by members in the delegation to seattle will be essential in backing up and i say

make it a federal crime to knowingly damage a fertilized egg during an assault against a pregnant mother i now i absolutely agree that it is a tragedy for a woman to lose a pregnancy during a crime and i strongly support the approach that many states have taken to toughen penalties for an assault against a pregnant woman and that is in fact the approach that my colleague is taking in her substitute however h r 2436 would do nothing to protect the woman further but instead would create for the first time a legal definition that a fertilized egg is entitled to protection under the law as a person this bill is indeed breathtaking in its scope while the examples used are drawn from criminal assaults of women in advanced stages of pregnancy its real concern reaches to the impact of the violence on the embryo roe v wade makes a distinction between the embryo in the first trimester and the post viability embryo and that is the distinction that state laws honor this bill makes no such distinction because it deals with the fertilized eggs at all stages of development and therefore it opens the opportunity that if a woman is assaulted in sort of a routine assault and battery case and 3 weeks later has a miscarriage that miscarriage can up the assault and battery charges to murder though she did not know she was pregnant at the time and neither did the assaultant so this bill goes way beyond what it appears to do and while i certainly think that a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy who is assaulted and the fetus killed that assaultant deserves a punishment that is far more severe than if he had not been attacking a pregnant woman i think this bill goes way beyond that by dealing with a fertilized egg and opening up the kinds of possibilities i cite and the next step which is not contained in this bill but it is the only logical next step is to disregard the intent of the assaultant why if it is a criminal assault should it be seen as a crime when it is simply the destruction of the fetus it should not be seen as a crime that is why those of us who support a womans right to abortion are deeply concerned about this legislation it does clearly in its language exclude abortion but the only difference between an abortion and a criminal attack is the criminality of the attacker and the criminal intent but the effect on the fetus is the same and all my colleagues focus on in this bill is the fetal effect and they define fetus as fertilized egg even before the woman knows she is pregnant so i urge opposition to the bill and support for the

the important job they do of educating our children during the past couple of months i have visited 10 or 12 schools in my district and visited the school districts there to sort of find out what they think of the federal role in education the federal role in education usually accounts for about 4 to 8 percent of the budgets of the average school district and i wanted to know if they thought that was helping the answer i got back was yes the money helps but there is too much red tape and there is too much regulation they want greater freedom so that they can exercise their skills and use the teachers and principals and parents and everybody involved in education on the local level there is too much federal red tape and the education flexibility act would target that red tape right now we have a pilot project that allows some 12 states in the country to take advantage of education flexibility this bill would expand it to all 50 states and what it would do is give local school districts the ability to get waivers from those federal regulations but the important thing about education flexibility is that it combines flexibility with accountability which is the way it ought to be done you can get the waiver the local school districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that

spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best

million they are in trouble and so we have to cough up the rest of the bill i would suggest to my colleague that in johnstown pennsylvania he will be run out on a rail the fact is that all we are doing in this amendment is to say when they make a pledge when they say they are going to give 140 million to help kosovo just give it when it is said that we degrade the military by offering this amendment that is total bunk the military does not lose this money in fact the money would give increased readiness because it would say that we do not have to spread ourselves out all over the world the military does not lose anything my colleagues should stand up for their taxpayers because if they do not they are going to come to the town halls and they are going to hold them accountable"]]}
