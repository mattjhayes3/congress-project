from the clintongephardt health plan are middleincome americans sounds familiardoesnt iti believe candidate clinton made a similar pledge about taxes in truth the clintongephardt bill is a bad deal middleincome americans will pay more for less let me repeat that middleincome americans would pay more money for less coverage under clintongephardt if a businessowner wants to be successful and make a profit he will offer his customer more goods or services at a lower price than his competitors but unlike the real world the president thinks he can fool the american people into paying more for less care apparently mr clinton missed the class on basic economics when he was at oxford but isnt this the same president who promised middleincome americans a tax cut and then gave america the greatest tax increase in history thats called a bail and switch lets take a closer look under a clintongephardt system middleincome americans would be forced to buy a governmentsanctioned health care lan regardless of whether they like their current policy or not these families would also be required to purchase benefits many of them quite expensive such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation or abortion benefits that they rpay not need or want under global budgets and spending caps there will be a tremendous amount of costshifting away from medicare and medicaideligible patients to those who have private insurancehospitals and other providers will have little choice the current medicare reimbursement rate is on the average about 59 percent of what private insurers pay for the same procedures or treatment in view of the funding limits and cuts in medicare spelled out in thebill the disparity in reimbursement rates will only widen the bottom line is that middleincome americans will pay the toll through higher premiums higher taxes and less care this entire discussion could really be boiled down to one simple question who pays who pays for creating medicare part c which will expand the total number of medicareeligible individuals to roughly half the entire population who pays for the approximately 170 billion a year in lowincome subsidies provided for in this bill who pays the 2 percent on health in surance premiums who pays for the clintongephardt bill in lost or depressed wages or with their jobs who pays the answer is simplewho pays now for the waste and fraud in our welfare system who always pays the middleincome american according to a study by the american legislative council the average middleincome american worker who earns between 14 000 and 30 000 will lose anywhere from 660 to 2 300 per year in lost wages under a clintongephardttype employer mandate why is that well its something that i dont think many policy wonks in the administration have had much experience withits called meeting a payroll i have had to meet a payroll for more than 30 years now as a small business owner should a clintongephardt mandate be enacted small business owners would be forced to pay 80 percent of the cost of a fortune500 equivalent benefits package whether they can really afford to or not that leaves the small business owner with very few options at the end of the day either reduce the hours employees work reduce their wages or eliminate their jobs altogether to highlight this point an august 8th study by consad research indicates that in my stat of alabama employer mandates in the clintongephardt plan will result in 18 824 people losing their jobs what about the impact on the local economy i dont know about your state but alabama simply cannot absorb job losses of this magnitude in closing let me say to my colleagues and to the american people watching tonight congress cannot seriously ask middleincome americans to pick up the tab on more time the alleged advantages of the cllntongephardt plan for middleincome americans ring hollow just like the everelusive middleincome americans tax cut promised by the clinton administration and the promise to end welfare as we know it judging from the calls and letters i have received in my office middleincome americans are tired of being washingtons fall guy the white house and the democrat

remarkable erosion of support among middle americans that is to say americans of middleincome for the clinton health care bill and for the clinton health care bill in its legislative form in the other body where it is the clintonmitchell bill and in the house where it is the clintongephardt bill the same phenomenon occurred last year during consideration of the clinton tax bill during the 1992 campaign as a candidate he talked about middleclass tax cut but in fact we know how quickly that evaporated once we got down to brass tacks instead this congress pushed through the biggest tax increase in american history one that directly impacted the middle class for example seniors receiving social security making 14 000 got a 70percent effective rate increase on their social security benefits that is how much their income taxes went up on social security benefits that recordbreaking tax increase passed by the congress will pale in comparison to the clintongephardt bill that we are likely to take on here in the house although it is difficult for us to talk about it as members of congress because while we have looked at the press releases and press statements about the bill we are still waiting we are still waiting for a bill even though we are just days away from adjournment and the congress hopes to act on health care before we adjourn but we do not have a bill the congressional budget office has not been able to give us an estimate of how much precisely in the way of new taxes the bill contains and precisely how much in the way of new spending the bill contains we simply have not read it this is more than a trivial point health care comprises oneseventh of our nations economy it is also on a more personal level a matter of life and death for every american one would think that a new health care plan prescribed by the federal government for the whole country would therefore be the most carefully studied document since the constitution but instead when as and if this congress and house get around to seeing and voting on a bill we are going to find that members have not had a chance to read it that in fact when we vote members will know more about o j simpsons blood type than they will about the content of our own health care legislation but we operate necessarily in an environment of uncertainty we do not have a bill but we must debate what it is we anticipate because after all the vote will be upon us and that will be it and we will have an election we must adjourn at some point and that point is arriving rather quickly why are people skeptical of what they have been seeing the heritage foundation did an analysis of the clintongephardt bill as it was released what they found is that the ew taxes and there are many of them in the clintongephardt bill would amount to 42 6 billion in the first full effective year of the plan in 1999 on top of the current costs on the system people who are saying these new taxes are only going to displace existing health care costs or somehow limit the growth of health care costs must face this fact 42 6 billion in new taxes will be imposed by the clintongephardt health care bill on top of our current estimates for how much the existing system is going to cost now the average additional tax burden per individual as a result of the clintongephardt bill according to the heritage foundation is 430 per individual on average the clintongephardt bill unquestionably is going to offer americans less choice it does not quite do justice to the fact to say less almost none compared to what presently an insured american has available congress and the federal government are going to prescribe a standard health care plan and that is going to be the norm for the country like it or not if your existing plan is different than the standard plan if you continue to get those benefits you will pay a tax not only will you pay a tax but your employer will pay a tax the new taxes imposed by the clintongephardt bill are going to be split 80 percent by the employer and 20 percent by the individual so 20 percent of these new taxes will come directly out of the paycheck of the american worker there will be far more bureaucracy in this plan because for a substantial part it is going to rely upon something called medicare part c medicare part c is in effect a governmentrun insurance plan that will extend together with the existing medicare program to over half the entire population or to about half the entire population according to our best estimates half of the american people at that point will be getting their health care from a government plan as compared to the current system the more americans learn it seems the more likely they are to realize that instead of providing americans with greater health security the clinton gephardt plan clinton mitchell plan over in the other body and whatever congressional cousins are aboard or are just now being written in so many different staff offices will create greater uncertainty especially for middleincome americans middleincome americans will pay more in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both quantity availability of health care and the quality of that care why will they be paying more in premiums we discussed why they pay more in taxes under the clinton gephardt bill why pay more in premiums because of the community rating system that is where factors like age cannot be taken into account senior citizens incur about 4 timeson average in the way of health care costs as younger working americans if you are under 45 years old you will have a steep increase in your health care premiums under a community rating system so for all americans under 45 years old the clinton gephardt plan the clinton gephardt health care plan is going to represent a big increase in premiums on top of the payroll tax increase it is not surprising then that the strategy of the democrat leadership is to in the words of senator rockfeller pass health care regardless of the views of the american people i would hope we would not handle it that way i do hope

transportation committee this provision made a technical correction to section 131 s of the highway beautification act as added by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 that prohibits new billboards on scenic byways the purpose of the istea provision was to protect truly scenic areas all discussion of that provision related to scenic values and the understanding of the members during consideration of that provision was that it related solely to roads in scenic areas the federal highway administration interpreted that provision to override other provisions of the highway beautification act that permit the erection of billboards in commercial and industrial areas under the fhwa interpretation the new istea provision applies to commercial and industrial areas that may be designated as part of a scenic byway for the purposes of connecting scenic areas a state that has a scenic byway program will in most cases want to designate continuous scenic byway routes that is a scenic route that traverses mostly rural areas may pass through towns and cities the advantages of continuous scenic byways are numerous particularly conceming mapping and nolice to motorists what the fhwa interpretation means is that if a state designates a segment of road that runs through a commercial and industrial area as part of a scenic byway for the purpose of connectivity that segment of road would be subject to the new billboard prohibition no matter how urban or blighted that commercial or industrial area might be and even if the state does not want to change its billboard regulation in commercial and industrial areas the public works and transportation committee believes that the fhwa interpretation of section 131 s is not the best reading of the section the last sentence of section 131 s reads as follows control of any sign display or device on such a highway shall be in accordance with this section this section includes subsection d the commercial and industrial exemption the congress intended by this sentence that the scenic byway provisions would be subject to all the other provisions of the highway beautification act in addition if congress had intended to override other longstanding provisions of the act it would have explicitly done so a basic feature of the beautification act is to permit states to allow billboards to remain in industrial and commercial areas congress would not have relied on inference to make such a drastic change in the law indeed the conferees on istea never discussed the possibility of overtuming the commercial and industrial exemption the anomaly of the fhwa interpretation is that it preempts states in an area where they have never been preempted under the highway beautification act under the act a state may ban new billboards anywhere n the state including commercial and industrial zones the state may also choose to continue the federal commercial and industrial exemption the fhwa interpretation tells the state that if it designates a continuous scenic byway it may not as a matter of federal lawcontinue the commercial and industrial exemption even in the most blighted

adjustment act which says that any people coming from cuba who are landed in the united states are automatically on the way to citizenship no questions asked basically unlike our stance toward any other country in the world i also said that under the 1966 act there is nothing that requires the united states having rescued cubans from the sea to necessarily land them in the united states i understand that this afternoon the president will announce that cubans being rescued will no longer be taken to the united states but perhaps at guantanamo bay or some other place that is ok that takes care of one problem the other problem the 1966 act still is on the books so i hope that part of our relook at this situation will take a second look at that act it does hamper our ability to respond to these immigration emergencies"], [0.00012978911399841309, 0.4998702108860016, 0, "i thank the gentleman as i say we are going to oppose the rule when it comes to the floor"],

interest of everyones time i thought i would speak at this time i say to the gentleman from new york i urge adoption of the rule house resolution 420 for consideration of the bill h r 2442 the economic development administration reauthorization act we have worked long and hard on this piece of legislation and i think that people especially in business and people who are looking for goodpaying jobs are going to applaud this legislation this is an open rule i compliment my friend from new york for getting this open rule it does not happen often it is noncontroversial from the minority point of view no legislation is perfect and this bill is not perfect but it is a good bill and i will be stating the reservations i may have when we argue this particular bill and not the rule on the floor the rules provision for considering an amendment in the nature of a substitute provides for immediate consideration of the kanjorski amendment the kanjorski amendment providing for hightech transfer corporation consists of major provisions of h r 3550 legislation of which i am an original cosponsor without the kanjorki amendment bipartisan support for the substitute bill would be greatly weakened this proposal is designed to create new goodpaying hightech private sector jobs without any major new goveinment outlays this initiative is designed to expedite businesses utilization of hundreds of billions of dollars of research and development for work paid by the federal governmentthat is our taxpayersover the past several decades for years and years the taxpayers have paid for research and development but no one has really utilized it this gives us a chance for our companies our workers the people that are working to build up our economy to have this opportunity a clearinghouse of information about federally funded new technologies would be created and that is precisely what we have been hearing in our committee on banking finance and urban affairs and the committee on small business and the committee on foreign affairs where we deal with economic policy and trade people are saying where can we go to in the federal government to find these new discoveries where can we find these discoveries that can help us the new breakthroughs and this is going to help us a government chartered corporation funded by a stock sale a stock sale would operate as a one stop shopping place for businesses we cannot expect our american businesses to come and search all over the country all over washington pay huge fees to various companies so they can find out what is available i think that this clearinghouse is going to be a real blessing a real boon to our businesses andto the people who are looking for goodpaying jobs unless burdened by unacceptable floor amendments the bill will have significant bipartisan support i predict i intend to support this legislation if the house approves it substantially as reported and with the kanjorki amendment to the substitute so i urge my colleagues to vote for this constructive rule and to vote for this job creating initiative and i want to thank the gentleman from new york my friend for giving me this time today and i want to compliment all the committee on rules members for obtaining an open rule i think that is a real feather in their cap and i want to say we all appreciate that work"],

there on the streets and know what is real and know what is just congressional talk so i want to speak in behalf of the bill and speak against the penny amendment this bill will work it is not perfect but this body has never worried about perfection it is better than what we have now one of the key components of it is this concept of spreading the risk getting more farmers to participate one of the things you have to have in order to do that is a distribution system of the private sector insurance agents can sell this product right now they are not doing it because there is no money in crop insurance for the insurance agent and they do not want to do it the only reason an insurance agent would do it is to pick up a guys homeowners insurance or the insurance on his tractor or histruck they do not go out and make a living selling crop insurance that is why there is not much market penetration right now the penny amendment would reduce that even further and thus pull out one of the strong legs of this whole prograin i urge my colleagues to vote for the bill and against the amendment"], [0.0002022385597229004, 0.5002022385597229, 0, "my amendment simply seeks to set the record straight it says it is the sense of this congress that when we require the coast guard to take on additional or extraordinary duties we will also consider how to pay for them the coast guard is the smallest of our armed services yet its responsibilities are great we ask the coast guard to be responsible for the navigation and safety of our waterways for maritime law enforcement for emergency search and rescue for maritime inspection and licensing for defense readiness and much much more on top of these vital functions the coast guard is often called upon to perform extraordinary services services in addition to its many normal duties these extra responsibilities are most often unplanned and unfunded the most recent example of an extraordinary service is operation able manner since january of this year and several times in the recent past a massive coast guard deployment has patrolled the windward passage between haiti and the united states operation able manner has involved an enormous commitment of manpower and equipment the full costs of the operation to date are estimated to be over 88 million millions of dollars are being spent in this effort which were not budgeted for interdiction activities meaning that the money must be taken from elsewhere in tble budget given the coast guards already stretched resources i find the fact that we are forcing it to scale back vital operations in order to meet the extraordinary needs of the haitian crisis very disturbing i am appalled that in general we continue to increase the responsibilities of the coast guard while cutting its operating expenses while my amendment cannot resolve past funding shortfalls it does put the members of this body on record it says that congress will back up its demands on the coast guard with funds necessary to carry them out thank you i urge support for my amendment"]]}
