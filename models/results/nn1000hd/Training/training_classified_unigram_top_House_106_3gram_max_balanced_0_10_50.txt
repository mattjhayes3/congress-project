would hope that could be brought to my attention so i could yield the second half of the hour to him this is my first speech of the 106th congress i would like to welcome back my old colleagues and welcome our new colleagues my new colleagues i have not had a chance to introduce myself to all of them let me take this opportunity to do so i am brad sherman i hail from americas bestnamed city sherman oaks california periodically i seek an opportunity to give a rather long speech detailing a number of different topics this saves the house from having to listen to a number of short speeches each on a separate topic i often give these speeches at the beginning or the end of a session i have a number of topics i would like to address today the first of these is the current unpleasantness occurring in the senate the problems involving monica lewinsky the president et cetera first i would like to point out that it is unprecedented in our lifetimes that an impeachment would be sent by this house over to the other body on a 99 percent partisan vote with 99 percent of the one party voting against the impeachment resolution i think it is a shame a shame on this house that we would send an impeachment resolution to the senate under those circumstances i came to the floor last month actually in december to voice my opinion that in not allowing members to vote on censure and then sending over articles of impeachment on a partisan basis that this house had gone astray i said at that time that i would call this house a kangaroo court but that would be an insult to marsupials everywhere that shame has hung in this chamber until yesterday because i think we owe a debt of gratitude to prosecutor ken starr for doing something so outrageous that it has distracted america from the mistake we made here in december ken starr knows we all know that the president is not going to be removed from office yet a leak emerges from ken starrs office that he thinks that he will criminally indict and perhaps prosecute a sitting president this is not only a constitutional outrage it represents perhaps the worst prosecutorial judgment ever displayed ken starr has in the words of george stephanopolous pursued the president with the hateful tenacity of captain ahab and it is time for this misjudgment to stop it is bizarre that ken starr seeing that the president will not be removed from office has begun to fantasize that he will barge into the oval office and place handcuffs on the president of the united states perhaps during some meeting with a foreign head of state we must take actions to show that this pipsqueak cannot barge into the oval office and cannot seek to undermine the executive branch of government i recognize and we all recognize that president clinton remains subject to the rule of law while he is president he can be impeached and has been by this house and could be removed by the senate as soon as he leaves the white house he is subject to all manner of criminal action and of course is subject to civil action as well we need to look longterm at what this means for the presidency i ask those on the republican side of the aisle to remember that some day it may be one of theirs who is sitting as president imagine some future president and imagine his enemies or should i say her enemies begin immediately upon inauguration day to conspire and they gather a few million dollars to carry it out i used the word conspire conspiracy is not the right word they simply gather together to begin a plan to undermine some new president they gather a few million dollars together and the first thing they do is announce that they will pay a 1 million book advance to any secret service agent willing to write a book titled embarrassing things i learned while guarding the president imagine that they place an ad in the star tabloid or should i call it the ken starr tabloid the ad goes something like this have you been abducted by a ufo was the president working with the aliens if so contact us we will give you 1 million and we will help you sue the president for everything that went on on the spaceship and by the way if that ufo abduction happened if the spacecraft happened to land in any one of these three or four counties where we have in some obscure county somewhere in america a friendly prosecutor then we will also be able to urge that obscure prosecutor to bring criminal action against the president i am not sure that a lawsuit or criminal prosecution for participation in an ufo abduction against a president of the united states would last all that long it might be thrown out of court but i give this as an illustration of the road we are going down that road is that the enemies of every president those who are most blinded by their hatred of that president will begin to try to destroy a president by finding out secrets and embarrassing tidbits from the secret service by convincing people to begin civil suits that will distract the president and embarrass him or her and by trying to convince local prosecutors around the country even in the most obscure counties to bring criminal actions against the president for these reasons i think it is important that this house adopt and i look forward to beginning to draft a presidential protection act the basic tenets of this act would be three in number the first is that those who work for the secret service would be required to keep what they learn confidential even if they want to write a book they should not be allowed to do so based on secrets they learned on the job second of course they should enjoy a privilege from being compelled to testify about those secrets there might be a few exceptions but imagine a situation where a secret service agent could testify about how long this meeting took place or how many times the president contacted this or that adviser imagine the chilling effect it would have if a president felt he could not reach out or she could not reach out to advisers around the country because the names of those advisers or even the nature of what they discuss could be a matter of public discovery second a presidential protection act or rather a presidency protection act should provide that as to all criminal actions or attempts at criminal prosecution that we toll the statute of limitations so if there is a 5year statute of limitations on a particular crime that any day that occurs while an individual is serving in the white house as president would not count toward that 5year period then we provide that there will be no criminal indictments or trials of anyone while they are president of the united states we could provide that under certain circumstances testimony could be taken in case some witness might die or become unavailable in the years that someone served in the white house but clearly no president of the united states should have to worry for a minute about the criminal law systern being visited upon him or her by a politicallymotivated prosecutor finally we need to have a very similar proceedings dealing with civil suits that the statute of limitations is tolled that is to say in nonlegal jargon the suit is put in the freezer and it can be tried after a presidency is completed i know that the supreme court ruled in the jones vs clinton case that you could sue a sitting president the supreme court noted that the congress could change that result the supreme court argued that a civil suit against the president would not be an undue distraction clearly later events have proven otherwise i am frankly surprised given the number and the power of certain individuals who hate this president that there have not been a dozen or a hundred other civil lawsuits trumpedup real or imagined for this or that reason brought against the president i make these comments not to invite such highly destructive behavior but rather to illustrate why the house and the senate must act to make it clear that any civil lawsuit against the president is put in the freezer that the statute is tolled until the presidency is over as i pointed out such a statute would be just as protective of a republican president as a democratic president and given the heightened level of partisanship that has occurred as a result of those who are scheming to try to destroy president clinton given the fact that that higher level of partisanship unfortunately is beginning to afflict both parties i think it is critical that we act now to make sure that small groups of wellfinanced individuals cannot destroy a presidency i will be circulating a letter to my colleagues urging that they sign onto a bill but even before that urging that they give me their comments or meet with me in the drafting of a bill so that i can have bipartisan input into how it is drafted i am considering and would like my colleagues to comment on whether on an emergency basis we need to adopt a bill just dealing with criminal prosecutions and making it very clear to ken starr that he is not empowered and no prosecutor is empowered to go barging into the oval office with a pair of handcuffs the very possibility the very argument that that could legally occur undermines our system of government and makes us a laughingstock around the world i would now like to shift to international relations as many of my colleagues know i served on the committee on international relations i do want to comment about our friendship with greece and the republic of cyprus we all know that the very essence of democracy and so many of the values that are at the core of americanism developed in greece greece and cyprus want nothing more at this point than to defend themselves from the possibility of air attack and have sought air defense missiles i regret very much that the administration pressured the government of cyprus not to deploy air defense missiles that had been acquired i agree with the administration cyprus should not have acquired missiles from russia cyprus should have acquired missiles built in the 24th congressional district in california when the united states is willing to sell greece and cyprus the air defense mechanisms that it needs there will be no need for greece and cyprus to try to buy these from other places and potentially have russian technicians on greek or cyprian soil these are defensive weapons they add to the stability of the aegean we ought to change our policy and make it very clear to cyprus and greece that we are willing to sell defensive weapons to those two countries on the one proviso that the manufacturers be located in the 24th congressional district i had the honor to accompany the president of the united states on his trip to the middle east in december i want to applaud the president for making that visit i also want to point out that the president was warmly welcomed by all the various legislators and officials of the palestinian authority and the palestinian national council but after the president left yasser arafat made statements in support of iraq and calling for an arab meeting to condemn american policy with regard to iraq just a few days after the president departed and we all departed he was once again talking about a unilateral declaration of statehood there is nothing worse for the peace process than a unilateral declaration of statehood by the palestinian authority here this year in congress we need to make it clear that immediately without further action upon any declaration of statehood made on a unilateral basis by the palestinian authority all american aid to that authority stops and all american representatives at all international organizations especially the world bank and similar organizations must vote against any aid to the palestinian authority after such a destabilizing effort i want to applaud the administration for remaining involved and dedicated to peace in the middle east but point out that pressuring israel is not the way to achieve that peace israel has been pro america whether we had a republican administration or a democratic administration a republican house or a democratic house we should remain dedicated allies of israel whether the government in jerusalem is likud or labour the new party being organized and headed by isaac mordecai and others in looking at the situation in the middle east we need to focus on both the shortterm and longterm needs for security all too much of the focus has quite naturally been on the shortterm needs as if land for peace meant a peace consisting nothing more than a month without a terrorist incident or a year without a bomb any such shallow definition of peace will not generate the kind of treaty that is eventually necessary for a final agreement with the palestinians can we ask the israelis to make the kinds of concessions even in part that the palestinians are asking for if peace means only peace with the palestinians instead as part of any peace agreement yasser arafat personally and the entire palestinian authority must be willing to become apostles for peace must be willing to go to every arab capital every islamic capital and urge the recognition of israel trade relations with israel and most important of all a general recognition that israel is a permanent inherent part of the middle east there are those in the arab world who describe israel as just the second of the crusader states nonislamic states created in the holy land that lasted less than two centuries that cannot continue we cannot have arab children educated for war or taught that israel is eventually to be driven in the ocean for that reason we need to change arab education just as much as we need to make any changes in any of the borders between zone a zone b and zone c of the west bank a b and c being different levels of palestinian authority and israeli military control land for peace must involve sowing the seeds of peace knowing that it will take a generation or two or three for them to bear fruit but sowing the seeds of peace in an organized and systemic matter throughout the middle east this is critical to israels longterm security because any student of history will tell us and any student of current military affairs will tell us that if israel ever faces the possibility of losing another war or some war in the future it will not be to an army based in ramallah if israel must fear for its security in the sense of potentially losing a war it must fear armies based in baghdad teheran cairo or damascus not only is this a reflection of current military realities or potential future military realities and when i say current military realities clearly israel will not lose a war in the next decade or two no combination of its enemies or potential enemies could beat it but we must look not one or two decades but one or two centuries in the future and recognize that at various times in the past egypt syria babylon now iraq and persia now iran have all conquered the holy land we must create a situation where it is as unthinkable in cairo to erase israel from the map as it would be unthinkable in paris to think of erasing the netherlands or belgium from the map i should also focus on the importance in the peace process to improving the palestinian economy a recent report by the israeli government shows israels dedication on this subject but the fact remains that there are close to 200 000 guest workers in israel workers occupying jobs that could be held by palestinians without displacing a single israeli these guest workers hail from such countries as the philippines and thailand of course we in this body are interested in the future success of the thai economy and the philippine economy yet when it comes to policy in the middle east isriels contribution to the economic recovery of thailand is not as important for the middle east as is economic development of the palestinian authority and of palestinians in general i had a chance to talk to palestinian legislators i feared that as a matter of being politically correct or proud that they would reject or poohpooh or minimize the concept of palestinians working almost exclusively in nonprestigious jobs in the israeli economy what i found among palestinian leaders to the very highest levels was practicality and an understanding of how important it is that especially young palestinian men have a future for themselves and their families and not bitterness and the time on their hands to plot to join hamas and other terrorist groups with that in mind i would suggest that as part of an overall peace process and only in return for palestinian concessions that israel endeavor to provide to the palestinians rather than to guest workers those jobs within its economy for which israelis will not be hired this could be done through a flat prohibition on guest workers other than those arriving from the palestinian authority or some sort of tax on employers who employ guest workers from outside the palestinian areas but whatever steps are taken the need for palestinian jobs is as important as it may seem as just a practical aspect not on the same level as issues of war and peace yet it is i believe critical toward forming the kind of peaceful relationship that will last into the future a second part of this came up when i visited the industrial estate at gaza this is the proudest economic achievement of the palestinian authority and is a site where american aid has been successful in creating a desalinization plant to provide industrial quality water and some drinking quality water for industry at a site which if everything works out well should employ 20 000 palestinians there is however one thing that keeps this site from being as effective as it could be attracting the kind of investment that it would want and of course i hope this site goes further but there should be a second avenue toward palestinian employment in the industrial sectors and that would be an industrial site on the israeli side of the border designed to provide investors with israeli levels of security israeli government israeli levels of assurance that there will never be an expropriation israeli levels of assurance that the currency will always be convertible all of the reasons that investors prefer to invest in developed countries and at the same time be accessible by palestinian workers who would come to work there without necessarily having access to the rest of israel imagine the opportunity to invest in an area where you have a developed countrys government and of course corruption exists in all governments but much less in developed countries than in most developing countries israeli level security israeli level absence of corruption and the risk of corruption or the belief that there might be corruption even if the palestinian authority is able to create a corruptionfree government it will always suffer from the general belief of investors that a third world country is more difficult to do business in than a developed country imagine all of the benefits of investing in a developed country and at the same time having access to the american markets through the unitedstates israel free trade agreement and at the same time having access to israeli technology and engineers and business acumen and at the same time having access to low cost industrial labor provided by the palestinians i should point out that we will see future developments that the palestinians may be eager to have industrial jobs today with israel providing some of the more technological expertise i am confident that if we are able to achieve peace in the middle east the palestinians will develop their own industrial and engineering expertise it is written nowhere in any sacred text that the palestinians will always live in a third world country or third world economy we now want to shift our attention to our relationships with china in focusing on china we see three abominations the first is chinese policy toward proliferation wherever we see the risk of proliferation whether it be in iran or pakistan or north korea there is evidence that china has provided either nuclear weapons or the technology to build them or missiles or the technology to build missiles certainly china cannot enjoy the friendly relations with the united states which it seeks if it is going to be the source of such dangerous proliferation the second abomination is chinas work on human rights where human rights activists were arrested so very recently in another step backward for china finally but i think most importantly is chinas adverse impact on human rights in the united states through its decision to avoid importing from america china sends us 66 billion of exports one cannot go into any store and not find goods made in china yet china accepts only 11 billion of american exports 66 billion to 11 billion is arguably the most lopsided trading relationship in the history of mankind and womankind 66to11 sometimes that means unitedstates workers lose their jobs because chinese imports come in and take those jobs away sometimes though the goods being imported from china could not be profitably manufactured here in the united states but i would argue that if we bought our tennis shoes from india if we bought our garments from bangladesh that if 100 toy companies could be formed in the caribbean that these caribbean countries that bangladesh that india would be recycling those dollars into the united states that they would be buying billions of dollars of our goods if we would be buying additional billions of dollars of their goods not even necessarily on a barter or quid pro quo basis but any economic development in a free country means that the citizens and businesses are free to buy american the trade deficit we have with china is not the product of free economic decisions it is not necessarily the product of any law that the chinese government has published it is a result of oral instructions unprovable to major chinese enterprises to buy american last those who would say the solution is to admit china into the world trade organization must ask themselves what chinese enterprise would buy american goods if a local communist party commissar said orally in a telephone conversation we know we have changed the law we know that it is legal to buy these american goods without tariffs we had to change the law but mr chinese businessman the commissar could easily say if you decide to buy american goods you will be sent to the reeducation camp what could we do bring a charge before the wto this would be a situation and it happens now and would happen in the future until the chinese government agrees that a country that they sell 66 billion of goods to must be a country they are willing to buy 66 billion of goods from the problem we have in this house is what lever do we use to try to force a strong bargalning position i would point out that we are in an amazingly strong bargaining position if we could just go without tennis shoes for a month if we could just satisfy our need for toys elsewhere for a month the chinese economy would be brought to its knees and we would have the kind of negotiations that we need instead we cannot even threaten china with the possibility that we would play fairly and expose them to anything like the trade barriers that our products are subject to the administration unfortunately will not bargain hard and the only device available to us here is to deny most favored nation status to china and that is too draconian a penalty what we need to do is make it clear that if we deny most favored nation status to china that at least the first year or two or three of that denial that we will not adopt all and to the full extent the taxes and tariffs on chinese goods that such an action would call for clearly we do not need to treat chinese goods the way we treat goods from cuba or north korea or libya or other countries that do not enjoy most favored nation status we will never have the votes on this floor to impose that level of tariff on chinese goods so what we must do and i had an opportunity to talk to our colleague the gentleman from new jersey about this and it will be an unusual combination if i and the gentleman from new jersey ever do anything together is provide by statute and even if it is vetoed its meaning would be clear that if and when we deny most favored nation status to china that we would expose its goods to only 20 percent of the tariffs otherwise applicable by that decision so for example if china can import into the united states a pair of tennis shoes with only a one dollar tariff given the fact that china enjoys mfn status and in the absence of mfn status the tax would be 11 which would cripple chinas ability to send those tennis shoes to the united states that we would provide that in the first year of mfn denial the tariff would be only the tariff applicable to mfn countries plus ten percent of the additional tariff imposed on nonmfn countries in this example we would add one dollar of tariff to the dollar we place now on chinese tennis shoes and then a year later we would add another dollar and after that perhaps another dollar so that the immediate effect on unitedstates chinese trade is substantial but not so enormous that members of this congress are unwilling to vote for it i look forward to working with as many of my colleagues as are interested to craft some mechanism to deprive china of some of the benefits that it enjoys under mfn the gentleman from new jersey had an interesting bill to at least deny mfn to those products made in enterprises owned by the peoples libervation army and while that is i think a good thing for us to do i would point out that we cannot count on china to properly identify for us which enterprises are so owned and which enterprise manufactured which goods i would now turn our attention to the budget and comment on the current debate as to who deserves credit for our booming economy today is it the federal reserve board and its chairman alan greenspan or the political system chiefly president clinton i would argue that it is the latter mr greenspan has done an outstanding job and shown tremendous capacity but what he has done is pretty much the same as his predecessors would have done the same as most i would say all mainstream economists would have called upon him to do there is no particular genius in knowing that interest rates can be low and inflation rates will be kept low if we run a declining federal deficit or better yet a surplus at the federal level for many years those of us concerned with the unitedstates economy for many years mainstream economists have said that it would not take a genius to give us low interest rates and low inflation rates if we had fiscally responsible management of the federal government and then they would go on to say but of course that is politically impossible under president clintons leadership we have done the impossible we have shown that democracy can be fiscally responsible keep in mind the new euro that was adopted in europe in order to join this new currency the rule was that european countries and they all had a very hard time meeting this standard would have to have a national deficit of only 3 percent of their gross national product not a single european country even thought of running a surplus in its national government for any democracy to not cut taxes all the way to running a huge deficit to not increase spending at least until the outer limits of a possible deficit are reached for any democracy to say no to those who want to spend money and no or not very much to those who want to cut taxes requires a level of political genius seen in only one place in the world in recent decades and that is here in washington now i would point out that at the beginning of 1998 our republican colleagues suggested an 800 billion let me stress this an 800 billion tax cut over i believe a 5year period a tax cut of almost a trillion dollars had we adopted that provision we might have been popular for a day or a week or a month but in fact we would have crippled this outstanding economic recovery now i am for tax cuts when we were able to say no to a trillion dollars worth of tax cuts and instead what was before this house was 80 billion less than onetenth of what had been proposed before i voted for it and i hope that we have some genuine tax cuts that we can actually afford keep in mind a decision to vote for 80 billion in tax cuts instead of 800 billion in tax cuts is 720 billion of saying no to our own constituents and that is something we need to have the courage to do i hope in a minute to talk about the nature of the kind of tax cut that we would adopt but i want to point out that there has been agreement that we should save 62 percent of the upcoming surplus for social security reaching agreement on that is not enough we need our colleagues on the republican side of the aisle to agree that we reserve 15 percent of the surplus for medicare because it does our seniors little good to tell themthat social security is safe until the year 2055 and of course we should reach a way to say 2075 but even saying that social security is safe until 2055 rings hollow unless we can make sure that medicare is there too another element of the budget that i think is very important and for which i praise the president is dealing with the land and water conservation fund we have a number of special funds that are part of the federal government we have a transportation fund it is funded with tax dollars paid by motorists when they buy gasoline we assured those taxpayers we would spend the money for road improvements and repair and for many years until last year we cheated them out of that promise by spending less out of the transportation fund and using that to hide the deficit we were running in the general fund we finally are treating the transportation fund as a separate sacrosanct fund we have a social security fund it is funded by employer and employee contributions that are to be used exclusively for social security that fund needs to be sacrosanct and used for those purposes and least known of the three special funds i will mention is the land and water conservation fund it is funded out of federal royalties from offshore oil drilling and takes in roughly 900 million a year for many years we spent only a tiny fraction of the land and water conservation fund on its intended purpose keep in mind when that fund was created in 1965 it was a grand compromise and an outstanding deal it said that if our environment is going to be impaired by offshore oil drilling as it is in various places and should not be but it is then the funds that result from that should be used to preserve our environment in other places and should be set aside to buy land to conserve our heritage well when i first got to congress only 14 percent of the funds being taken in by the land and water conservation fund were used to buy our precious lands to protect them from development and to give something to our children i am very proud of the fact that in 1998 this house spent virtually all of the land and water conservation fund to acquire critically needed lands and now as we look to the first budget of the new millennium we must keep faith with the law that established the land and water conservation fund and we should applaud the president for presenting us with a budget that provides for enormous surpluses that safeguards social security and medicare and at the same time allows us to spend nearly a billion dollars in preserving our land for posterity i especially want to complement the president for including within that 5 million to preserve the santa monica mountains by buying critically necessary tracts within those mountains for my colleagues edification i will point out that one out of every 17 americans not one out of every 17 southern californians not one out of 17 californians oneseventeenth of all americans live within an hours drive of the santa monica mountains national recreation area there is no better investment in not just recreational opportunities but the chance to get out into nature and unwind for oneseventeenth of the country than to preserve the santa monica mountains we need to do that one parcel at a time one fiscal year at a time until the land acquisition plan is fully implemented to do less would be to turn to southern californians and say if you want to unwind fine drive to yellowstone and after a thousand miles of hectic travel you can unwind in americas most premier national february 2 1999 park we need to have national parks close to where people live we have one in the santa monica mountains while i am focusing on local issues i should also point out the most important transportation need of the southern california area and that is dealing with the intersection of the san diego freeway and the ventura freeway the 405 and the 101 i want to applaud our state government for beginning a 10 to 15 million plan to provide some immediate quick fixes and one additional lane in order to deal with the huge snarl of traffic at that interchange but these quick fixes and moderate amounts of expenditures will not be enough to solve the problem i want to thank secretary rodney slater for providing for a halfmilliondollar study of what can be done to deal with this intersection and the transition roads that have to accommodate almost half a million cars every day i would like to use the last 10 minutes of my presentation and i thank the house for giving me this much time to focus on one particular type of tax cut that i hope will have bipartisan support and that is the need to reform our estate tax laws to dramatically reduce the amount of estate planning the length of documents and the literal legal torture that we put our elderly and our nearelderly through as a result of an estate planning process that yields virtually no revenue from the middleclass and upper middleclass individuals who need to go through the process let me describe that process briefly we have an estate tax that reaps i believe 17 billion in revenue for this country it is designedto get revenue from the wealthy as great wealth passes from one generation to another we designed the law so that a married couple could leave 1 2 million to their children with no tax at all that is the tax policy that we have established 1 2 million taxfree but we adopted that tax policy in a bizarre way and when i say by the way 1 2 million that number is going to be ratcheted up over the next decade to a total of 2 million depending upon of course when people die and that estate tax becomes applicable in my presentation here i will use the oldfigures the 600 000 figures and the 1 2 million figures that is to say how is it that current law provides for that 1 2 million exemption it provides a 600 000 exclusion to each of the two spouses so what do they have to do to take advantage of this 1 2 million exemption they have to write a long complicated estate planning document and bypass trust so that when the first spouse dies that first spouse does not just leave all the family assets to the surviving spouse oh no that would trigger an estate tax of major proportion when the second spouse dies instead the first spouse to die must leave 600 000 in a trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse the effect is virtually the same but the legal complexities are enormous first just drawing the instrument is a 1 000 to 3 000 legal fee tax imposed on any couple that believes that when the second of them to dies it is possible that their assets will exceed 600 000 and given the possibility that homes in southern california would go up in value with the same rapidity next decade as they did last decade every middleclass married couple sees that as at least a possibility keep in mind those who fail to go through this excruciating estate planning process and i will describe why i think it is excruciating because i have lived it are told well if the second spouse dies there will be a quarter of a million dollars of extra federal tax that you could have avoided a quartermilliondollar penalty on the family for falling to go through this complicated estate planning process but the estate planning process is not over it seems to be over but it is not overwhen the trust is documented and the couple leaves the lawyers office with a 50page document because there will come a time when the first spouse dies and at that point complicated legal steps need to be taken so that assets are put into the trust and other assets are assigned to the widow or widower and then every year thereafter that trust has got to fill out a separate income tax return assets have to be kept separate imagine trying to explain for the 20th time to a 95yearold widow or widower how some assets they have control over and are in trust which they are only allowed to touch under certain circumstances but get the income under other circumstances and other assets are in a different trust why do we afflict americas elderly especially our widows and widowers with the need to be in these bypass trusts now i am not talking here by the way of the living trusts that are established toavoid probate inmany of our states those are genuinely simple but built within so many of them are these bypass trusts created not to avoid probate but created to deal with very complicated tax laws what we should do instead is provide that when the first spouse dies they can leave all the assets or some portion of them to the surviving spouse and any unused portion of the unified credit the in effect 600 000 exemption goes to the surviving spouse in the simplest plan this would mean when the first spouse died all of the assets could go to the widow or widower when the widow or widower passes on later 1 2 million would be exempt from tax and the rest would be subject to tax this is the same tax effect that most couples will be faced with i just think they should be able to reach it without living with these trusts throughout the widowhood or widowerhood of the surviving spouse now the joint tax committee has informed me that they believe that this kind of change would deprive the federal government of a billion dollars a year in revenue for those who want to see a significant estate tax reduction that is a strong reason to join me in this proposed estate tax change but i would argue that that billiondollar reduction in revenue is almost entirely illusory because the bill as i would propose it would provide tax benefits no greater than any married couple could get simply by visiting a lawyer and paying a 1 500 legal fee the vast majority of couples with assets of over 600 000 will do just that and as a result they will obtain through complication the tax savings that i would like to provide through simplicity i look forward to working with the staff of the joint tax committee to get a more reasonable revenue estimate of this estate tax simplification and i look forward to working with as many of my colleagues who are interested in crafting legislation to try to simplify the life of every middleclass and upper middleclass widow and widower in this country i want to thank the chair for extending so much time i want to thank my colleagues for their patience in allowing me to get so many matters off my chest"], [5.1021575927734375e-05, 0.9999489784240723, 1, "a few minutes ago i became aware that this hour of time to speak before this house was available i

take this opportunity even though i have not had the chance to prepare and my remarks may not be quite as crisp as i would like i would like to address a number of different topics that i have been thinking about particularly over this last district work period the first is an odd attempt by those who claim to love ronald reagan to rewrite the history of the fall of the soviet union we know what the real history was the soviet union looked powerful we spent on our defense fearful of soviet aggression and expansion and ronald reagan led us in those efforts our deficit grew we tightened our belts domestically we did so because we were told that the soviet union could expand that it was powerful that it could emerge as the most powerful nation on earth in 1991 to the surprise of just about everyone both inside and outside the soviet union the soviet union began to collapse that is what really happened it is kind of disconcerting to think that all the experts in all the capitals did not foresee such an enormously important event and experts are reluctant to admit that they cannot always see the future but what is worse is that those who have come to idolize ronald reagan have started to rewrite history in their rewriting of history ronald reagan foresaw as early as the early 1980s that within a decade the soviet union could be pushed into the dust bin of history that reagan knew that the soviet union had begun to corrode from the inside and far from being a challenge to the united states in fact it was a nation that could not survive these supposed supporters of ronald reagan ascribe to him an omniscience and allknowingness that they think is complimentary in fact what these supporters of reagan are doing are besmirching ronald reagans character attacking his honesty and telling us that our former president is a liar to the american people time and again president reagan came before us in this hall i was not here stood and delivered the state of the union address and rallied america to spend more and more on our defense e0 2100 he never told us it was offense he said it was necessary to prevent soviet expansion not some secret plan to force the soviet union into collapse ronald reagan came before the american people and told us the soviet union was a powerful threat and would remain so for quite some time he urged us to embark upon military expenditure projects some of which would last a decade or 2 decades because he told us the soviet union was a threat now those who claim to be ronald reagans ideological descendants some who claim to be his friends tell us it was all a lie that ronald reagan knew that the soviet union had corroded from the inside that he knew that these expenditures were not necessary to defend us but rather were part of a secret plan to force the soviet union to spend more and more on its defense in a dangerous game in which the soviet union would be faced either with the prospect of launching a nuclear strike or consenting to an arms race that it could not win an arms race launched against it by a reagan administration with a secret plan to drive it into destruction ronald reagan never told us that we were engaged in such an effort ronald reagan never told us that we were trying to push the soviet union to destruction that they would face a moment at which they would blame us and would realize that either they would launch a military strike or go into the dustbin of history he never told us this because he never believed it and the soviet union in its dying hours did not believe it either the soviets knew that their system collapsed of its own weight only retroactive american arrogance would say that the other superpower collapsed because of something we did here in washington d c the fact of the matter is communism does not work and in the last decade or two both communist giants have ceased to embrace their ideology and without that ideology they have ceased to be exporters of communism ceased to have confidence in communism and it has shaken them to their roots are we going to say that communism lost favor in the soviet union because of american hostility and communist ideology lost favor in china because of american friendship that either friendship or hostility from america creates the same result i think not communism does not work russia and china realized it this forced a crisis of confidence in both places the soviet union not being one nation but rather an amalgam of nations held together by a failed ideology collapsed and china has moved from the ideology of communism to the ideology of nationalism overseen by a relatively small group of oligarchs and local potentates that control the economy to say that it all happened according to a plan is to dangerously rewrite history while i talk about the reagan administration and the collapse of the soviet union it leads naturally to a discussion of star wars an issue that is still before us just because the soviet union is no longer intact does not mean that we are safe in fact the world is more complicated and more dangerous there are those who have come before this house and suggested that the world does not have to be a dangerous place if only we developed a missile defense system now i would like to see us continue to research in this area and when our technology has advanced to the point where we can provide some reasonable defense at reasonable cost deployment is certainly called for but let us not fool the american people those that cannot hit us with an icbm those who cannot hit us with an intercontinental ballistic missile will be able to smuggle nuclear weapons into our cities no matter how effective our missile shield a nuclear weapon is about the size of a person some smaller than a child and anyone who has been in southern california or probably just about any major city in this country is aware that every year hundreds of thousands every day thousands of illegal immigrants are snuck across our border not just from the southern border but the northern as ell that illegal drugs are smuggled into america with relative ease and this is by people being paid a few hundred dollars to sneak a person into the united states marijuana importers or smugglers criminals bringing in bales of marijuana for a few thousand dollars in compensation how difficult would it be to sneak a nuclear weapon into an american city a nuclear weapon smaller than a child does not need ventilation does not need to be fed children who are smuggled into america scream and cry nuclear weapons would not so imagine that we had a perfect defense against iranian or iraqi or north korean missiles what would those countries do they would smuggle a weapon or two into an american city hire or kidnap an american scientist to come look at it detain that american scientist until it could be moved to another apartment or another city and inform our government that in some apartment in some city in some state in this country there was a nuclear weapon in the custody of someone reporting to baghdad or to tehran i would like to see a defensive shield shielding us from intercontinental ballistic missiles but let us not fool the american people that is just one small element of our defense and if we spend a trillion dollars building a roof over a building that has no walls we will have been misallocating resources i am not sure that we can police our borders well enough to prevent nuclear weapons from being smuggled here but i do know that a missile defense shield is of only modest use as long as our borders remain porous we need to focus our attention on the rogue states that are currently developing nuclear weapons and might be willing to use them even if they faced the threat of annihilation from our nuclear weapons and we need to cut off money investment funds from going to the regimes of north korea iran and iraq because all three of those countries are trying to develop nuclear weapons north korea has agreed to stop its program and i leave them aside we can discuss them separately at a different time but let us focus for a while on the two great enemies or rivals that we face in southwest asia we do need to prevent the government in baghdad and the government in tehran from getting their hands on money when investment capital flows into those two countries when money is loaned to them money is given to them export markets are given to them when iraq is allowed to sell its oil and not spend the money on food for its people then money is in the hands of those who would wish to develop nuclear weapons and whom as i have pointed out will face little difficulty in smuggling them into the united states unfortunately our efforts to stem the flow of money to tehran and baghdad have been set back in several different ways today mr speaker it was revealed that iran having suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties in a war of aggression launched by iraq 2 decades ago now is allowing iraq to use its coastal waters to evade the u n blockade evade u n sanctions sell a billion dollars perhaps every year of oil and this would not be money in the oilforfood program controlled by the united nations this is money directly into the hands of the iraqi military we could spend a trillion dollars on a missile defense system but if we do not stop those oil tankers from leaving the strait of hormuz if we do not prevent that oil from being exported we are literally allowing saddam hussein to build nuclear weapons and then we can worry about how to keep them out of the united states what concerns me is that our policy toward iran has been ineffective the ineffectiveness is shown today by iran allowing that iraqi oil to be exported now we are told that the ships that come from iran down into the persian gulf pass a checkpoint controlled by the revolutionary guard we are told the revolutionary guard does not report to the president of iran and so we should not get bent out of shape if they allow those oil tankers into their coastal waters the fact remains that in iran the president is not the head of their government or military the supreme leader is that leader controls those revolutionary guards and those guards have allowed those tankers to use iranian coastal waters iran has said well we need help in stopping these ships all iran has to do is announce that those countries that are enforcing the u n blockade are allowed into iranian coastal waters allowed within 12 miles of its coast and we will be able to shut down these illegal iraqi oil exports but instead iran lets the tankers go by the checkpoint and claims they cannot do anything to stop it and will not let united nations ships or rather american and british ships detailed to enforce the u n blockade will not allow them in their coastal waters this is a dangerous situation and it shows that our policy toward iran especially in the last 2 months has been mistaken two months ago the secretary of state announced unilaterally without really much consultation with congress at all certainly without any congressional encouragement or approval the secretary of state announced that the united states would allow iran to export to the united states pistachios carpets caviar dried fruit and many people joked how important could that be first it is symbolically important because if america will do business with iran business as usual if america will open its markets to these nonenergy exports of iran then how can we turn to europe and japan and tell them not to do business as usual with iran on a bigger scale how can we today turn to japan and germany and tell them to stop buying iranian oil because iran is clearly complicit in the illegal export of iraqi oil certainly it weakens our position these exports these nonenergy exports from iran are important to iran they are its major nonenergy exports they pale into insignificance in dollar amount compared to oil but reflect on this iran will always get the world price for its oil nothing we do is going to change by one penny the amount of revenue iran gets for every barrel that it exports to a world thirsty for its oil in contrast those other exports the carpets pistachios et cetera those exports need every market they can find to try to push up the price and by opening up our markets we invigorate the world market for those iranian exports exports as to which there is no fixed world price exports that are important to the iranian economy some 5 million people it is reported work in the iranian carpet industry that is just one of the four imports we would think that today the state department would react react to these illegal shipments through iranian waters and cut off irans access to americas markets my fear is that that will not happen every time there is an opportunity to make a unilateral concession to iran we seem to do it and do it quickly unilateral concession after unilateral concession the latest pat on the back that iran has received is a 231 million loan from the world bank the unitedstates voted against that loan but we certainly did not tell our european allies that we would take their votes in favor of that loan as a reason to perhaps reexamine other aspects of our foreign policy we were good losers we accepted the defeat this calls into question how we provide foreign aid i have come to this floor in the past to support american foreign aid i think we should do what we can to help the third world develop to help the poorest people on this planet survive but the recent action by the world bank threatens americas support for foreign aid that support is not all that deep to begin with but how do we go back to our districts and explain that america participates in the world bank its capital was provided in significant part by the american taxpayer and the world bank disbursed 231 million of loans to iran money that is fungible money that allows the iranians to spend their oil resources and oil revenues on their military programs this is going to be a hard sell sometime this month we will be dealing with the foreign ops appropriations bill at that point we will be asked to appropriate hundreds of millions of dollars to the ida program administered by the world bank we have to be aware that money of the united states disbursed to that program could be lent on a concessionary basis could be lent at very low interest rates payuswhenyoufeellikeit terms to such countries as north korea or sudan or any other country that claims to have a good project and is very poor north korea and sudan are very poor because of the evil of their governments not because of a lack of world aid how are we going to go back to our constituents and say these hundreds of millions of dollars were turned over to an international organization free to make loans to some of the most evil nations or evil governments i want to stress evil governments on this planet better we appropriate these same funds and i do not want to see a reduction i want to see if anything an increase in our foreign aid and provide these same funds to entities under the control of the united states government or entities where we at least have a veto power so these funds are loaned or given only for projects in countries that have some minimal respect for human rights i look forward to working with members of the relevant subcommittee and of the committee on appropriations to see what we can do to make sure that when we go back to our districts and defend foreign aid we can say that all unitedstates tax dollars are going for projects in countries that we can support this is an additional reason why the loan to iran was not only a poor decision but one that was illtimed as well not only does iran today a few days after the loan decide to facilitate iraqi evasion of u n sanctions not only does iran sponsor terrorism and is on the state department terrorism list not only is iran along with iraq one of the two greatest threats for possible destruction of american cities at such time as they develop nuclear weapons but iran a year and a half ago decided to continue its oppression of its small jewish community just as it oppresses those of the bahai faith the iranian government since its revolution has executed on trumped up charges 17 members of its small jewish community well over half of that community has fled and now 13 jews are on trial in the city of shiraz on the most trumped up charges in trials that would have made josef stalin ashamed trials where the only evidence is the apparently tortured or coerced confessions of the defendants in which the defendants confessed to crimes they could not possibly have committed here in the united states we live in a multiethnic multicultural society in which people of any ethnic or religious group may be found in our national security agencies and yes may be found among those few who commit espionage we have had britishamerican spies we have had jewishamerican spies we have allegedly had chineseamerican spies anybody of any ethnic group could find themselves in a position where they are the custodians of our national secrets iran is just the opposite no one of the jewish faith is allowed near anything of any military or national security significance whatsoever these 13 are accused of spying for the cia and i put forward that we could not be the worlds only superpower we could not have emerged in this powerful position if our cia went to iran looking for spies and decided to hire people from the small ethnic group that are prohibited from getting anywhere near any of the information our cia might be interested in these charges are absurd the world bank loan to iran as this trial continues was the kind of mistake that imperils american support for foreign aid and american support for the world bank and imperils a relationship that has recently been celebrated by the president in his farewell tour farewell as president tour of europe involving ties that are certainly disrupted when european nations say we will ignore the trial of the 13 jews in shiraz we will ignore irans other problems and when they will force the world bank to take american capital and money borrowed on the strength of american capital and hijack that xnoney to tehran i would now like to shift my focus to a bill that will come before this house i believe on friday and that is a bill to repeal the estate tax at the outset let me stress that 98 percent of all americans when their wills become operative do not pay a penny of estate tax this is a tax paid by only 1 percent of all the families in america yet to read some of the lebters to listen to some of the rhetoric on this floor we would think that the estate tax was the most burdensome tax on american working families estates of under 2 million will after the current law becomes hopefully effective pay absolutely nothing as long as some law and estate planning documents are drafted in advance i introduced a bill that made this law i think less burdensome on upper middle class american families and said that 2 million could be left by a man and wife or a husband and wife to their children with no estate tax even if they did not prepare a bunch of estate planning documents in advance this bill was designed to liberate widows and widowers from these bypassed trusts complicated legal documents almost required of them by our current estate tax law but that bill did not get a hearing because there is an effort here not to liberate upper middle class families and of course those of lesser means are already exempt but not to liberate upper middle class families from the estate tax and from the burdens of doing estate planning the plan here is to abolish this estate tax altogether the estate tax is a painful tax it is a bad tax i hate the tax i hate all taxes every single one of them is painful there is no way for the federal government to get money that does not have a bad effect on those who are required to pay the question is not whether the estate tax is a bad tax but whether it is our worst tax i ask members is a tax that 98 percent of all americans are exempt from is that our worst tax or is it an income tax and a fica tax that falls so heavily on the working poor must we first eliminate a tax that falls chiefly on those with estates over 10 million or must we first eliminate taxes on those who are making 10 an hour or less should it be 10 million and more or 10 an hour or less where should we focus our generosity where should we focus our tax cuts there is an earned income tax credit but it is not available to many of the working poor and is not available to any that do not have children in their homes so we have a situation where we are told that the estate tax diminishes the incentive to work because somebody working at age 40 or age 50 or age 60 is thinking ahead to the point when their estate plan would become effective in their eighties or nineties thinking ahead to what the estate tax law might be at that point knocking off work early and going to the golf course maybe it is happening maybe it is not but let us talk also about the effect that our current taxes have on the working poor people who are called upon to work the second job to support a family people who are called upon to get off of welfare and to enter the work force and we tell them we are going to take a chunk of your money of your paycheck to support the social security system and i support the social security system we are going to impose an income tax we are not going to give you a tax credit for the social security tax you pay and we will give you no tax credit for the state sales tax that you pay people who make less than 10 an hour are paying a lot of tax what about them are they affected by incentives are we to say that the ability to leave the second 10 million to your kids 20 or 30 years from now is what is uppermost on the minds of somebody building a business but that the size of todays paycheck is irrelevant to a person who is working two jobs i do not think so yes all taxes have an adverse impact on incentive the incentive to work the incentive to participate in the economy but i venture that there is a far worse effect on our economy from taxing those who make less than 10 an hour than taxing those who have more than 10 million i would also point out that before we cut the estate tax before we eliminate the estate tax we ought to make sure that we are not endangering social security that we are not putting ourselves in a position when we will not be able to provide any pharmaceuticals to those who are on medicare some who need 1 000 5 000 10 000 a year of pharmaceuticals to survive they retired believing they had social security and now find that they are insecure find that they do not have the wherewithal to pay for the pharmaceuticals that they need to survive what will come before this house on friday is a bill to repeal the estate tax before we have made social security secure before we have made medicare recipients secure every medicare recipient today knows that tomorrow they could be diagnosed with a disease requiring 5 000 or 10 000 a year of pharmaceuticals for which they will get no federal aid and we are told that the most important thing we can do with the available federal funds is to deal with a tax that falls most significantly on those with more than 10 million i suggest that we need to explore a number of avenues now i do not want to ignore the adverse effects of the estate tax it does make it more difficult to leave a business or a family farm to the next generation and we hear statistics about how businesses are not always left intact to the next generation and we are told that it is the estate tax it is not always the estate tax the son or daughter of a farmer does not necessarily want to farm the owner who builds a business from nothing to a 50 million business may find that his sons and daughters feel themselves unqualified or just disinterested in continuing to own that business there is no proof that family businesses will stay in families if only we reduce taxes on those with assets of over 10 million finally one little secret about the estate tax no one will tell it to us that is that at every major hospital complex nonprofit hospital at every major university in this country if we abolish the estate tax the buildings will not have names i am not saying that we will not be able to find our way around campus that is not the problem the problem is that gifts major gifts to our universities and hospitals will slow to a trickle if we go to any campus today we see this building is named after the smith family and that building is named after the cohen family and we wonder why the answer is simple the families involved made huge gifts to the university huge gifts to the hospital motivated in part by the fact that those gifts will not be subject to the estate tax charitable giving at the low end the 5 and 10 put in the collection plate would not be affected by a repeal of the estate tax but at the high end when people are bequeathing millions of dollars to universities that in their graciousness choose to name buildings after the donors at the high end where people make gifts that are income tax deductible in their 80s knowing that not only do they get an income tax deduction today but perhaps if they die in their 90s they get estate tax relief as well those gifts are motivated by the fact that 60 or 70 percent of the gifts value is represented by a tax deduction that 5 million smith building cost the smith family only 30 percent of 5 million what is going to happen when we repeal the estate tax the universities and hospitals will be here saying now congress you have to appropriate some special money for us but how will we do that we will cut our own revenues by 17 billion a year the colleges the universities the hospitals will not come here and tell us about this because essentially they do not want to bite the hand that feeds them speaking of the hand that feeds them i have had a lot of town halls in my district i have heard hundreds of questions hundreds of complaints i am out in the community almost every day that i am in california at these public gatherings i cannot remember a single occasion when someone has come up and said let us abolish the estate tax i hate to admit it but it is a sin of which virtually everyone in this house suffers or is guilty i also spend time raising money for my campaign and for the campaigns of my colleagues not a day goes by or not even a couple hours go by if a couple of hours are spent talking to those who might make major contributions the estate tax comes up every time not with every person but certainly in every hour or two the reason for that is that this tax does fall upon those who can most afford to come to fundraisers i think that we in this house need to pass campaign finance reform for a lot of reasons but one of them is that we spend too much time at fundraisers and we hear too often too repeatedly from that 12 percent of americans who pay the estate tax who happen to be the same 12 percent of americans who donate the most money for political campaigns if we do not stop and think about it if we do not filter it out we are going to come to the conclusion if one serves in this house that the whole country is concerned about the estate tax because in the average month we hear about it five 10 20 times we have to remember that every one of those times was not out at the community little league was not at a visitation to a senior center was not at a widely publicized town hall but in nine out of 10 cases or maybe 10 out of 10 cases it was through a friend that is a supporter of either us or our colleagues here yes if we serve in this house we need to keep in touch with people and sometimes that is thrown askew when the fundraising burdens and the time commitments of that are imposed upon us i would like to comment just briefly on governor bushs social security plan and some of the rhetoric surrounding that plan governor bush has turned to young people and said that they onlyget a 1 or 2 percent return for the money they put in social security what he has not said is that the first two generations to participate in social security did incredibly well social security brought us out of the depression as much as any program and the first two generations to participate in that program contributed for only a portion of their working lives and received the benefits benefits that many are still receiving today in their 80s and 90s so what does this mean it means that todays social security tax is paying for our grandparents retirement this was never a pension system where our money is saved exclusively for us rather our money is being used to fund the retirement of those who went before just as their money went to fund the retirement of those who went before and we can trace it back to the depression generation now we are told that the new generation does not have to contribute to pay for the previous generations retirement we are going to have their money diverted into separate individual accounts and that anything else would be unfair we cannot simultaneously take all the funds that are coming into social security and say that is the money of the people who put the money in and continue to fund the so6ial security payments to those who are receiving checks today people whose tax dollars fica contributions were used to pay the prior generations benefits the proposal that the governor has put forward is to take onesixth of the money virtually that is now going into the regular social security trust fund and divert it into special assets owned by those who contribute the funds i wish we could promise that i wish we could do that but before we start bestowing multitrillion dollar benefits new benefits why do we not make sure that the program can continue to pay the existing benefits another huge benefit promised by the governor of texas is that if one were to die before reaching 65 their family gets a huge check from social security or if they were to die at age 68 or 69 or 70 before they have received their actuarial expected benefit the family receives a giant benefit that is a wonderful promise i wish i could make that promise i would be a lot more popular if i made that promise but what do we do to those who live to 90 or 100 do we say that those who live less than their average life span get their money back and those that live longer than the average life span stop receiving benefits there is no solution offered by the governor of texas two huge benefits promised nosource of revenue to pay for them a sixth roughly of the money diverted let us make social security secure and then we can focus on whether we can do better i have talked about a number of topics topics that are complex topics that i do not get enough time to study about read about and it leaves me longing for a greater level of intelligence there are those working on greater levels of intelligence today there are those engaged in silicon chip engineering who are creating more intelligent machines all the time and there will come a time when the silicon chipdriven machines rival humans in intelligence there are genetic engineers mapping the human genome and within a few decades they may be in a position to create a more intelligent human being perhaps one that could have dealt with all of the topics confronting this congress with greater wisdom than i have been able to muster there are those dealing with nanotechnology technology where things are manipulated at the atomic and molecular levels technologies that offer a chance to engineer either from biological materials or from electronic materials or from a combination of the two a level of intelligence way beyond todays computers way beyond todays animals and perhaps way beyond todays humans speaking of intelligent humans on august 7 1939 albert einstein wrote to president roosevelt and brought to his attention clearly and crisply the importance that nuclear technology might have for the future of the world in just a few years that nuclear technology literally exploded what was the high and unusual science of 1939 became the public policy issue of 1945 and beyond we today are still wrestling with the political the international and the ethical issues of nuclear power and of course nuclear weapons would it not have been great if we had gotten a bit more of a head start would it not have been good for humankind if the scientists had come to us 20 or 30 years before the nuclear weapons were created and told the worlds political leaders that the genie will soon be leaving the bottle and it is time to develop a code of ethics and central understandings that will fit the new technology now some more than 50 years after nuclear weapons we are still struggling with the ethical issues that they create well i do not know how many years we have before what i refer to as remembered intelligence poses even more severe ethical issues for us than nuclear weapons do let me bring a few of them to our attention i know this may sound like science fiction today but i do not think anyone familiar with science would say that these are not real possibilities i am not saying this decade maybe not next decade maybe not in the lifetime of those of us who have lost our hair but certainly within the lifetime of some of the younger folks in the back of the room first we will see genetic engineering that will either create or offer to create our slaves or our masters today dogs are a mans and womans best friend they are great pets and a few of them are engaged in work shepherding sheep for example todays dogs have been bred not genetically engineered just bred to be friendly docile and obedient there are a few who think it raises ethical issues but most of us view a dogs intelligence as below that of selfawareness and consciousness and are quite happy to have dogs that are obedient docile but what happens when the genetic engineers start developing more intelligent canines what happens when we start having dogs as intelligent or more intelligence than apes fortunately i do not think we are going to face this issue in the next decade but we are going to face it this century and we are probably going to face it before we figure out what to do with it at what point must we recognize other life forms as being protected by our constitution how intelligent must a genetically engineered animal be to be worthy of our protection and respect i do not know likewise we have seen many science fiction shows where scientists start with human dna and deliberately try to create a being that is less intelligent or simply more docile than the average human form and we are told to imagine a race invented for slavery i think all of us recoil at the ethics of that but will we recoil with the same level of revulsion if the nearly as intelligent as human or perhaps as intelligent as human docile race is engineered from canine dna or simian dna perhaps someday if we are not careful human dna but not only may there be genetic engineering that invents those entities which some would wish to enslave genetic engineering whether it starts with simian dna or human dna could very well invent a level of intelligence well beyond that of any of us here perhaps even beyond that of the albert einstein i quoted earlier then how should human kind react that which can be done with genetic engineering may also be done with silicon chip engineering a book i have not had a chance to read bears the interesting title the age of spiritual machines how many decades is it before the computer screen lights up with the question am i alive why am i here should there be any ethical limitations on creating computers with intelligence not just to balance our checkbooks or to figure the trajectory of the rocket but computers intelligent enough to ask the spiritual questions i do not know i do know that it will take a panel of einsteins to give us some guidance as to what our laws should be this is going to be a tough issue i am going to propose probably next congress if i am fortunate enough to be here if there is interest by some of my colleagues perhaps we could work on it this month or next month that we create a national commission on the ethics of engineered intelligence to try to give some guidance to those lawmakers that will come after us in dealing with the issues of silicon or carbonbased intelligence that approach or exceed that of todays human being i do not know how to deal with these issues it is a tradition in this town that when one does not know what to do one creates a commission there is also a tradition in this town to wait till the last minute to wait till some development is going to impair jobs in our own districts before we get serious about the issue i would say that these are issues and there are others as well that we ought to try to tackle at least at the thinking stage at the earliest possible time"], [0.0001138448715209961, 0.999886155128479, 1, "it has been my habit to come to the floor occasionally in order to report to this body concerning your nations capital there is a special responsibility that the house and the senate have for the nations capital and it is not possible to get a real sense of what is happening in this city even when in it to see it in perspective without the kind of information that i try to give periodically to this body as we go off to hershey pennsylvania for our second bipartisan retreat therefore i want to discuss this evening an issue and a place about which i am sure there is agreement that bipartisanship should always be the order of the day it is after all the seat of our government the home of more than a half million people the place where all of us want to do all we can to make it the proudest seat of government we can what i would ask of this body what i think the district has a right to ask of this body what i think the people of the district of columbia the mayor and the city council have a right to ask of this body is that it look at the district with fresh eyes for there is a new city if ever there was one before your eyes it is a city where there is a new mayor it is a city where there is a new city council and where there is a new control board i am most appreciative that as the 106th congress convened the speaker the gentleman from illinois received the new mayor anthony williams and me and we had a very good and encouraging discussion the same was true of the chairman of the committee on appropriations the gentleman from florida chairman young and the gentleman from oklahoma the gentleman from oklahoma has gone into the district over the last few weeks to see for himself the city that now comes under his appropriations subcommittee jurisdiction i have gone as well and the mayor to visit the chair of the senate district appropriations subcommittee and the mayor has met with the chairman of the oversight committee for the district mayor george voinovich himself a former mayor the mayor of cleveland may i say that i continue to work and in the bipartisan manner that he and i have long ago established with the chairman of the subcommittee on the district of columbia the gentleman from virginia and that has been a most fruitful partnership and we think it is a model for what we should be trying to achieve in the way of bipartisan cooperation when we meet beginning tomorrow in hershey i should indicate to members that the gentleman from virginia has agreed to sponsor with me a reception for mayor anthony williams here in the house on april 13 in room 2226 rayburn we are doing that simply because we think members would want to meet the new mayor of the district of columbia about which i am sure we have read a great deal and heard a great deal it is seldom that a city experiences the kind of change your capital has experienced over the last few months the city has had a control board because like cleveland and new york and philadelphia it had financial problems although i must say that the financial problems that the district had were almost inevitable because it was carrying state functions and no city in the united states carries state functions may i say how appreciative i am the elected officials are and the residents are that in its wisdom congress removed at least some of those state functions the most costly ones the ones that no city could carry medicaid or at least part of medicaid courts removed pension liability that was built up when the congress was in charge of the district enabling the district to breathe and to get control of its finances we are most grateful for the understanding that that was a necessary obligation of the federal government what we have got in place essentially is an entirely new team the control board is new except for one member the vice chair constance neumann who served so well on the last control board all the other members are new appointed by the president there is as i have said a new mayor and there is a revitalized city council even the new mayor brings something very different from what mayors usually bring to the office this mayor served as chief financial officer and thus is himself partly responsible for the rise of the district once again to economic strength he in effect served an apprenticeship for becoming mayor doing what it is that mayors most have to do and that is balancing a budget and getting control of your finances the city council has some of the same members they are members who have proven themselves to want to exercise oversight and they are joined by others who were elected precisely because the city now demands oversight and accountability a check on the executive from its city council so i ask this body to regard this as morning for the district it is morning again it is like it is outdoors today it is spring it is a new season with a whole new set of actors in place all i ask of this body is it leave behind any sense of the district as it was and give these new players a chance to show what they can do i believe that they not only will do so i think if one reads your morning papers in the district each day one will see that they are doing so i invite everyone to flip through the metropolitan section every once in awhile to see that i am i believe right on this the district is clearly realigning itself first for its own residents and then of course because it wants the congress to understand that it is a new city what i am asking of the congress is that the congress realign itself so that it is ready to meet a new city i want to say a word about what i mean by a new city because i am not this evening speaking rhetorically the city not only has a new administration it has a new administration because it has a new political culture the reason it has a new mayor a new city council is because there was a voter driven reaction to the state in which the city found itself it was not driven by congress it was not driven by any outside force it was drivenby the circumstances that district residents found for themselves essentially it was driven by a loud and virtually unanimous cry of enough from residents that is why i say there is a change in the political culture the kind of change that i think is permanent precisely because it has been driven from the bottom precisely because of its reaction to what voters and residents felt on a daily basis about their city and they wanted it to be better they wanted it to be better not because this body insisted so but because they had to live with it every day and because these people who were in charge were people they could either keep in charge or take from their posts and they have selected among them and i believe selected wisely i am very pleased that all of the signals from congress have been that this body senate and house does understand that this is a new city and should be treated accordingly i am very pleased with the bipartisan approach to the citys issues that we have seen thus far and there is evidence that i will allude to shortly i come to report today in a different spirit than i have come to the floor sometimes on the district i do not come in complaint i do not come to say let the district be the district let democracy reign in the nations capital the way it does every place else i come to say that i am grateful for the way in which congress is stepping back and letting the district do what i believe it is doing very well already i certainly hope and i must say based on our conversations with the leadership i do believe that i will not experience an appropriation this year that is anything like the appropriation i experienced last year where i stood for 10 hours on this floor even though there was before this body a consensus budget and almost no changes were made in the budget itself i stood on this floor for 10 hours while members pasted one or another antidemocratic attachment on the d c appropriation an appropriation that comes here with only money raised from the taxpayers of the district of columbia and by right should not be here at all i had to stand here and fight back for the most part unsuccessfully amendments that members might have wished to put on to their own district but certainly had no right to put undemocratically on to mine this occurred even though everybody could see that the district was on the mend the former mayor had said he was not going to run again the budget was in order and yet the budget became a vehicle for members desires having nothing to do with the wishes of the residents of the district of columbia i am hoping that the new cast of characters if nothing else will get the respect of this body so that our budget comes through budget with our own money without attachments and i have no reason to believe that that will not be the case this year i raise it because there is no reason as i have said to the speaker and as i have said to our appropriators why the district should not be the first rather than the last budget that comes from this house where after all it is not the money of the federal government it is the money of district residents the city was closed down for a week during the government shutdown in the middle of its own financial crisis one can imagine the bitterness that was left with district residents when as far as they were concerned it was their money and it should not have been up here at all the delays in our budget cost us in interest when we have to borrow because of the uncertainty the market believes is there when what our council and our mayor have done has to go to yet another legislative body and one not as familiar with the city because it is not their particular budget some of my colleagues were not here so i raise it so that they know what has happened in the past and so that we can make what i hope will be a clean break with that kind of past i believe that there is signal evidence that that kind of break has already been made as the session opened i introduced the first of a series of bills the series is called democracy now and the first bill was called d c democracy 2000 it seeks to sunset the control board the board that was necessary when we got into financial trouble early because we are no longer in financial trouble and it sought to return some powers that were taken from the mayor and the city council to the mayor and the city council while the second part of the bill was not ripe because the new administration had no track record the part that would sunset the control board that is i believe that the first part was ripe and that there was no reason why the takecharge new mayor of the district should not have what it takes to rebuild the city to his credit and with much appreciation from me the gentleman from virginia the chairman of the subcommittee took the first part of my bill and brought it through subcommittee and then the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from california through full committee and then on to this floor where it easily passed in the house as well and i am pleased to report this evening that my bill or the first part of my bill which in fact became a davisnorton bill has become pl1061 that dash 1 means it is the first bill of the 106th congress to be signed by the president of the united states how appropriate that the first bill that a democratic mayor signe~d was a bill that the republican house and senate passed to return democracy to the mayor to the mayor and the city council we are most appreciative we think it bodes well for the congress and for the district and it is what i mean when i say the district has to realign itself and the congress has to realign itself and i believe that that shows that both bodies are in good faith trying to do exactly that now i did not and have not yet pushed for the second half of d c democracy 2000 as i have indicated because i think it is only fair to ask even a new mayor who has the confidence of the house to get his own track record before our sunset or seek to have the control board to sunset a year early my how i would wish however that as the year 2000 dawns the district of columbia can be free of any oversight except this congress that would mean that the control board would go a year early let me indicate why i think that should happen it is not simply because we have a new mayor in which i believe everybody residents of the district of columbia and congress alike have confidence it is because the evidence is already on the table the congress through the control board statute indicated that the district could be rid of the control board if at the end of four years the city had a balanced budget let me tell my colleagues what the record is the district has already had not one balauced budget and that was three years ahead of time but three balanced budgets plus surpluses in each of those three years a 185 million surplus in 1997 a 444 8 million surplus in fiscal year 1998 and the city projects a 158 million surplus for fiscal year 1999 as if that were not enough in the way of surpassing the expectations of the congress we had put into the revitalization package that this body passed taking over state functions in 1997 a provision that would allow the district to borrow in the fourth year if it had a balanced budget on the one hand but we had not quite been able to get rid of an operating deficit that it has been carrying now for years but the district of columbia is going to be able to eliminate its 322 million operating deficit from its own revenues without any borrowing this is strong evidence that the district has not only met but surpassed congressional expectations and is no longer in an emergency or crisis status and when one is no longer in an emergency status one no longer needs a control board a control board is an emergency mechanism it is not a security blanket no city gets it or must have it unless it is in an emergency the district has pulled itself out of a financial crisis in a way no one would dare to have predicted a couple of years ago nevertheless i can understand that to pass the second half of democracy 2000 the burden is going to be on me it always is and therefore i have not requested of the gentleman from virginia even hearings yet on the second half of that bill that would sunset the control board rather with a new administration that took office only in january it is only fair to let the mayor get his steam up show what he can do and then have hearings and see whether or not this bill can pass the house and the senate is the evidence on the table that this new mayor is in charge of the city and does not need any oversight from any one except the voters of the district of columbia i think the evidence is very clear already i think we need to see it continue for a few more months but it is very clear already members have come up to me came up to me after this first big snow the other day and told me that they noted the very quick and efficient way in which the streets were cleaned and that it was in contrast to some other experiences that they had had let me cite the way in which the new administration gets hold of problems because he cannot promise us that there are not huge numbers of problems left over the real question is is he in charge of them does he gain control of them do we have an administration that knows how to get rid of problems because the fact of problems are going to be there for some time an example is an article in the washington post a series exposing problems in homes for retarded people the district did a very good thing in taking retarded people and other disabled people out of a huge monstrosity of an institution taking them out of institutionalized care and spreading these disabled people in homes around the city well the washington post did what they were supposed to do they went around and looked at these homes and these homes have been in existence now for 3 or 4 years and they are private homes all around the city run by contractors and it found evidence that some of them are not treating retarded people very well and that is itself i will not say criminal but it is pretty close to it when we consider that we are talking about people that are pretty close to helpless there was a time when there would be exposure of problems like that and then we would wait to hear word that something had happened well the articles ran a couple of days ago this mornings paper said that the mayor has moved in already to debar two of the contractors in two of the homes and to move the people out that is what i mean by take charge that is what the congress cannot do what the control board cannot do that is what only a fully empowered mayor can do and what with his powers fully intact he is now doing there are many many examples of management progress in the city let me just take two the first being perhaps the institution most exposed to the public and about which the public most cares because they affect their lives so directly schools this may be the institution in the district where the congress has had the greatest concern the public schools to say they have done very poorly is to speak far too lightly of schools that deserve nothing but contempt for what they had done to our children what has happened in the district now is that a new bold energetic collegial superintendent named arlene ackerman has come to the superintendency and things began to happen immediately her summer stars program will probably be a model for the country where she took children and said in order to eliminate social promotion they were to go to summer school and that if one wanted h1460 cc to get ahead one could also go to summer school so that the children were not stigmatized and that there would be a ratio of 15 children to every teacher a very low ratio here is the kind of summer school that no one has ever seen much of it was oversubscribed and in the morning children were put to very intensive reading and math instructions and in the evening or afternoons she was able to get funding from private sources to take these youngsters all around the region to cultural and fun activities that would otherwise have been unavailable to them even before she began with the summer stars program she had so changed the regime in the schools with respect to how teachers were to confront their job that the scores in every grade had risen significantly it can be done if we have the right people in charge arlene ackerman is so good that i am sure some members would like to steal her and we will not let that happen because that kind of progress from a school system that was in the gutter it was so bad to so quickly see it come up in the hands of somebody who knows what she is doing is precisely what this city has needed let me takeanother agency that of course is of great great concern the police department the district went out and did a nationwide search and got itself a firstclass polide chief they got him from a much larger city chicago they got a police chief whose reputation has been made in community policing no approach is more popular in this body than community policing where we put the police on the ground they get to know people they get to deal with problems at the ground level and we get rid of crime chief ramsey has brought his community policing and his management style from chicago to the district and we arealready seeing the kind of control and innovation that had been absent for too long for example the chief instead of having what we used to in most cities which is the command sitting in headquarters has moved the command into the field so that one can hold cops accountable because the command is not somewhere downtown the command is right there in the neighborhood this man means it when he says community policing tha does not mean just a cop on the street it means everybody is involved in community policing troubled police department slow to take down crime it is finally going down significantly in the district and it was before even this police chief came but here is a man who knows how to keep that progress going with a real live management style that trucks no excuses an example he found a police department that according to again a series of articles had excessive shootings"],

superintendent of my states schools for 8 years in north carolina i know firsthand how important it is and i know about many of the amazing stories wonderful stories that have occurred and are occurring every single day in our public schools too many times we hear about the problems and we do not hear about the successes we tend to want to talk about those problems and not acknowledge that the majority of our children are good youngsters they do a good job they work hard our teachers are working hard and they deeply care about the young people they work with just this past weekend i had the opportunity to be with almost 100 of them in a group in north carolina and i will talk about that again in just a few minutes but i would say to my colleagues that if america is going to h1740 col seize the opportunity of this new economy we talk about the digital age that we are entering congress must provide some national leadership in this most vital effort too many times we say well it really is not a national issue we ought not to get involved in it we ought to be doing something else and education is important but it ought to be left here or there the truth is it is all of our responsibilities federal state and local and having been at the state level as a county commissioner prior to being a state legislator and a superintendent i can tell my colleagues that the bulk of the money continues to come from the local and state level it always will as it should and the decisions by and large will be made there but if we had not had programs at the federal level for children with special needs then they would not be taken care of the way they are today and we still are not funding that adequately there are a lot of other areas that we need national leadership on certainly education is one of those areas that i think that we need it there was a time in this country when we did not pay a lot of attention to roads or water and sewer and then we recognized it was an important national issue and it still is today and education is one of those across this great country the american people are calling for a greater investment in our public education system they are also calling for accountability this congress had an opportunity to do that last year and would not step up the way they should this past week we talked about the whole issue of the republican leadership and last year they dealt with it the republican leadership wanted to put together a voucher plan providing vouchers which in my opinion is not the way to improve education for all of our children it is really a joke and a hoax on most of them it will provide an opportunity for only a few and it will pump billions of dollars of tax money into financing areas that is so badly needed for our children in the public schools i happen to believe that that is absolutely wrong it would drain those resources from the public sector that is badly needed and leave too many children behind in my opinion condemned to a bleak future of failure as i was starting to say a few minutes ago with about 90 some young people high school students i was meeting with this weekend a variety of young people across our district where we were talking about the needs of what we ought to do about school violence it was amazing the answers these young people came up with one of the issues they focused on was the need for quality facilities and resources in those schools how do you tell a student that education is important when they do not get a textbook until 3 or 4 months into the year how do you tell them it is important when the toilets do not work in the bathroom how do you tell them education is important when all they have in the classroom on a fairly regular basis are substitute teachers because they do not have enough regular teachers in the classroom for a variety of reasons we are not paying them enough we are not attracting them we are not making the quality of where they work and that is where teachers work and students learn and work they have to be quality facilities that is important you can say that isnt the most important thing i would say to you if you look across this country at what we value we normally have nice buildings the buildings that we value they say a lot about what we care young people can pick that up very quickly my colleagues and i who are participating in this 1hour special order this evening we happen to have i think a better idea we want to invest in a national commitment to educational excellence whereschools are accountable to taxpayers for raising standards and every child has an opportunity to learn my colleagues who have heard me talk about this before know that i not only believe that but i have worked that as a state official and as a state legislator because if you look at north carolina you are looking at one of the school systems in this country that really is holding our system accountable and of all the states in the nation they are showing some of the highest growth in academic scores and accountability of any state in the nation it takes a total commitment on the part of everyone improving education in this country is about creating a classroom environment where children can learn and teachers can teach we need to foster greater connection between students teachers and parents and i might say the broader community schools in most communities are have been and still are that center focal point and they need to be more so in the future our schools can do better and with our help they will do better because that is where the future of america is that is where the future of our states are and where the future of our communities are they are in our classrooms today children do not know what they need many times unfortunately in school they only know what they get unfortunately in some cases they are not getting what they ought to get for a variety of reasons one of which may be the community does not have the resources to invest in other cases the community is not willing to invest those resources that in my opinion is shameful if that should happen one of the best ways that we can improve education is to help provide smaller class sizes that are orderly and disciplined and where children can get additional attention from their teachers who really can ignite that spark of learning the thing that teachers call the teachable moment when the child really gets turned on to learning as i met with those roughly 80 to 90 students this weekend and we were talking about school violence one of the issues they talked about was how do we get smaller class sizes how do we get in a class where we really know that our teachers care and gives us the time we know they care about us but she has so many students to take care of she cannot give me the individual attention that i need these were some pretty bright students as are most of our students but there are some who need that special attention to catch up and to keep up not all of us learn math as fast as others not all of us do as well on composition so there are a lot of ways that we need it but if we have smaller class sizes we can do a better job for our children i happen to believe we do a better job for ourselves because the information age of the 21st century is going to require that all of us be able whether we want to or not no matter what our age is incidentally we are going to have to be able to be on the internet we are going to have to be able to type we are going to have to be able to compose and we are going to have to send information back and forth it is so critical and so important i think one of the best ways we can do it is follow through on our commitment to reduce class sizes we started that with the presidents initiative a couple of years ago we have to fight for it every year and certainly what we do here it will set the tone for the country it is not the dollars that we need because they still are going to come at the local level but we can leverage the federal money to make a difference and i think that is important we need a new national commitment to the notion that parents in america have the right to expect that their children will have the best teacher in the world how do we do that we certainly do not do it by cutting education funding that is the first thing we do not do we do not do it by talking about how bad our teachers are we talk about how do we make them better how do we provide staff development for those teachers that are in the classroom we can do that i know as a state superintendent one of the things that once you have a tight budget one of the first things you start to see is staff development gets cut retraining of teachers no business in this country in their right mind would cut out the resources to retrain their staff especially at a time when they want to expand their product line what are we saying to our teachers and students you have got to teach technology you have got to teach math you have got to teach computer skills you have got to do composition we keep adding more on but we do not want to give them the resources to get the job done too many times we say well what we really need to do is you need as a teacher to go after school and learn how to be a better teacher that is what we do in many places in america or you do it on a weekend or you do it in the summer on your own time the last time i checked teachers are not paid 12 months of the year in most places in this country they are paid either 9 months and if they are real lucky they may get paid 10 months and spread it out we have to get serious about this business of educating our children if we are going to be serious then we have to make a new renewed national commitment to education in this country providing support for our teachers is more than just providing resources that is one of the most critical one of the toughest tasks that anyone will do i would challenge every member of the united states congress if they really think education is an easy job go in the classroom and spend a week do not go spend an hour as a visitor and walk through and smile and say im glad to be here and have someone put on a performance for you go in at 7 or 7 30 in the morning and have bus duty when you finish bus duty then you go to the classroom and you teach when you get a break you have hall duty you get through with hall duty and get ready to go to the cafeteria and your children are eating you have lunchroom duty because you stand around and watch the students and make sure the paper gets picked up and they are behaving in that depending on their age level then when you finish depending on the school you may have tutoring duties after school is over in the afternoon and oh by the way then if there is a basketball game or a football game that night you may have duties assigned to you for that oh and by the way there is not additional money for that that is just part of your duties of being a teacher thank god that we have people who are willing to do it and teach our young people when we see those yellow buses running up and down the road on the weekend they may be going to a band concert or they may be coming back from an athletic event or they may be going to a science fair or a math fair or any number of things that our young people participate in on the weekends and the teachers and staff are volunteering yes there are parents and i am grateful for those parents who take the time and are willing to do it because we need parents we need every parent engaged i have often said if every child in america had one adult mentor be it one of their parents or their grandparents or someone who really and truly was their one individual that other person that would stand up and fight for them and make sure they got in the right class they got the right attention and they were bn a track to be all that they could be it would be a different education system in america and we would have a different country but not all children have that they depend on their teachers and counselors and others to help them so rather than these things that we talk about in this congress many times many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to bash teachers want to bash education i say we ought to hold them up and help them we ought to encourage them yes we ought to challenge them and when they are wrong we ought to point it out but not always bash them because they have too tough a job and we ought not be talking about block grants because i think block grants are many times in my opinion an irresponsible way to get out of our duties of providing the true resources that are needed in the classroom and in other areas for education 0 1 815 i believe that we do not have in this country any children that we can give up nor any children we can waste america is a great country i get frustrated sometimes when i hear people talking about how great the economy is what a terrific job this country is doing and how bad our public schools are really who are most of the people who are running our industries and doing all of these jobs in america they went to the public schools of this country what we need to do is help those who are there today so we will continue to have that growth we have more young people in public schools in america today than ever in the history of this country and that is why classrooms are just bulging at the seams schools are overcrowded and overloaded i went into a school in my district just last week the school is in its third year and they have 18 trailers outside the school now that is because it is growing so rapidly the communities are growing people are moving there as i often tell people from time to time we are glad to have people moving and we are proud to have them come to our state we have a great growth economy in the research triangle park area one of the great dynamic hightech centers in america but there is something about when people move there they have a tendency to bring their children with them as they should and that puts additional pressure on our schools and local governments and that is true across america because we have a very mobile society a more mobile society today than we have ever had in history we have to make sure that our systems fit it and that we have opportunities for young people as we talk about this idea of vouchers and block grants i think we need to get that out of our vocabulary and get back to what is really important how do we help teachers how do we help children and how do we help our educational system become what it needs to be to provide for the challenges that we are going to face in the 21st century we must make every neighborhood public school in america work we must make every neighborhood public school in america work and we can if we are supportive and engage the community the business community the civic community and the parents in those schools we can make them work i have a bill and a number of my colleagues have others like the school construction bill that i have that will provide resources to the local units of government what it does is that the state governments will have it and they will not have to pay the interest that will be picked up at the federal level they only pay back the principle they decide where the schools are going to be built and how they are going to be built it will not solve the whole problem of 100plus billion that are needed for our schools for renovation and new schools but what it will do it will send a powerful signal to america that our public schools are important and we are going to engage at the federal level and we do care and we are going to make a difference i have another bill that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have signed on to and it is entitled character education i will talk about that again in just a few minutes a third one that we are involved in on both sides of the aisle the speaker and minority leader gephardt and speaker hastert appointed 24 members on a youth violence task force i want to talk about that also in a few minutes i think these items are very important to us as we look at education and where we want to go this whole issue of character education is a critical piece and what this legislation does and let me hold up for my colleagues a chart because we have used this and we really started this in north carolina in about 1989 we did a survey at that time of our public schools we surveyed about 25 000 students and one thing we found from that survey is a large number of our students did not respect number one their fellow students and in some cases their teachers it was an alarmingly high percentage so we felt it was something we ought to do so we started out with a panel of citizens teachers superintendents judges lay people ministers and others and we came up with what we call ethics education well we did not really like what we were doing on that we kept playing with it in about 1993 we finally finalized it to be character education at the vanderbilt university and other places and came up with a number of character traits that we felt were the core issues and shared it with all of our public schools there are seven of these now the truth is that systems can enlarge on it and did the basic ones that we laid out were respect citizenship justice and fairness honesty caring responsibility and trustworthiness so what we did as we worked on our curriculum we asked that each school that was involved integrate that into their curriculum we did not want to have an additional addon for the teachers they had enough to do so what they have done is tied that into when they are teaching math when they are teaching history or science or whatever they may be teaching that day they pick out one of these characteristics and as the year goes on whichever ones they have agreed on that becomes an important part of the students curriculum and they have signs that they put in the school but let me say to my colleagues before they agree to do it the community comes in and agrees on the numbers of the different items of the character traits that they are going to use in that individual school system now normally it winds up being the whole lea and it may be depending on the size of it in north carolina anywhere from 3 000 all the way up to the biggest school system with about 110 000 but what it does is amazing we see the discipline problems go down in those schools i was in one in four oaks about a month ago talking with the principal the number of discipline problems have gone down by almost a third and the academics went up on the part of the students in that school we say well why would that happen easy when they start respecting one another they respect their teachers they understand they have a responsibility to do their homework they have a responsibility to one another they care about themselves they have citizenship responsibilities and this starts to be a part of what we are talking about there is nothing wrong with this being a part of public education as it should be of every education of a good education we get away from these issues that tend to divide us when we talk about whether or not we can have prayer in school or whether or not we can have these other issues that become constitutional issues what we ought to be talking about is something we can do something about to make a difference for children in america and make sure that our education system is the best it can be because when we talk about public education we ought not to be dealing with division we ought to be dealing with addition how do we add to what we have done to make it better for all children we have a chance in this congress now that we have some resources to make sure that social security is fixed we start paying down the debt and we invest in the future of our children and we can do it by putting resources out there and do some school construction i am going to talk about that in a minute at this time i want to yield to the gentleman from wisconsin my friend who has been a real leader in this congress who serves on the

reflections that i think are in order because we cannot just sign this piece of paper and pretend that we can move on pretend that we have peace because the truth is that problems could arise and we could end up in a multiparty land war right in the middle of the balkans with our young men and women put in grave danger i would like to take this discussion tonight to another level which goes beyond the fine print of agreements which inevitably are lost and goes to higher principles this is an appropriate time to reflect on the lessons that we have learned in the balkan war and to take those lessons and transform them and to transform these thoughts of war into thoughts of peace and turn the thought of peace into the reality of peace and to speak to higher principles which this country has the ability to create so that we can continue in our historic quest to be the light of the world to be what the prophet spoke of as the shining city on a hill resplendent in our commitment to all human values to evolve into a country which can win the peace without finding it necessary to take up arms to win a war the values which are enshrined in the declaration of independence animate our concern for each other and for people around the world these words ring in the hearts of americans we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness these values these ideas these ideals are so powerful that they cause others to rise up in defense of their own rights all over the world we americans love democracy and it hurts us when we see tyrants imposing death or death of hope on peopleanywhere in the world recent humanitarian catastrophes have occurred and the united states did not intervene 80 000 dead in algeria 10 000 dead in the ethiopianeritrean war in a recent month 820 000 dead in rwanda over 5 years 1 5 million dead in sudan in the first 15 years 40 000 kurds dead at the hands of turkish forces 200 000 people killed in east timor by indonesian forces these tragedies have befallen our brothers and sisters around the world people we surely care about but people we did not help people who died while the world watched we have the strongest nation in the world yet with that strength through great difficulty we learned to exercise the greatest discretion in the use of force because once that force is used the consequences cannot be predicted sometimes the very people we intend to help may end up being hurt such a dilemma has faced us in the bal kans we have advanced here a doctrine of humanitarian intervention by all fair accounts that intervention has produced conditions which are worse than they were before we began our involvement ethnic cleansing was being undertaken against the kosovar albanians natos bombing accelerated it serbian paramilitary attacks cause masses of kosovar albanians to flee the province natos bombing turned masses into a great human tide seeking to flee the war serbian paramilitary forces destroyed the homes and villages of kosovar albanians natos bombing widened the area of destruction today there will be a semblance of peace or a chance for peace in kosovo but what kind of a peace it will be a peace which will have been gained at the cost of thousands of lives of innocent civilians of both sides it will be a peace where the province has been decimated by both sides by cluster bombs by booby traps by landmines it will harken to the comment that was made in another war we have created a desert and have called it peace certainly in a democracy our history has shown us that there are some things worth standing up for i think the most important thing that any one of us can do in life is to stand up and to fight for those things we believe in in this country we believe in freedom of religion we hate to see that freedom denied to anyone anywhere else in the world yet that freedom is being denied today in china in east timor in burma in north korea and in other nations and that bothers us as americans in the united states freedom of religion is essential to our democracy it is first in our amendments it is first in our hearts people come from all over the world here to find freedom of religion to follow that truth that resonates with their own hearts americans fought for that right indeed it is a human right this freedom of religion means that all may pray and worship that no one is forced to worship any faith except that which they believe that the state sponsors no religion but respects all religion this is apowerful principle of freedom of religion we separate church and state in america but separation and such separation by our founders was never meant to imply that we should separate the practice of government from high principles or the actions of government from spiritual principles our motto in the united states as we all know is in god we trust that motto is not simply the recognition of an external transcended reality it is a communion of the nation with the angels it has become a clarion call for moral leadership if we truly trust in god then each of us must become as moral leaders if we trust in god each of us can summon a transcendent morality spiritual awareness enkindles the power of the human heart which brings to each of us love which transcends all love which heals all love which comforts all love which sees all love which forgives all love which conquers all love which speaks to all love which you hear love which you can feel love you can touch love you can see and then we comprehend understanding and we are able to touch the wings of angels that appeal to sense in essence transcends language when we communicate with each other through the heart love speaks to all languages the language of the human heart speaks through all languages now in christianity the highest commandment is to love one another love yourself love your neighbor as yourself as we affirm love in our hearts we affirm the future and the future is in turn revealed to us because a heart filled with love is like a magnet that draws to it the love that it desires what the heart seeks the heart finds what the heart asks for the heart receives if the heart asks for peace its prayer will be answered so will be the prayer be answered if it asks for war the doors at which the heart knocks on are open as we affirm love in our hearts we affirm truth and eternity is revealed to us when this war in the balkans first began i felt this illogic of war grip this capitol it was as a physical force whirling like a vortex the start of war words of war actions of warproduce war we can be cocreators of our own world so as we are near the end of what we can only hope be the last war of this century it is time to ask what kind of a world do we want in the next century and how can we avoid the wars of the next century how can we build the peace of the next century we want a world of love a world of hope a world of joy a world of prosperity a world where all may worship a world where all may live a world where all may strive a world where all may grow a world of peace many of us have come to america indeed many of my constituents have come to america from different nations that is one of our strengths in this country our diversity the motto which soars above this majestic chamber speaks to the unity of one people e pluribus unum out of many one that is why it is so painful for we americans to watch people suffering anywhere in the world because they happen to have a different religion a different race a different ethnic group a different political philosophy we come here from many nations we share a common destiny as brothers and sisters of a common planet what kind of a world do we want only through the application of higher principles can we hope to have our systems of government forsake war and destruction and to make the survival of each person a sacred commitment in this world of strife and war we are called upon to be channels of peace in this world of darkness we are called upon to bring light in this world of fear we are called upon to bring courage in this world of despair we are called upon to bring hope in this world of poverty much poverty let us bring forth plenty in this world of ignorance let the light of knowledge light the world in this world of sorrow let us use our spiritual principles to bring forth joy in this world of judgment certainly we are asked to bring forth mercy it is through the heart that we connect with all humanity it is through the heart that we connect with the infinite these are principles that transcend governments governments kneel before these principles the congress of the united states even this congress is nothing next to these principles the government of any country is humbled before these principles it is through the human heart that we meet injustice and we transform it and through the application of spiritual principles we change the world we have throughout the last few months employed doctrines which are decidedly not spiritual in an attempt to solve our international problems in the balkans these doctrines speak to our limitations as a nation limitations which may burden us today but limitations which we can jettison and which can fall away from our conscience actions like the separation of a stage of a rocket falling back into the atmosphere as the capsule of destiny rockets higher and higher towards the stars but back on earth we ought to inspect those doctrines which keep us earthbound which will make it impossible for us to have real peace the doctrine of the end justifying the means nato has bombed civilians nato has bombed a civilian structure nato has helped to destroy a civil society with its bombs now the ends which nato has sought to achieve the end of ethnic cleansing the dislodging of a powerful dictator we have to ask if the ends have justified the means as one russian leader asked us when we were in vienna would in fact it be a proper pursuit of peace if their government had decided to drop a nuclear bomb on a unitedstates city so we need to inspect this doctrine of the end justifying the means we need also to inspect the doctrine of might makes right now i happen to believe that in america the law is what makes right yet in this conflict we have seen the united nations charter which this nation was proud to lead the world in organizing violated by an organization which saw fit to take the law into their own hands because they did not want to go through the united nations a united nations which we recognize at this moment had to have been instrumental in finally bringing about an agreement in the balkans the united nations charter states that its primary purpose was to save succeeding generationsg from the scourge of war it states in its article iv that all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations if might makes right the u n charter does not mean anythink if might make rights the north atlantic treaty signed in 1949 article i may mean nothing article i states the parties undertake as set forth in the charter of the united nations to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations so from the united nations that principle flowed into the north atlantic treaty but if might makes right the north atlantic treaty means nothing if might makes right the hague conventions of 1907 which prohibit penalizing a population for someones acts means nothing if might makes right the geneva convention of 1949 which prohibits attacks on objects indispensable for the survival of a civilian population such as an electric system water system sewer system if might makes right the geneva convention means nothing if might makes right the 1980 vienna convention which bars coercion to make nations sign agreements means nothing because the federal republic of yugoslavia was told at rambouillet that they would either sign that agreement or be bombed so we need to inspect this doctrine of might making right and we need to also as we inspect it determine whether the constitution of the united states itself has the meaning which its founders imbued in it when it said in article i section 8 that the congress shall have the power to declare war and notwithstanding my affection for the person who holds that office right now i have to ask whether or not the war powers act was violated and whether or not the constitution of the united states itself was violated in this pursuit of an exercise of power if might makes right perhaps even the constitution is without meaning we have to also as we review this war determine whether or not the doctrine of retributive justice an eye for an eye is to stand that by killing people we teach people that it is wrong to kill people when we advance such a doctrine we end up in a moral culdesac we find ourselves chasing into a darkness and unable to extract ourselves from it the idea of vengeance is something that is a very old idea in the literature of beowulf from many many years ago the concept of wergild was that if you did something to somebodys relative that other family had the obligation to come back and kill one of yours yet we were told that in this wonderful book we know as the new testament that there was a new law brought forward that the law of an eye for an eye was no more vengeance is mine said the lord i will repay and if we have confidence in that doctrine in the belief that there is a higher power who judges all and dispenses justice then we have to ask about our feeble efforts to render justice through retribution and look at this doctrine of retributive justice in this war we get the opportunity to inspect the doctrine of collective guilt that just because people happen to live in a country which is governed by a tyrant which is governed by an individual who does not support basic human rights of an important minority group in his country that because of that everyone in that country is guilty we need to look at that doctrine because behind that doctrine is a sense of punishment which nato apparently felt it had to mete out to the people of serbia taking over 2 000 lives of innocent civilians we must look at that doctrine rf collective guilt we must look at the doctrine of collateral damage i have been in meetings in this congress where the idea of collateral damage was brought forth and if one did not listen carefully enough one would not be aware that it meant killing innocent civilians that phrase means the death of innocent civilians and so in this war we have developed an acceptance of the idea of collateral damage but these are people these are innocent civilians who were killed people going to visit their relatives while riding on a passenger train people riding a bus to work or to go to the market refugees in a convoy trying to get out of a wartorn country people sitting in their homes eating dinner people in factories just trying to do their work people like us who were just trying to live and yet they become collateral damage they do not even have names they do not even have descriptions they are deprived of their humanity and when they are deprived of their humanity we deprive ourselves of our own humanity so we need to look at this doctrine of collateral damage we need to look at the doctrine of accidental bombing how many times could we hear over and over and over again it was an accident that we blew up these innocent civilians an accident i mean if any one of us driving a car found ourselves over and over and over again getting into accidents two things would happen we would not be insured any more and a court would take our license away and so should natos license to prosecute a war against a civilian population be taken away because there are no accidents when the accidents keep repeating themselves the doctrine of necessary distortion of meaning george orwell knew well this conflict the idea of peace bombs a peace war bombing for peace does violence to cognition and does violence to the commitment that this nation has as a people to speak plainly to those we represent to tell them the truth of what is going on to do it in language which is clear and sparkling so that no one can mistake what our intentions are and to not distort meaning indeed in listening to an earlier discussion about the culture of violence in our society is it any wonder when we send out so many conflicting messages about the violence which is wreaked by international organizations that the children of any nation would be confused about violence being visited in their own midst and one other doctrine we need to inspect is the doctrine of creation of enemies i remember years ago when i was a student at saint aloysius an elementary school in the city of cleveland the united states was in a conflict with russia it was called the cold war and we used to do drills in school in the fifth grade some of my colleagues will remember those drills they were called duck and cover we were told that we should expect that at some time there was this possibility that a nuclear attack could be launched by russia at the united states and we were told that if only we would put our arms around our head and protect it and tuck our head deep into our lap and closed our eyes and prayed that when the flash came we would not be blinded and perhaps we could go back home after school president eisenhower himself knew in that era that such drills were folly because a nuclear strike would mean the annihilation of a major population so those drills were merely to try to assuage the fears of the american people about the cataclysm of a nuclear war but we felt throughout that time in the cold war that the possibility for destruction was there because enemies were being created and in that dialectic of conflict that went back and forth across the oceans we found ourselves fearing each other preparing to destroy each other and last month in the middle of this balkan conflict the leader of the yablako faction in russia said that the effort to blockade the port in montenegro was putting us on a direct path to nuclear escalation last week premier chernomyrdin of russia in an oped piece in the washington post stated that the world was closer to a nuclear conflict than at any time in this decade because of the balkan conflict russians were our enemies they became our friends and again we have tested that friendship and we began a repolarization trying to exclude them right from the beginnlng from this process of peacemaking which could have been made possible through the u n security council so many months ago as we create enemies we may fulfill the prophecy of destruction and we will bring ourselves to a nuclear confrontation we fear if we stay on that path of the creation of enemies we create enemies and then we are ourselves our own enemies we have met the enemy in the words of pogo and he is us because of this great concern which members of congress had 11 of us went on a mission of peace to vienna on april 30 to meet with leaders of the russian duma including vladimir luhkin a leader of the yablako faction who only weeks earlier had made this powerful statement about the nations being on a direct path to nuclear escalation and in vienna under the leadership of my good friend the gentleman from pennsylvania 11 of us sat down with leaders of the russian duma and began to work out a framework for peace to reestablish this amity which we have worked so hard for where only a year ago russian and american astronauts could work together in the same space program where a short few years ago russian and american astronauts could fly around the world together in the same space capsule we went to vienna at a time where some were challenging whether or not russian leaders and unitedstates leaders ought to be together in the same room and yet we took that step forward to apparently and quietly over a period of 2 days put together not an agreement between nations but a framework that could be used to take steps towards peace and unravel what looked like a concentration of war energy that was moving like a juggernaut across this world that was many many many weeks ago and in that time since then many opportunities toward peace were lost and many lives were lost and much damage was done to property and to peoples hopes and dreams there are times that people around the world depend on the united states as being a protector of human rights to rise and to defend the principles that are enshrined in our own statue of liberty in the harbor in new york city that that lady who holds the lamp in the harbor the encryption at the base which reads give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore send these the tempests to me i lift my lamp beside the golden door so i speak of bosnia now i had the opportunity to witness firsthand as a member of the united states congressional delegation the effects in bosnia of hatred and tolerance where muslim people were driven from their homes where there was an attempt to destroy people for what they believed in an attempt to destroy the homeland of muslim people i saw graves ringed with fresh marble i saw homes that had been blown up everywhere and everything riddled with bullets i met with people that had been driven from their villages by fear and terror and i met people that wanted to go home because home called them as home calls us all but fear put up a roadblock and governments put up a roadblock i met with the muslim women of srebrenica who lost their husbands who lost their fathers who lost their brothers who lost their children when 5 000 muslims were lined up and murdered only because they were muslims i met with dr sarich in sarajevo and learned of the difficulty placed in the path of muslims who simply wanted to return home in keeping with the dayton agreement i appealed to the state department and the justice department for the women of srebrenica i spoke on the floor of the congress for an appeal to the government of the united states to remember what happened in srebrenica and to maintain their commitment to the people of bosnia as they try to resettle and restore their country and to help bring those who are responsible for the atrocities in bosnia to justice indeed it could be said that the seeds of the current war in the balkans could have been sown because the world community failed to bring to justice those who committed war crimes because until they are brought to justice can there really be justice with respect to bosnia and to help find the missing and to help heal the broken families and broken hearts and to work with the assembled nations to help protect the peace and to help rebuild the civil society can that really be done if those who were responsible for creating that moment are not brought to justice the dayton agreement was merely a promise it is not a reality we must continue to work to make it a reality and it is the responsibility of the government of the united states to show leadership in the world and to make sure the promise of dayton becomes a reality i am not a stranger to the balkans i was in sarajevo i was in brzko i was in tuzla and i was also in croatia last year to visit family to hope to have a chance to see the place where my own grandfather was born a little town in eastern slovenia called botnoga where john kucinich was born many many years ago and i so much wanted to see the place where he was born and when i went to zagreb to visit with friends and relatives i learned that in botnoga there was no there there in fact the town had been leveled in the previous war with serbia and yet when i learned in that moment the feelings that i had felt strong feelings it occurred to me again do we move forward in this world hoping fo peace if we believe that there must be vengeance if we believe in an eye for an eye if we believe that every injustice which is done to us must be returned in full measure by us and so in my own way i was confronted with those feelings i do not think that any of us could say that we have suffered the kind of tragedy which the kosovar albanians have suffered and it is true that the world community has a responsibility to do everything it can to try to repair their shattered lives we had a moral responsibility to take steps that stopped the destruction of kosovo we have a moral responsibility to bring about a peaceful resolution there but i believe that right at the beginning our responsibility rested on understanding the primacy of international law as expressed through the united nations and through the u n security council and through the geneva convention and through the hague and through the united states constitution article 1 section 8 now ultimately military solutions are not adequate ultimately truly peaceful structures we can call them democratic structures must be in place we had that opportunity more than a year ago we remember when 100 000 people marched through the streets of belgrade protesting the regime asking for support asking for an opportunity to uphold democratic values asking for a chance to keep their media free to keep their exercise of basic rights as part of their ongoing civic life and yet that movement did not receive the support which the world community owed it but peaceful structures must be put in place notwithstanding the massive destruction and the international community has agreed to participate in the rebuilding of the federal republic of yugoslavia but with that rebuilding must come democratic structures so people can live people can worship people can work people can play and people can live out their lives and so it is appropriate for the state department working with the united nations to begin to work to negotiate transitional government structures to do less while simply giving lip service to humanitarian efforts is a cruel hoax it has been said before and it should be said again until the leadership in belgrade is replaced through a democratic process it will be very difficult to be able to have a lasting peace now the bible says you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free we have to be seekers of the truth about what happened in the balkans so we do not repeat the same mistakes and so that we can create new possibilities for peace let our country be seekers of the truth in our own land and in our own foreign policy so that we can all see the light when the light of truth shines through the darkness and the darkness will not overcome truth such is always the promise of america when we live by the ideals upon which this country was founded the ideals of truth the ideals of justice freedom of religion freedom of speech as we strive to become one nation with liberty for all one nation with justice for all one nation with freedom of speech for all one nation with freedom of religion for all let us remember that unity is something that all of us seek after a transcendent unity of higher purpose so let us strive for a government which strives for peace and let us have a government which protects the freedom of all to worship let us have a government which practices toleration let us have a government which stands against discrimination let us have a government which makes us always proud of our nation let us have a government which fulfills the promise of one of americas greatest presidents abraham lincoln who spoke of a government of the people by the people and for the people in america the beauty of this country is that we are always creating a new nation years ago we spoke of creating a nation conceived in liberty today we create a new nation again and in this new millennium which we are advancing towards we can create a new millennium where peace not war is the imperative begun in unity where those who seek truth where those who know truth and have found truth unite their thoughts across religions and cultures drawing from the universality of the human condition and the higher consciousness which is the impulse of a universe that calls us forward now there is real power in that kind of america power that transcends a 270 billion military budget there is real power in a kind of america where we live by our ideals where we stand by the spiritual principles which our founders held dear this recognition would lead us to create a harmony that would dissipate the inevitability of war and consecrate the inevitability of peace as we move towards a new millennium we can summon a new creativity and thought a new vibration and feeling a new consciousness which will help us create new worlds it is time for us to think in terms of studying peace as we would study war we have a war college there ought to be a college for peace we ought to spend more time in this country studying conflict resolution and mediation at local state and at the federal level so we can teach people even in the schools how to deal with their feelings teach people how to respect each others rights make ours a quest for something that we have not even been able to grasp a new condition for peace perhaps it is time for a department of peace as we have a department of defense where the impact of every government decision particularly with respect to the work of the department of defense is studied finely as to what its effect would be on peace i mean if 1 percent of the federal budget would be used for such a department 1 percent of the federal budget used for the military that is 1 percent of 270 billion we would have enough to make a major beginning in a new millennium towards promoting tolerance which comes from understanding because once people understand there will be more tolerance once people understand there will be more acceptance because acceptance follows knowledge and leads to the brotherhood and sisterhood of all we could move together to create peace not the peace of the grave which we are all too familiar with in the tragedies we have witnessed but the peace of a joyful life not just peace which is a cessation of war but peace which is something more innate peace which is inside each one of us peace inside which no one can take away an inner peace which we in turn give to the world peace on earth truly begins within each of us and that inner peace which makes each of us is a source of peace in the world which we extend to those who are persecuted which we extend to those who hate us which we extend to those whomisunderstand us which we extend to those until their hearts open up and their eyes open up my fellow americans our arms open up and we embrace each other as brothers and sisters and we hold each other in a triumph of love in a triumph of universal peace muslims christians jews buddhists

will hopefully join me here if they are of like mind and join in this discussion of what is the issue that is gripping america today and that is the issue of who will become the next president but more important whether we can continue to have confidence in the democratic institutions of this country now let me deal with some of the basics first the election last tuesday produced a very clear winner of the popular vote these were the results that were reported my colleagues can read the numbers here but gore re ceived almost a quarter of a million votes more than mr bush now i say a quarter million because i know that the vast majority of ballots that have yet to be counted even today are absentee ballots from the state of california i am from california it is my business to know how absentee ballots and particularly late absentee ballots are likely to come in i am confident that when those california votes are tabulated not only will mr gore have a lead of over 200 000 but a lead of 250 000 but that is the popular vote and we are a nation dedicated to the rule of law our law calls for the electoral college to operate but forthat college to operate there has to be a fair count and a fair vote in each state that is why we must turn our eyes to the state of florida where we will see a genuine contest one side in that contest is trying to seize power through political power chiefly through the power of the governorship of florida and the secretary of state of the state of florida two elected officials and is trying to malign the rule of law or rather just malign the court system which is pretty much the same thing see one can be a football coach who says i believe that football should be played by the rules but first we have got to kick all the referees off the field we all have been angry at a call by a referee i have been in stadiums where people yell kill the ref i have never quite joined in such a statement but imagine what football would be like if there were no referees or if there was an attempt to go to someone paid by one of the teams and have them arbitrate the disputes now our courts are not perfect but they are far less political let me tell my colleagues than those of us who are elected officials so i would hope that the courts of florida would ultimately and quickly resolve the issues that are before us now the main issue before us is how the votes in the counties of florida are going to be counted but before we get there i would like to focus a little bit on the ballot in palm beach county the famous butterfly ballot here is a picture of it we have all seen it it is confusing 19 000 people double punched on this ballot some of them had voted for buchanan by mistake and thought they could correct it by punching a hole for gore some of them saw two holes to the right of the democratic candidate and thought that if they wanted to vote for gore and lieberman they needed to punch both holes to the right some were simply confused by an array of arrows pointing in different directions left and right to a row of holes now it is said that the voters could have known about this ballot by looking at their sample ballot well with jut the holes this ballot tells one nothing a sample ballot comes in the names all seem to be there the people glance at it and decide who to vote for and then show up on election day to say that looking at the ballot without the holes is the same as looking at it with the holes is simply absurd but it is not enough that the ballot is confusing in fact i believe that there is a florida court decision that says that if a ballot is merely confusing the courts will not provide redress to those who were confused we are a nation of the rule of law but the florida courts were very clear when the supreme court of the state of florida ruled 2 years ago in beckstrom versus volusia county canvassing board that is volusia county canvassing board that where there is not only confusion as there clearly was in this case but also noncompliance with statutory procedures then the court must provide redress must adjust the election or allow for a new election if there is reasonable doubt as to whether the certified election expressed the will of voters and when that doubt extends to who won the election well there are more people in the cloakroom some of the times than the number of ballots that separates mr bush from mr gore in the vote in florida there is no doubt that any confusion in palm beach county could well have affected the result of the presidency of the united states there is no doubt that the ballot was confusing many on the day of the election before they realized how important it would turn out to be started complaining about that confusion there is no doubt that this ballot was in violation of florida law not just that it was confusing not just a vague law of florida that the ballot should be clear and unconfusing but two very specific statutes the first florida statute that is violated by this ballot is the one that requires that the names be on the left and the holes be on the right for every candidate for public office here as we see some of the names are on the left and the holes are on the right and sometimes the name is on the right and the hole is on the left now when one looks at that florida statute just reading through a statute book its wisdom is not all that apparent the reason for complying with the law may not be all that clear but it is by violating that law that the officials in palm beach county created the ballot that now has the whole world watching florida the second statute in florida also requires that the first ranking on the ballot the first listing and the first hole goes to the party that won the last gubernatorial election in florida that is the republican party my colleagues will notice the republican party on this butterfly ballot has the first listing and the first hole the second listing and the second hole is supposed to go to the party that came in second in the last gubernatorial election that is the democratic party as my colleagues can see well the democratic party does not have the second hole the democratic party has the third hole whether one views it as the second listing or the third listing depends upon whether one has a tendency to go from left then right or left columh and then right column but one thing is very clear this ballot does not award the second hole to the democratic party every voter in florida had the right to a ballot with the names on the left and the holes on the right every voter in florida had a right if they wanted to vote for the republican party to punch the first hole and if one wanted to vote for the democratic party for any office punch the second hole yet on this ballot the second hole is for pat buchanan that is why pat buchanan himself says that there are quite a number of votes hundreds or perhaps thousands in palm beach county alone that were registered as being for him but were not people who intended to vote for him so we are told that maybe there were not that many people confused well the number of people voting for pat buchanan in this county and in this particular precinct exceeded any imaginable count for pat buchanan even imaginable by him but there were not only the pat buchanan ballots but also those that were doublepunched now in every election there are people who just skip an office even the presidency they go in they say i do not like nader i do not like bush i do not know gore and i do not know who the workers world party is and i am not going to vote for any of them and they skip it i am not talking about people who completely skip the presidency i am talking about those who voted twice due to a confusing ballot now in the 1996 election far fewer people voted twice james baker spokesman for the bush campaign has tried to argue that there were 14 000 people who voted twice in palm beach county 4 years ago that is not just fuzzy math that is false math see that 14 000 figure is the sum of everybody in 1996 who just skipped the presidential race did not like dole did not like clinton just skipped it and those who doublepunched in fact the number who doublepunched last election was well less than half the number who doublepunched in this election this ballot was not only confusing it led to confusion so what do we do about it that needs to be determined and it needs to be determined in the courts of florida but when faced with a similar circumstance the courts have either ordered a new election or and i do not recommend this approach at all but florida courts have done it they have just statistically quote corrected the ballot count i do not think that is the way for the courts of florida to go in something as important as the presidency so i do not know whether the people of palm beach county will have their right to vote trampled upon by an illegal as well as confusing ballot and a refusal of the florida courts to grant a revote i know that that issue will not be reached for a while but before we allow our impatience with this process to govern its outcome let us remember how many americans have died for the right to vote not just in the suffragette movement not just in the civil rights movement but in every war america fought people fought and died for our democracy we can wait another week even another 2 weeks even 3 weeks in fact there is no particular rush at all on january 6 at 1 in this very room the electoral vote tallies from each of the 50 states and the district of columbia will be presented at that desk and they will be added up and tallied by the senate and the house of representatives assembled in this room on january 6 and if it takes florida till about then to be absolutely certain how its electoral college votes should be cast in a way that reflects the majority of voters what is more important our own impatience or our dedication to honor those who died to give us and to preserve for us a democracy now in talking about a revote which might be necessary in palm beach i am jumping the gun a little bit none of the candidates for president has called for such a revote because the focus now is just to accurately count the votes in the 67 counties of florida and here there has been an attempt by one politically elected partisan officeholder to thwart an accurate count that worries me i am talking about katherine harris secretary of state of florida who is also cochair of the bush campaign in florida unfortunately she seems to be wearing her hat as cochair of a campaign rather than as chief election officer because i will review all of the obstacles that have been placed by the office of the florida secretary of state in the way of an accurate vote of floridas counties i want to quote ms harris on one point ms harris is quoted as saying just a few days ago and i am reading from the palm beach post november 14 that she would be passionately interested in a federal post in foreign affairs or the arts if the governor of texas wins to that end according to this newspaper she not only campaigned for bush in florida but had gone to new hampshire where the associated press teports that she had been part of the freezin for a reason campaign of floridians flying to new hampshire to campaign for mr bush now i think it is just fine to campaign for someone to be president i did but my fear is that her selfconfessed and announced passion for a position in the bush administration is clouding her ability to carry out the prime responsibility of a states chief election officer and that is the accurate and fair conduct of elections passion for winning a post in the federal government should not control the decisionmaking process but i fear it has it is pretty well acknowledged that a manual vote is the right way to do a recount let me put to rest some of the mistaken beliefs first it is said oh this is the second recount the third recount the tenth recount not true under florida law and not at the request of the gore campaign or anybody associated with it the counties of florida did do a manual recount that is up to them the gore campaign requested only one recount in four of the 67 counties in the other counties they said fine go ahead we will not even request a re count so the gore campaign was in a position to request a recount in every county but it requested only four the bush campaign did not request a recount in any of those counties but that is not because as they claim they are so dedicated to the machinery being more accurate because many of us in this hall have been involved in elections and recounts and close elections involving punched cards and we all know as the governor of texas knows that the most accurate way to do a recount of a punched card election system is by hand with people from both parties examining the ballots now why is that true we live in an age where machines are praised and people are chided but in this case the invention of man the machine is not nearly as great as the creation of god first of all we are dealing with 1950s technology here this is no internet doublechecked modem this is a punch card this is 1950s technology and these machines we are talking about even if one votes properly doing everything according to the instructions punch the hole hard and straight through the card a chad can be left on that card sometimes partially attached sometimes hanging off the back sometimes hanging off the back and then in handling it it swiiigs back so that the machine cannot determine as a matter of fact the machine is erratic take a ballot that has been just slightly dimpled run it through the machine and sometimes it counts it sometimes it does not take a ballot where there is a swinging door chad on the back sometimes the machine counts the ballot sometimes not james baker has cried out for standards of course the counties of florida have their standards publish their standards train their employees by the standards do that training in front of a cable television camera for those who are glued to their sets and we know what those standards are in fact we can argue about those standards i believe the gore campaign argues in favor of counting a dimpled ballot and the people in palm beach florida may not be counting a dimpled ballot that is to say one where there is an impression but no perforation well we should know what the standards are we ought to try to agree on those standards and we ought to make sure that every challenged ballot is counted according to standards what standards does the machine have sometimes dimpled ballot yes sometimes not sometimes swinging door chad sometimes not the machine is not talking the engineers who made that machine are deep into retirement and they are not talking either counting these cards by machine may be fast but it is not the most accurate system now it is not enough for me to explain this because the governor of texas already made his decision in 1997 he signed into law a texas statute he signed it with his own pen a new clearer statute for the state of texas what does it say a manual recount shall be conducted in preference to an electronic recount what does that mean it means in texas if there are two candidates and both want a recount the candidate who wants a machine recount only has to post a bond from which the fee may be taken he may not get back his bond his money of 18 a precinct another candidate more interested in accuracy has to pay 30 a precinct as his or her bond and what if two candidates both want a recount the candidate who wants a manual recount is preferred that is to say not necessarily to win the election but the request for a manual recount has preference under the law of the state of texas why because george w bush when he signed this law knew full well that a manual recount while it may be a little more expensive and by god i think the presidency is worth 30 a precinct while a manual recount may be a little more expensive and time consuming it has preference because it is more accurate so why does james baker tell us to use machines he tells us that texas has standards and florida does not well first florida does have standards they simply vary from county to county but the palm beach standards are as good as the texas standards the broward standards are as good as the texas standards but if james baker was not trying to obstruct an accurate recount if he was hoping to have the votes counted accurately he would not be blocking a manual recount he would be aiding it andhow could he aid it let us read please show us because no one has seen them those supposedly in existence texas standards for dealing with these punch cards which they also use in texas do they count dimpled ballots in texas i do not know but i would like to know and frankly if james baker if george w bush can provide us with better standards let us see them but they have no interest in improving the accuracy of a manual count they want to block a manual count they refer to these machines as precision machines these are machines that jam if the ballot is bent a little bit the card is bent a little bit they deride human beings as in error even teams of three human beings working carefully with the tv cameras they deride that as being faulty and praise a machine that cannot read a bent ballot that would disqualify and disenfranchise one of our senior citizens who fought on normandy or iwo jima for the right of america to have a democracy for his right and our right to vote and his vote is going to be ignored by this supposed precision machine because well the ballot has a crease in it i cannot believe that the governor of texas would want to dishonor the oval office by sitting there only because creased ballots are not counted i cannot imagine that someone would want to be president in denigration of the votes of a majority of the states with a majority of the electoral college votes i understand he wants to be president and it is his right to be president if he does not have a majority of the popular vote nationwide but if he does not have a majority in states representing a majority of the electoral college then he dishonors the presidency by demanding it and he places his own desire for power above patriotism when he does everything possible to get a woman who is passionately dedicated to holding office in his administration to deny the most accurate vote count now i do want to deal with some of the other more extraneous issues that have come up but first i want to deal with one more aspect of the argument as to what is the best type of count the most accurate count you see we serve here in the united states congress and four republican candidates let me repeat that four republican candidates for congress have demanded and obtained manual recounts they were republicans they wanted to sit in these chairs and they got manual recounts by god if filling one of these chairs is worthy of a manual recount then certainly filling the chair in the oval office is worthy of a manual recount you see when john ensign wanted to sit in the united states senate in 1998 we gave him a manual recount or the state of nevada gave him a manual recount bob dornan got more than one manual recount peter torkildsen in 1996 demanded and got a manual recount and finally rick mcintyre in 1994 republican candidate got a man ual recount and throughout that process his cause was passionately advocated by then congressman dick cheney so dick cheney thinks that a manual recount is appropriate in filling a seat in this hall george bush signs a law in his own state saying that a manual recount has preference whether you are filling the governorship of texas or the lowest county clerk in the smallest county lowest or smallest county clerk in the smallest county but somehow obstacles are placed but i think ultimately these obstacles will be ineffective because ultimately the side of democracy will prevail and the same divine providence that has given us a democracy for these 200 years and many more will make sure that we have democracy in this election now first they went to federal court they attacked and vilified courts they have particularly attacked and vilified the federal courts those on the republican side often from this chamber they ran to federal court not for the purpose of seeking a more accurate count but for the purpose of demanding a less accurate count and the federal court turned them down and they turned around and they appealed to the 11th circuit a very republican very conservative federal court and i am confident that they will be turned down there as well because not only should a court not interfere to provide for a less accurate voting system but certainly the federal courts should not interfere in what under our constitution is very clearly a state matter then they went to the secretary of state and demanded a 5 deadline why to make sure that in volusia county they had to stay up all night to do the manual recount and make the deadline so then james baker could go on tv and say these human beings you cant trust them they were tired why were they tired because your person is imposing an unreasonable recount deadline particularly unreasonable given the fact that florida will not finish counting the absentee ballots from overseas until 5 friday so there is no speedup here of when florida will finish its vote tally the sole purpose is not speed the sole purpose is inaccuracy and they hope to achieve it so then a court in florida took a look at it and said okay all the counties can report their results by 5 today and then they can go back and do a manual recount should they desire and if they are dedicated to democracy they will and then report that as a supplemental report it will then be up to ms harris to decide whether her passion for a federal office exceeds her dedication to an accurate vote count because then she will be confronted with whether to ignore this report or whether to record it but if she arbitrarily and in passion for federal office decides to ignore an accurate count i am confident that the courts of florida will order her to do the right thing this election is too important to be decided by ms harris interest in a position in the arts or in foreign affairs in the federal government there is one other point i want to make and that is we are told that we should ignore the problems in palm beach county because the press said some things they should not have said at around 20 minutes before the polls closed in the florida panhandle keep in mind a decade or two ago the press would routinely report all through the day their exit polls and they would call states in the 1970s and the 1980s they would call them just as soon as they could whether the polls had closed in part of a state or none of the state or all of the state i am not prepared to throw out all the elections in the 1970s and 1980s just because the press did not have the good ethics which they have tried unsuccessfully to adopt for this election but if we are going to start equating illegal ballots on the one hand to false press reports on the other i would ask everyone to just make a mental checklist of how many false press reports we have had prior to the election after the election are we going to disqualify the election just because at least to my way of thinking the press misreported the economic effect of bushs social security plan the press has a constitutional right under the first amendment to say what it wants when it wants where it wants and the fact that they violated their own internal rules adopted by some of them and not by others apparently is no reason to throw out an election any more than the many times when the press violated its own rules of ethics by shifting a little bit this way or a little bit that way in a news report that should have been straight down the middle i see that i have been joined by the gentlewoman from texas before i yield to her i will ask how much time i have remaining"], [0.00018996000289916992, 0.9998100399971008, 1, "i yield myself 15 minutes before i get into my explanation of this bill i want to take a moment to do something i think is very important this institution takes a lot of abuse but there are some people in this institution who do a tremendous job on behalf of the taxpayers and they deserve no matter how rushed the members are they deserve to be recognized i want to start by thanking the committee staff on our side of the aisle mark mioduski and cheryl smith who have worked so incredibly hard all year on the laborhealth bill cheryl not only handles education programs for the minority but she does the transportation bill as well and i know that there were occasions when they went 22 days or more without a single hours sleep in order to serve this house this committee and its members and i am very grateful i want to thank mark murray who does a terrific job handling both the foreign operations bill and the legislative branch appropriations bill dave kilian who has virtually single handedly handled the defense bill on our side of the aisle tom forhan who handles both the military construction bill and the district of columbia bill dave reich and mike stephens who worked together on vahud and in addition dave handles the agriculture bill and mike handles the interior bill sally chadbourne and pat schlueter worked together on the commercejusticestate bill sally also does the energy and water bill and pat does the treasurypostal bill none of these people would be nearly as effective if it were not for the tireless efforts of mr bonner who undoubtedly works as hard as any human being on capitol hill and jade brennan who was been here early in the morning until early the next morning day after day and night after night and i would also like to thank kori bernards who has coordinated our communications efforts too and norris cochran and christina hamilton who have helped out in numerous ways this small group of people had to deal literally with every funding issue in every department and agency and program of the entire federal government they have had to help members with their particular problems with government programs and very often have had to deal with the wrath of authorizing issues that have nothing to do with the appropriations but nonetheless get dumped into our bills as a means of clearing them through both houses i think that the effort they put forth on behalf of this institution and particularly members on my side of the aisle is remarkable and i want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for their long hours their tremendous knowledge of our government and legislative process and the enormous commitment that they have made to making this government and this country a better place i also want to pay special thanks to the clerk of the committee jim dyer i do not think there is a single person on capitol hill who is more patient more fair or more pleasant to deal with on a daily basis in and out i can say without reservation that had it not been for his commitment and personal skill this agreement and many others would never have come together also helping the chairman and the entire committee in the front office are john mikel a first rate professional who for more than a decade has pulled the committee and the house through the thorny thickets of process and budgetrules and chuck parkinson has helped schedule our bills and coordinate with the committee on rules and the leadership minority dale oak who manage the massive job of tracking the hundreds of extraneous items that various members and other committees attempted to attach to this legislation and elizabeth morra and john schofield who have handled press for the majority dianne kane sandy farrow brian mabry and theo powell really make the committee work and they are a big help not only to the majority but to all of us on the committee and i want to especially recognize tony mccann the subcommittee on laborhealth clerk carol murphy susan firth geoff kenyon francine macksalvador and tom kelly of the subcommittee on laborhhs staff and all of the associate staff of the members of the laborhhs subcommittee on both sides of the aisle and i also thank steve cartesi the majority clerk on the senate side and jim english on the minority side and all of the other clerks and ranking members assistants as well on all of the other subcommittees who deal so well and with so much dedication i know that there are few people in this country who appreciate how hard all of these people work and how much of a contribution they make to their country and this institution but i want to say thank you to all of them and i am sure that that feeling is shared on both sides of the aisle now i would simply like to say this and i will say one more thing about one person before i move to substance the gentleman from illinois is leaving this institution after a distinguished career which would make any american proud and i have to say that whether i have served with him on the subcommittee on foreign operations or on the subcommittee on labor health and education he has invariably brought a high degree of thoughtfulness a high degree of fairness uncommon good judgment and good sense and immense dedication to the public good i can think of no better phrase than to repeat the phrase that we have heard so often well done good and faithful servant john has truly been a credit to this institution to his party to his country and to his district i want to lead us all in a round of applause for the wonderful work that he has done while he has been with us in this institution and now on to the substance on wednesday night the country heard two very good speeches on reconciliation from mr gore and mr bush both emphasized a need for bipartisanship unfortunately we serve in the institution which has suffered the greatest erosion of bipartisanship in recent years but this institution does in my opinion have a very good model for bipartisanship and that is the committee on appropriations even during the last 6 years we have been able to produce a significant number of bills on a bipartisan basis in all but one year the laborhas education bill has not been one of those bills that has not been the fault of the distinguished gentleman and my good friend the gentleman from illinois the subcommittee chairman nor has it been the fault of the gentleman from florida or his predecessor as full committee chair bob livingston they have struggled in the best traditions of this committee to reach across the aisle and to build the broadest possible consensus for each bill but because of the restrictions placed on them by the committee on the budget and their leadership their efforts have not often succeeded in my judgment this bill has been a poster child on how not to run a legislative body and in fact in this process a member of the majority side of the aisle earlier correctly noted that there are dozens of items in this bill that have nothing whatsoever to do with the appropriations bill in fact there are well over a hundred different authorizations that are being added to this bill by reference we did not negotiate those items we are not responsible for them all we can try to do with our limited staff is to try to make certain that they were not supremely objectionable to this or that faction in the house and i have to say that this is a spectacular example of how not to run a railroad this year has been especially frustrating to those of us who would like to see some of the most critical functions of government funded on a bipartisan consensus and the fact is that for 9 months of this year the deliberations of this committee were wasted on phoney budget resolutions that held funding for education held research worker protection and other critical programs in this bill at virtually last years funding level with no adjustment for inflation with no recognition of the new challenges facing this country and yet the majority passed the bill the senate recognized that was an unrealistic package when they passed a bill somewhat more in line with the nations needs in october we reached a bipartisan agreement that in my view met the needs of a changing and growing country but then that bill was blocked from coming to the floor by the majority party leadership both parties then went out and campaigned for the education and the health and worker protection programs that were in this bill but after the election the majority party leaders then demanded that this bill be cut by more than 3 7 billion before it could be brought backto the floor that is a demand they did not make of the interior bill that was almost 15 percent above last year or the transportation bill that was similarly way above last year and also a bill such as the energy and water bill which was substantially above last year to get an agreement in the last week we had to cut 3 7 billion from the earlier agreement we had to take 1 4 billion from advance funding for liheap we had to take 257 million out of handicapped education 127 million out of efforts to reduce class size 180 million out of afterschool programs and 200 million out of biomedical research i dislike all of those cuts and would point out that they were unnecessary both in terms of meeting the budget limits that congress imposed on itself in october and they were unnecessary in terms of passing this bill but nonetheless even with these changes i will support this bill for two reasons one because i have in essence a ministerial duty to do so sooner or later we have to resolve our differences and this is the day and secondly i think there are other good reasons to vote for this bill it now provides funding on a program basis that is nearly 15 percent higher than last year for critical education and health programs some people are alarmed by that i am delighted by it the overall increase in education in this bill is 18 percent it is a major step forward in providing local schools with the kind of resources that will facilitate the kind of change and improvement in our schools that the american people are anxious to see class size reduction efforts are increased 25 percent teacher quality efforts are increased 50 percent school renovation is funded at a 1 2 billion level for pell grants and i think this is perhaps the most important issue in the area of higher education in this bill we have the biggest increase in 25 years the pell grant going from a maximum grant of 3 300 to 3 750 to the very deep regret of our friend the gentleman from illinois we did not provide the 15 percent increase for nih that we had hoped to see we provided almost that much about 14 percent and i am hopeful we will ultimately see our efforts against disease doubled within the 5year time frame that will end in fiscal 2003 the most troubling cut in this bill for many members on this side of the aisle is the advance funding for the lowincome fuel assistance program which i just mentioned members need to recognize however that fuel assistance is funded for the current year not only at the full level provided last year not only at the request but at 300 million above the request i am convinced that will not be enough given current energy price increasesand longterm weather forecasts but it is 25 percent more than would be available if we had to go to a continuing resolution the deletion of that advance funding is unfortunate it carries with it certain risks that i am uncomfortable about it does not give state and local governments as much assurance about program levels for next year as would be desirable for planning purposes it does not assure that all of the money will be allocated next fall before cold weather hits but we have in the statement of the managers very firm commitments to work to overcome those problems and i intend to see that the leadership in congress and the new president will keep those commitments i would also note that there were over 400 authorizations which one party or another attempted to add to this bill we rejected almost 300 of them and of those that are in the bill you will have to talk to the authoriting committees to get a balanced evaluation because they largely negotiated them i have just one additional statement to make i love this institution i respect every member in it i love what it can do when it is at its best in doing things that are needed to help the people we represent but i honestly do believe that the way this bill was produced is a model of how not to proceed in the future but in the end finally it has produced an honest product with honest numbers i think it makes a significant advance forward in meeting the needs that it is supposed to meet i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00019150972366333008, 0.9998084902763367, 1, "i thank my colleague for requesting this hour this evening i very much appreciate the opportunity to participate i will assure the speaker i do not intend to take the full remaining part of the time tonight if some other colleagues do show up i will yield to them under the rule let me sort of begin where the gentleman from washington just ended and on the chart that he has in the well and point out contrary to a lot of rhetoric in this body over the last few days there is no budget surplus this year when we look at the year 2000 the offbudget surplus is 5 billion projected in the year 2001 it is 24 billion projected therefore i would hope that this body would resist the temptation that is prevalent today to talk in terms of an 850 billion tax cut over the next 10 years when according to all arithmetic today that is conservative you will find that it will have to be done with borrowed money now the people that i represent do not get excited about a tax cut that is paid for with borrowed money the first thing they assume is that if you borrow 850 billion the least you are going to pay for interest is about 5 percent maybe 6 percent because it is the government doing the borrowing but then they understand that if that is done with borrowed money there is a pretty good chance that the federal reserve is going to involve itself in our decisions i ask my colleagues tonight what did the federal reserve do a couple of weeks ago if memory serves me correctly they increased interest rates by 25 percent why did the federal reserve and the wisdom of alan greenspan increase those interest rates because they were afraid the economy was about to start overheating inflation was going to begin moving up and they wanted to nip it in the bud now let us move ourselves back to the subject of tax cutting why would we want a tax cut obviously because it is a politically popular thing to do it makes good political rhetoric to say we are going to leave this money that has been accumulated by overtaxing the people and sending it back to you but by the same breath tax cuts stimulate the economy now the problem that i have with this 850 billion tax cut is that if on the one hand we are going to stimulate the economy and that stimulation of the economy is going to cause interest rates to go up who is going to benefit best i would submit to you tonight the best tax cut that this congress can give to all of the american people is to act fiscally responsible and to make certain that interest rates do not go up in fact can come back down that is something we had better think about because we are not in control of the federal reserve and it is predictable based on what chairman greenspan has been saying what will happen if in fact the economy starts to overheat but i go back to my first comment and point out again there is no budget surplus now i have a little further problem with this chart and all of these guesstimations because that is what they are i have been around here a few years and i remember the debate in this body not too many years ago in which we argued for hour after hour as to whether or not we could project 2 years 3 years now all of a sudden we are accepting 15year projections now who among us can predict tomorrow much less 15 years from today who among us can make these kind of decisions and that is why the blue dogs as we are affectionately called by some in the budget proposal that we made earlier this year suggested let us stop this business yes mr president you and to the leadership of this body let us stop this business of taking 15year numbers and acting like this 700 billion is going to occur and let us go back to 5year numbers let us be conservative let us use 5year numbers and let us not get carried away either with our desire for cutting taxes or our desire on the part of some for spending more money now again let me repeat there is no budget surplus most of these surpluses are dealing with social security when you look at the offbudget or the onbudget surplus you do have projected over the next 5 years 231 billion what is it about this that should bother us when we take a 231 billion projected surplus over the next 5 years and suddenly use that as justification to have an 850 billion tax cut and what ought to really bother this body is that when you look at that other number on this chart and you look at that 2414 number that is when we have major problems dealing with social security that is why another part of the blue dog budget has said let us devote 100 percent of the social security trust funds to solving the social security problem and let us do this by paying down the debt let us pay down the debt with all of the social security trust funds and we go further in saying let us take half of the nonsocial security surplus funds and pay down the debt with them and then let us use the other half of that projected surplus to deal with the concept of tax cuts and the concept of increased funding particularly for defense we find over the weekend the pentagon began to raise concerns and rightfully they did because when anyone looks at an 850 billion tax cut over the next 10 years and then sees how it literally explodes about 2014 that becomes a problem for the military it becomes a problem for our veterans programs it becomes a problem for medicare and medicaid but it even more seriously becomes a major problem for social security in 2014 because that is the year in which the social security trust funds begin not to or the amount of taxes we are all paying on social security begin not to cover the expected outgo of 2014 in other words the current situation we have in which social security is bringing in more than we are paying out begins to turn the other way as the baby boom generation begins to retire it ought to bother us and it ought to say to this body and to those as we speak who are marking up this tax bill in extreme haste tonight now is the time for us not to be liberal with our thinking but to be conservative with our thinking and to realize that these are projections and no one responsibly spends projections like it is real money let me give my colleagues a few numbers in backing up there is no budget surplus this year for the first 8 months of fiscal year 1999 october through may the treasury reported a cumulative surplus of 40 7 billion but it is composed of an offbudget surplus of 78 8 billion minus an onbudget surplus of 38 1 there is no surplus and yet we keep talking like there is one let me read an editorial that was printed in todays san angelo standard times this is the way it went washingtons budget discussions annoying it is surreal to listen to washington politicians arguing about how they ought to spend tax cuts on new programs a projected budget surplus of 5 9 trillion over the next 15 years there are two niggling problems with such talk one is that it is the wrong policy the second is that not only is the amount of money being discussed little better than a blind guess there is not even any assurance that there will be any surplus consider that the new projections are 1 trillion higher than the one made just this past february then consider that just 10 months ago the projected surplus was about onethird the numbers being tossed around now and finally consider that just 18 months ago we were still talking about deficits can anyone really have enough confidence in such inexact calculations to make any plans that rely on their accuracy is it not obvious that if economic conditions can improve so rapidly they can worsen just as rapidly in fr ct would not the smart money say that after 98 months of economic expansion the longest during the peacetime in the nations history a downturn is vastly more likely than 15 more years of uninterrupted growth and that future plans ought to reflect that probability the only good thing about the current budget blabbering is that the 5 9 trillion figure is in the ball park of the amount owed on the national debt would it not be nice if that image paying off the debt and not dollar signs begging to be given this political barter was the one that filled the politicians heads would it not be nice if the trillions of dollars that have been and will be paid in interest on the debt could be used in some more productive way making the current talk even more frustrating is that doing the right thing is not even a difficult political choice polls have consistently shown that given the options americans want congress and the president to get jbl 13 1999 the nations fiscal house in order before doing anything else with extra money maybe the glorious projections being tossed around will turn out to be right or maybe the surplus will wind up being even twice as large three times as large that would be splendid but it is foolish and irresponsible to base policy on dreams and wishes washington should take care of the priorities first the money owed and the money that will be owed to future social security and medicare recipients before committing any budget surplus elsewhere i could not have said it better myself and as we go into tomorrows continued markup in the committee on ways and means and then next week having an 850 billion tax cut on the floor many of us are going to be reminding this body time and time again if you really mean it when you say let us lock up the social security trust funds and not use them if you really mean it when we talk about saving social security medicare and medicaid if you really mean it that we are going to keep our nations fiscal house in order we must not succumb to the temptation to spend this surplus that may or may not even be realized for any purpose and that includes the cutting of taxes because if we make that mistake let us remember what happened the last time when we were not able to meet the spending needs in the 1980s we borrowed 3 trillion almost 4 trillion we borrowed because we could not and would not make the difficult decisions right here in this body again my plea to the leadership of this house let us make the tough decisions first let us settle the appropriations battle let us acknowledge that if in fact we do have a need to build up our nations military and we do that there is no way on this earth we will be able to meet those numbers unless we deal with them responsibly in the budget by making that decision fifst let us acknowledge all of us that if you are concerned about social security you cannot wink at 2014 you cannot say we are going to pass that on to the future congresses we do not care about what is going to happen then oh we care but we have got a plan and the plan is yet to be materialized why would it not be the most responsible thing for us to have a social security bill on the floor why would it not be the most responsible to have a bill for medicare reform on the floor and have honest to goodness projections why do we have our hospitals in town this week again concerned as my hospitals are here as i met with them hospital administrators from about 20 in my district who are concerned about having to shut down because the budget decisions that were made in the 1997 balanced budget agreement went too far and as i point out to them it did not go near as far as some folks in this body would have liked to have seen but why not have an open and honest debate about how we are going to deal with health care first why do we postpone that until after we have a vote on spending the entire surplus that may or may not be a real one these are some of the questions that i think we are going to have to ask and to answer over and over and over again remember when anyone talks about an 852 billion surplus that is not social security remember the highway bill that this body passed last year overwhelmingly look at the money that we voted to spend there that busted the hound out of the caps but nobody saying oh we were not busting them because that was just part of the highway bill look at this year when we passed an airport bill not too many days ago and folks were standing up on the committee on the budget and saying we are busting the caps no we are not because the total has not been busted yet but that old bucket is filling up and as it fills up we are going to have some extremely interesting times and i do not want i hope to be part of another congress that for political reasons absolutely and totally disregards the future of our children and grandchildren that is what we will do if we choose to have a tax cut for selfgratification today we will be saying to our children and grandchildren we do not give a rip about you because the urgency is what the polls that we have to be looking at this year and that is somebody somewhere is saying we need a tax cut i agree we need a tax cut but not with borrowed money that is the significant thing that we are going to have to somehow get over hopefully to a majority of this body that it does not make economic sense for us to waste this opportunity of fiscal responsibility the first time in many many years that we have got 2 years in a row in which when you take social security trust funds and offbudget onbudget all of this malarkey that we talk about here that we do have a surplus if we apply it to the debt and honestly use this opportunity to deal with the longterm problems of social security we can do something that our grandchildren will look back on and i happen to have two i should say my wife cindy and i happen to have two and i have resolved and many people asked me why i have been so involved as i have in the social security question i am not on the committee on ways and means i have been working with the gentleman from arizona my colleague we have bipartisan support now for a proposal on social security that does what we say it will do and people say well what do we say it will do it goes a long way towards solving the longterm problems of social security better than any other proposal out there and people say well charlie why are you so involved in social security i and i say two reasons their names are chase and cole it is mine and my wifes 4yearold and 2yearold grandsons i do not want them to look back 65 years from today and say if only my granddad would have done what in his heart he knew he should have done when he was in the congress we would not be in the mess we are in today we have a wonderful opportunity if we can find the bipartisan political courage to deal conservatively with this surplus to avoid the temptation that some have today to spend the money whether it be on tax cuts or whether it be on spending for new programs members will see me up at this mike and at other mikes and using every possible opportunity over the next several days to encourage a majority of my colleagues to take this surplus and pay down the debt listen to what the american people are telling us in district after district they are saying pay down the debt any small business man or woman knows what happens to their business when they get more debt than they can pay back when the interest cost becomes insurmountable an insurmountable problem to them they understand why is it so difficult for members of congress to understand that is the message the blue dogs will be bringing that is the message i hope we will find bipartisan support for"], [0.00019174814224243164,

think once we get through some of the rhetoric and hyperbole we might get down to some of the facts i think their arguments would seem to steal defeat from the jaws of victory in terms of this is a procra bill it expands cra it does so i think in a way and that was an absolutely fundamental demand by the president i respect the fact that the gentleman from iowa chairman leach and the ranking member fought like lionesses over their cubs trying to protect this and recognizing the necessity of doing it this was the last thing that we dealt with it was tough we have disclosure in here there are provisions with regard to reporting which i think are onerous but they are workable and we expand cra thousands of applications and thousands of other activities that went on that did not need cra will and every part and every branch of that holding company will have to have a positive cra rating in order to accomplish it in this bill we put teeth back in the fair credit reporting act which had been extracted several years ago that is an important consumer gain we have the prime act in here that the gentleman from illinois and senator kennedy sponsored which is so important to our local communities there are a lot of good things in this bill the activity of the gentlewoman from colorado with regards to spousal abuse is in this particular bill but beyond that of course the privacy issue is the most interesting issue of all because many have raised this great facade but 2 years ago when a bill was up here and some of the advocates to it would have allowed us with regards to being against this bill because it does not have enough privacy protections in this found it in their wisdom and hearts to vote for a bill that had none in it in minnesota we talk about protecting that one bank because they trespassed or were thought to have trespassed had to of course deal with a cra agreement or with regards to a privacy agreement i am concerned about that one bank but i was concerned about the other 549 banks in minnesota that did not have any law that would govern their particular privacy this covers all the banks in the nation and all the insurance firms in the nation and all the security firms in the nation and all the entities that are financial in nature are covered under this particular bill in terms of a privacy policy now even though it has taken 6 years to pass this guess what next year we are going to have to do some more work i hope that my colleagues realize we have not worked ourselves quite out of a job here yet we may have some imperfections in this legislation as there is in others and i will gladly confess that to my colleagues that we are going to have to come back and do additional work in this particular area but we have a solid foundation the principal provisions of this bill which have recognized the rusting and weakened and rotten chains of glasssteagall are finally recognized and congress is getting out in front and rationalizing and putting a policy in place in which our financial foundation a dysfunctional system can work that is what this is really all about i think in the process of doing so we have advanced and improved consumer provisions in this bill we should be proud to vote for it and proud towork for the results not simply polarization that this congress i think too often has reflected this year let us do something positive let us vote for this bill i rise in support of this conference report this agreement reached in a difficult and wrangling 66 member conference between the two bodies with very different products is a historic bill the conference report on s 900 is a balance it is a balance between the housepassed bill and the senatepassed bill it is a balance between competing industries it is a balance between bigger banks and smaller banks it is a balance between business and consumer needs it is a bill that does not allow us to continue to stick our heads in the sand with regard to the state of the financial services industry and instead brings the law up to date i worked upon and signed this conference report on s 900 the financial services modernization act in an effort to pave a path for the future that will provide financial opportunities for american consumers and communities across this country and that will keep our financial services sector competitive in the world economy we have a new law that will remove the rusted chains of glasssteagall and that will help insure that consumers receive quality financial services and new protections the measure removes the barriers preventing affiliation between banks insurance and securities entities and provides financial services firms the choice of conducting certain financial activities in bank holding company affiliates or in subsidiaries of bank structures on a safe and sound basis the agreement will not undermine the national bank charter vis a vis state banks foreign banks or the activities of unitedstates banks that have subsidiaries abroad with relative powers the conference agreement brought resolution to the differences over traditional bank securities powers we have successfully shut down the commercial loophole by prohibiting the sale of unitary thrifts to commercial entities functional regulation has been established on matter from insurance sales to antitrust anticoncentration law enforcement importantly the bill enhances the viability of smaller community banks and financial entities vital to extending services and credit through our greater economy rural and urban we do not have complete parity for affiliation between banks and insurance and securities firms with regard to commercial activities because of the 15 year grandfather provisions we could have merged the bank and thrift charters and merged the two deposit insurance funds that remain separate in law today i would have also hoped that we could have included fair housing compliance on insurance affiliates lowcost banking accounts and application of community reinvestment actlike requirements on products that are similar to bank products such as mortgages there are however no perfect bills produced through the congressional process with 535 views in the mix with the administrations phalanx of regulators and policy works the focus of the lengthy and public debate over this legislation has been the opening of the financial services marketplace to new competition and the reduction of barriers between financial services providers it is equally important that this bill is a positive step for our constituents and the communities in which they live as well in general there are inherent benefits of being able to provide streamlined onestop shopping with comprehensive services choices for consumers according to the treasury department financial services modernization could mean as much as 15 billion annually in savings to consumers hopefully some of these dollars will materialize we also have achieved other policy victories for consumers across the country we have modernized the community reinvestment act cra in a positive manner the cra was enacted by congress in 1977 to combat discrimination the cra encourages federallyinsured financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities by providing credit and deposit services in the communities they serve on a safe and sound basisa basic reaffirmation of the purpose of insured depository institutions according to the national community reinvestment coalition the law has helped bring more than 1 trillion in commitments to these communities since its enactment across this great nation organizations belonging to ncrc acorn lisc enterprise neighborhood housing services and others have engaged cra to work with their local financial institutions to make their communities better places to live importantly the conference agreement will continue to ensure that cra will remain essential and relevant in a changing financial marketplace it is not everything i wanted or supported during the several amendments process it does however further the goals of the community reinvestment act by requiring that all of a holding companys subsidiary depository institutions have at least a satisfactory cra rating in order to affiliate as a financial holding company or to engage in any of the new financial activities authorized under this act this strengthens and modernizes the reel of cra in that current law does not have a cra satisfactory requirement for nonbank activities in which banks now seek to engage the federal reserve board has informed us that thousands of applications have been approved without any cra test that this bill will apply further according to the treasury department if a bank were to proceed without having a satisfactory cra the regulators have strong enforcement authority including monetary penalties cease and desist and divesture that they could apply the conference rightly rejected the other bodys proposed small bank exemption and safe harbor provisions for cra we did accept however a modified disclosure and reporting system i strongly disagreed with the burdensome socalled sunshine and reporting provisions in the senate bill they certainly raise the specter of harassment of procra groups however very few would oppose openness and public disclosure certainly the disclosure of information could spell out the effectiveness of these groups working so hard in our communities and the effectiveness of the cra itself i believe the reporting requirements although improved remain an extraordinarily difficult policy as structured in this measure it no doubt will be more of a burden to community groups and banks who currently do not file such status reports however we were able to streamline the reporting requirements and to limit who should file a report even as we gave the regulators substantial authority to properly oversee such provisions we should be mindful of the administrations and regulators expressions of good will to take a common sense approach with regards to its implementation hopefully they will help make these disclosure and reporting requirements more workable congress certainly must closely monitor the implementation of these provisions and their effects the conference report also contains two studies one evaluating business lines associated with cra and another looking at the impact of the changes or impact of this law on cra i am concerned about the short turnaround time of the report required of the federal reserve board i would hope that this important study of the default and profitability of cra loans will not be rushed to the point of not doing an adequate or fair job solely to meet an arbitrary deadline further this study should be inclusive and identify all loans individual commercial or other or activities that would qualify or be given as credit to financial institutions for craand certainly not just to those loads or actions that qualify under the cra reporting provisions of section 711 of the act other positive consumer provisions include the requirement that institutions ensure that consumers are not confused about new financial products along with strong antitying and anticoercion provisions governing the marketing of financial products a new program to provide technical assistance to low income microentrepreneurs known as the prime act will be created with enactment of this conference report atm fees will have to be fully disclosed to consumers not only on the computer screen but also on the atm machine itself i am disappointed that the conference committee rejected provisions i initiated which encouraged public meetings in the case of megamergers between banks which both have more than 1 billion in assets where there may be a substantial public impact because of the larger merger this would have provided our constituents with the important opportunity to express their views regarding mega mergers and their impact in our communities as my colleagues are aware this conference report contains landmark financial privacy protections for consumers today there is no federal law to protect your privacy or to stop the sale or sharing of your financial records with third party companies as many in my home state of minnesota learned this year not even credit card numbers are safe from telemarketers unless we act in the conference report to put in place substantive law with enactment of this agreement congress will give consumers real choices to protect their financial privacy this conference report will provide some of the strongest privacy provisions to ever be enacted into any federal law this agreement based upon the strong house provisions that i helped draft has an affirmative mandate upon all financial entities whether federal or state so that all banks brokers insurance companies credit unions credit card companies and many others must protect your personal financial information furthermore consumers will have an important choice of optingout of most information sharing with unaffiliated third parties financial institutions will no longer be able to share your customer account numbers or access codes with unaffiliated third parties for the purpose of telemarketing when you open an account and each year thereafter you will receive a full disclosure of the privacy policies of your bank credit union securities firm mutual funds or insurance companies if the policy is not strong enough this gives you the choice to choose a new company or to communicate your concerns to that financial enterprise importantly this conference agreement provides that financial institutions have an affirmative responsibility to protect and respect your financial privacy federal regulators are given the authority to set standards which guide the regulated and which will protect the security and confidentiality of a customers personal information we were successful in improving upon the house provisions by agreeing to allow states to give even more privacy protection to consumers at their discretion stronger state laws will not be preempted by this federal law the agreement also strengthens the fair credit reborting act giving bank regulators the ability to detect and enforce any violations of credit reporting and consumer privacy reestablishing regulatory provisions and the related enforcement powers essential to the same for the purposes like servicing accounts ordering checks selling loans to the secondary market giving consumers frequent flyer miles and complying with federal laws the agreement sets out exceptions in crafting regulations to implement this law the regulators should do nothing to further any sharing of account numbers or encrypted access codes which is not expressly conveyed through optin permission from consumers prior to any activity that would share such numbers further the regulators should not make any exemptions that would make it possible for consumers to opt in over the phone to a telemarketer regarding the sharing of their account number condoning such a practice would simply reaffirm the status quo with regard to those bad actors who would take advantage of the practice and avoid the clear intent of the law as the regulators begin to shape appropriate exceptions in regulation i entreat them to look carefully at the statute and to the clear intent to limit exceptions sharing with third parties outside of the scope of these limited exceptions should not be allowed the legislation does attempt to provide some competitive equality to smaller institutions vis a vis larger affiliated structures without providing loopholes which would invade consumers financial privacy the regulators should not provide exceptions merely to make something easier for financial institutions when it comes at the expense of the knowledge and benefit of consumers some have suggested that these major new privacy protections be jettisoned because they do not go far enough rejection would make these unprecedented good privacy protections the enemy of a skewed version of what is best to reverse the major strides made by this legislation is to steal defeat from the jaws of victory if congress says no to these new privacy provisions the result would be business as usual tacitly agreeing to sell your credit card numbers to telemarketers and permitting your financial data to float around the open market like the latest trade item on ebay would be a set back for privacy what is clear is that a law that requires consumer action is appropriate but third party and affiliate optout is hardly the first and last word in consumer rights we can do more and can do better the fact is that a number of consumers have such a right of optout today under fair credit reporting act or through voluntary institution policies even with that opportunity in law and practice only a small fraction of individuals less than 1 percent exercise that option consumer choice may give us a positive feeling of control and remedy but what does it really accomplishwhat is the bottom line does it provide results if only a fraction of 1 respond to the celebrated optout i do want to note something on the medical privacy provisions that were deleted from the housepassed bill h r 10 in this conference report mindful of the deep concerns raised by our colleagues on the commerce committee and many other outside the congress we finally deleted these admittedly less than perfect provisions in the bill in lieu of improving them the house approved a cqnvoluted motion to instruct the conferees to do as much i had and still have concerns about the leap of faith that this action deleting the provisionsrequired i hope that we will not be disappointed a i note the recriminations that have already been voiced by some i am pleased that the president has recently proposed comprehensive privacy provisions as a result of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa law and hope that they will provide the protection we sought to assure and that there are no loopholes for medical privacy with regard to financial institutions consumers should not be forced to disclose and make public private medical data just to get insurance coverage although this legislation creates a new affiliated bank holding company structure that allows insurance banking and securities firms to join that must not translate into misuse and abuse of medical records by insurance companies and affiliates no one should be able to share private medical or genetic information to base credit upon or for other unrelated purposes we have been in the trenches on this bill for the last five years following more than 20 years of debate on financial modernization we are at the goal line i again want to express my appreciation to chairman leach ranking member lafalce chairwoman roukema our counterparts in the senate and all the respective staff especially my personal staff larry j romans kirsten johnsonobey and ern sermeus for their outstanding work cooperation and patience on this important legislation we worked hard together to create a bipartisan product that has gained the support of the administration and that overcame the polarized senatepassed measure the financial services modemization act of 1999 is a tremendous achievement if bittersweet from some reasons mentioned it is a solid foundation to build our economy upon as we move into the next century i urge my colleagues to support the conference report"], [0.00019282102584838867, 0.9998071789741516, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume first of all the gentleman from florida the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations is correct the president will sign this third continuing resolution he should not have to i would have hoped that we would have been done by now but we all i think understand why my problem is that right after this continuing resolution we are going to be dealing with about a 3hour charade i need to discuss that in the context of this continuing resolution after this continuing resolution is disposed of we will be bringing to the house floor a socalled conference report on the labor health education appropriation bill the problem is that that conference took place on a bill that never even saw the light of day on the floor of this house and under the rules of the congress we are not supposed to have a conference until both houses have been able to vote on the bill now the bill that comes out is an important bill the problem with that bill is not really in the end the funding level we could resolve our remaining dollar differences in that bill in about 3 hours if we are given the opportunity to do so but the problem is that the debate on this bill and the bill to follow today will in my view symbolize how political debate in this house has been trivialized and used to obscure rather than reveal the truth next year we enter a new century we enter a new millennium we were sent here to make certain that we make the big decisions that will preserve the security of our country and strengthen the prosperity of our country for the next decade and for the next generation instead we will be treated to a 3hour cheap phony manipulated debate about social security now how did this all happen in january the president stood right here behind me and he asked the congress to pass legislation that would extend the solvency of social security for todays generation and tomorrows he asked us to strengthen medicare and provide coverage for prescription drugs under medicare he asked us to pass a budget that would help communities to rebuild fallingdown schools reduce class size by providing 100 000 new teachers equip every school with modern technology he asked us to protect the environment he asked us to help him provide more police on our streets this bill the last appropriations bill for the year that will shortly follow does none of those things instead of listening to what the president asked for instead of trying to resolve those problems our majority friends our republican friends on the other side of the aisle spent the last 8 months trying to pass a tax cut package which gave 70 percent of the benefits to the wealthiest 5 percent of people in this country making above 100 000 a year that tax package ate up virtually every dollar in sight that could have been used to strengthen social security and to strengthen medicare in fact our republican friends at one point were willing to cut virtually every program in the labor health and education bill by almost 30 percent in order to make that tax package happen now after it did not sell and after our friends on the republican side have seen their numbers drop in the polls we now have a very troubling situation they have passed through this house a series of appropriation bills four appropriation bills which spend almost 30 billion more than the president asked us to spend the chairman of the committee himself said that the defense bill alone was 16 billion above what the president had asked for but now after that has been done we now have our republican friends saying oh guess what folks we cannot fund the presidents education and health and crime fighting and environmental priorities without spending the social security surplus there are three problems with that to be blunt about it the first is that it is a phony issue not one dollar in the presidents request or in any bill that we support on this side of the aisle will reduce the balance in the social security trust fund by one dollar second it is a joke for our republican friends to cry crocodile tears about protecting social security this is the party that tried to kill social security when it was born they have tried to turn it over to the insurance companies for 30 years and privatize it they have been willing to put an unaffordable tax cut ahead of fixing up social security and medicare and this is a party which is led by their leader who said that social security should be phased out and that in a free society there should be no room for a program like medicare for us to believe that a party with that track record suddenly stands as the only hope for social security recipients is to make jay leno look bad the third problem with the argument is that our republican friends despite their assertions to the contrary have already spent billions of dollars out of the social security trust fund to pay for other things this year at one point they had spent up to 27 billion out of that social security trust fund to hide that fact what did they do first they simply adopted a budget technique which hid 18 billion so it could not be counted that still left them with a 9 billion hole and so what have they done in the bill that they are bringing to the floor today they did not take out all the pork that was put in appropriation bills they did not take out the famous billion dollar ship that was nailed into the defense bill by the majority leader in the other body no they did not do that they did not take out any of the hundreds of projects that were put in those bills instead they pretend that they are imposing a harmless 1 percent acrosstheboard cut in programs well what does that harmless 1 percent do well for one thing it cripples the social security administratio n because it forces them to cut back on the number of people that we use to ferret out fraudulent claims in social security and medicare and people who also try to get legitimate checks cut to the people who legitimately deserve those programs they are cutting millions of dollars out of veterans health care under their proposal and they are in the process also creating a colossal disruption of medical research they are virtually shutting down all new grants to scientists in this country who go to the national institutes of health to get funding to do research on cancer heart disease alzheimers lou gehrigs dis ease you name it what they do is they pretend that they are going to give them a couple of billion dollars more money but then they say that they cannot spend it for an entire year and they do it all for budgetary reasons well i want to say make no mistake about it this is not just a budgetary gimmick there will be people who will die because of that delayed medical research anybody who understands how the research programs in this country work understands that and all of this is to pretend that they have not spent any of the social security surplus that whole issue is a false issue to begin with for a generation this congress has taken surpluses in the social security account it has put federal notes in that social security account and it has used that money for other purposes and now next year what do we face instead of having 100 percent of that money being used for other purposes as it was for 30 years what we have instead under a worstcase scenario is that 80 percent of that money instead is going to be used to pay down the national debt only the folks running this house could turn that kind of major progress into a political crisis they ought to be ashamed of themselves for doing that the fact is if they really want to strengthen social security they will quit playing games with it and what they will do is recognize that the best thing they can do along with paying down debt the best thing that they can do is make the kind of investments we need in generation x for their education and for their job training so we can raise the income that they will earn so they will have decent salaries and can pay more into social security in order to extend the strength and the life of that social security fund that is what we would say if this issue was being dealt with honestly on the floor but it is letspretend time and so we cannot get to the truth i guess so what i guess i would say to my majority friends on the republican side of the aisle is simply this if they have the votes pass this turkey get it on to the president let him veto it let us clear the air and then let us really sit down and do business if we could get the political bull gravy out of this debate we could solve all of the remaining dollar problems in about 3 days we are not that far apart the gap in dollars that separate us is not nearly as large as the credibility gap that they have developed in the way that the majority has handled this issue there are only four ways to get a budget the first is if they really want to protect social security we can go back and we can cut out a lot of the excess spending that they have included in some of the previously passed appropriation bills if they want to do that i will work with them on that if they do not want to do that i am not going to argue second thing they could do then is simply say okay we are going to take a look at some of the presidents revenue sources such as his proposal to try to discourage the use of tobacco by young people which would bring some additional revenue into the treasury i do not much like that but i would rather support that than to lie and that is what is happening now the third thing they can do if they want to pass a budget is simply get real and to simply adjust the spending caps which we are operating under to reflect what we are actually spending rather than what we pretend we are spending i know the gentleman from florida has urged the same solution i agree with him on that they can get my support on any of those three options the one option i do not want to support is the one that the house continues to pursue at this moment which is to stay in letspretend land and to hide everything that we are doing through all of these fancy budgetary devices this chart shows what they are doing to the national institutes of health the blue graph shows what amount of money was provided by the national institutes of health to medical researchers in each month last year as those contracts were signed in an orderly fashion under this bill that they are bringing to the floor today they are telling the national institutes of health that even though they ate going to give them more money they are not going to let them spend it for an entire year and then in the last 2 days they are supposed to put out a huge percentage of their own budget that is irresponsible it is a financial gimmick it does not serve any purpose but to cover somebodys political tail and it will hurt our efforts to find cures for every major disease that plagues mankind so i would say simply there are a lot of good people on both sides of the aisle and sooner or later they have to be unleashed so that we can sit down work out a rational compromise on these bills and get this congress out of town before it does any more damage to its reputation i reserve the balance of my time"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5485575497150421,

resolution it was the first time in the 26year history of the budget act that congress failed to adopt a budget it disrupted the appropriations process and made it much more difficult for the entire house to complete any of its legislative business in an orderly way then again last year we adopted a budget but it was an unrealistic budget it was shot full of holes with gimmicks and blue smoke and mirrors it treated things like the decennial census that has been going on since 1790 as an emergency we did not complete action on the appropriations bills until well after the fiscal year had begun we failed the american people again now again this budget resolution is equally unrealistic it is so filled with assumptions that we know will not be met that it is not fair to the american people to even propose it never mind pass it on the floor of the house we know it is not a real budget we know that what this is is not serious legislation but political expediency we would probably be better off doing what we did in 1998 without a budget resolution whether it be the republican leadership budget or the cats budget which are not all that substantively different these republican budgets start with the wholly unrealistic assumption that we will be able to hold nondefense discretionary outlays to 114 billion below inflation over the next 5 years that is not going to happen next year alone as the gentleman from south carolina suggested we will have to cut nearly 20 billion below the level needed just to keep level with inflation yet we know that the congress has increased nondefense appropriations faster than inflation every year since 1996 who are we kidding if we were honest with the american people we would admit that we have no intention of cutting federal law enforcement or education or environmental programs or veterans care you name it we are not going to cut it we are going to do what our constituents demand that we do and at least keep these programs

hiding it shifting it from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2000 maybe that will be this years gimmick but it is not right to the american people to be deceiving them in this way the main problem is that to accommodate a tax cut in the range of 200 billion whether it be the republican leadership budget or the cats budget we know that we are putting in place a situation where we are going to be cutting revenue by almost 1 trillion over 10 years those tax cuts are not fair they are not fair to the american people but most importantly they are not fair to our children we have an opportunity today to pay off the debt that we incurred in the 1980s to pay down that debt to eliminate that debt by the year 2013 as well as the quarter of a trillion dollars in interest we have to pay every year on that debt if we do not our children have to pay off that debt what could be more immoral than to pass that debt on to our children what could be worse than to say to our children that they are

cannot read tax law because this bill is not designed for small business people twothirds of the 120 billion in tax breaks goes for the estate tax that affects the 2 percent richest people at the top of the society that is why this graph is so illustrative the republican tax bill is all loaded on the end of the rich people the gentleman from new york has put a bill forward that says yes we believe there ought to be some estate tax changes but like this blue line it ought to start way back with small peoples estates and sort of be equal all the way not the republicans give it all to the rich

solution to the problem which existed the compromise which was entirely bipartisan allows some lowpower stations to be licensed under existing interference standards immediately some 70 and it then requires the fcc to establish a pilot program in a limited number of markets to determine precisely what the effects would be if these interference standards are relaxed in the future this is to protect broadcasters it is to protect licensees and it is above all else to protect the listeners of the fm radio spectrum by moving this theoretical question from the laboratory to the real world all of us will be better able to judge whether or not permanent service as envisioned by the fcc should be permitted to move forward it should be noted that the fcc has here moved without any consideration of fact and without any careful scientific work they have no understanding of whether or not or how much interference will be caused by the order which they have brought forward great outrage existed throughout both the listener community and also through the broadcasting community we are trying to see to it that a diversity of voices and views will be available to the american people including a new lowpower service this i believe is beneficial we do not debate the question of whether lowpower service would be beneficial to our communities i happen to believe so i have not heard any of my colleagues on either side of the aisle to dispute the value of adding more diversity to the airwaves furthermore i would note that neither the national association of broadcasters nor national public radio both of whom are proponents of this legislation have taken issue with the underlying goal of the fccs recent order but i would note that the legislation as amended does allow the project envisioned by the fcc to go forward under careful controls and under good understanding of the basic underlying scientific questions which have to be addressed the issue under debate here is simply whether the fccs order would cause an unacceptable level interference and thereby disenfranchise large numbers of existing radio stations and more importantly their listeners because it is the listeners that we protect put simply we want to make sure that the fcc has done its homework and that it will do its homework and that no harmful interference will result from these new stations the result i think is one that is in the public interest in any event the bill as originally introduced by my friend the gentleman from ohio simply would have repealed the fccs order that i believe was unwise many members of the committee on commerce including myself were not convinced that that was a proper solution so we have come forward with a compromise which allows the matter to go forward and

protection legislation to correct hmo abuses we passed the norwooddingellganske bipartisan consensus managed care reform act of 1999 with a vote of 275 to so members ask why is that bill not law yet why is not the congressional leadership leaning on the chairman of the conference committee to hold meetings is the conference dead if so then senator nickles should say so so that we can move beyond the failure of the conferences committee every day that goes by without passage into law of a real patient protection bill means that people are being harmed by hmos that care more about their bottom line more about their most recent stock quotes on wall street than they care about patients let me give some examples of people who have been harmed by hmos before coming to congress i was a reconstructive surgeon i took care of little children that were born with birth defects like this little baby with a cleft lip and palate do my colleagues know that in the last several years more than 50 percent of the surgeon who care for children born with this birth defect have had cases like these refused by hmos who call this a cosmetic deformity this is a birth defect the operation to repair this would be to restore towards normalcy that is not a cosmetic case under any definition a couple of years ago now this ladys case was profiled on the cover of time magazine this woman lived in california her hmodid not tell her all that she needed to know furthermore they put pressure on the medicare center treating her not to tell her because she did not get that information in a timely fashion and because her hmo did not play straight with her on getting her the treatment that she needed as medically necessary she died today her children and her husband do not have a mother and a wife a couple of years ago a young woman was hiking in the mountains about 70 miles west of washington d c she fell off a 40foot cliff she broke her pelvis fractured her arm broke her skull was lying at the bottom of this 40foot cliff when her boyfriend who had a cellular phone managed to get a helicopter in they took her to the emergency room she was treated she lived but then do members know what the hmo would not pay her bill because she had not phoned ahead for prior authorization was she supposed to have a crystal ball that was going to tell her that she was going to fall off a 40foot cliff so she could make a phone call to her hmo i have shared these stories with my colleagues in the past but i have some new ones tonight that are going to amaze my colleagues this is also a story a true story about a little boy we can see him here tagging on his sisters sleeve one night his temperature was about 104 or 105 degrees and his mother phoned the 1800 number for their hmo and said my baby needs to go to the emergency room he is really sick she got somebody thousands of miles away who said well i will only authorize you to take him to one emergency room and when the mother asked where it was the person said i do not know find a map it turned out that the hmo was about 60 or 70 miles away en route this little baby had a cardiac arrest if one is a mom and dad driving this little baby to the hospital members can imagine what that was like when they finally found it the mother leaped out of the car holding her little baby screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse came out started resuscitation they put in the i v lines gave him mouthtomouth resuscitation gave him the medicines and they managed to bring his life back all because that hmo did not have the common sense or decency to say if your baby isreally sick take him to the nearest emergency room because en route they passed three emergency rooms but they were not authorized by that hmo this little baby managed to survive but because he had that cardiac arrest he lost the circulation to his hands and his feet and he had to have both hands and both feet amputated why do 80 percentplus of the american public think that congress should pass an hmo reform bill a patient protection bill a real bill because their friends and neighbors have had problems just like some of those that i have shown the members a few years ago there was a movie as good as it gets in that movie helen hunt is talking to her friend jack nicholson and explaining how this hmo that they belong to will not properly take care of her son who has asthma then she let loose a string of expletives that i cannot repeat on the floor of congress but i can tell the members what happened in the theater that my wife and i were in it happened all across the country people started cheering and clapping and even standing up in applause because they knew the truth of that allegation no law has passed because the hmos have spent over 100 million lobbying against real patient protection legislation they have given generously to keepthat legislation bottled up in conference committee even worse the hmo industry is trying to get legislation passed that would undo the progress that is being made on behalf of patients in state legislatures and in the courts the gop bill that recently passed the senate the nickles amendment is worse than no bill at all in fact it is an hmo protection bill not a patient protection bill would members like some proof of this let me tell the members about some of the things that have been documented in a recent article in smart money magazine in their july issue l 2000 consider the case of jim ridler it was shortly after noon on a friday back in august 1995 and jim ridler then 35 years old had been out doing some errands he was returning to his home in a small town in minnesota on his motorcycle when a minivan coming from the opposite direction swerved into his lane it hit jim head on it threw him more than 200 feet into a ditch he broke his neck his collar bone his hip severalribs all of the bones in both legs it ripped his triceps muscle clean through over the next 4 months after a dozen surgeries he still did not know whether he would ever walk again when he got a phone call from his lawyer who had started legal proceedings against the driver of that minivan who had swerved into his path that call that he got from his lawyer really shook him up im afraid ive got some bad news for you said his lawyer he told jim that even if jim won his lawsuit his health plan wanted to take a big chunk out of it that they had spent on his care youre joking right said jim nope said the lawyer jims health plan had a clause in its contract that allowed the hmo to stake a claim in his settlement a claim known in insurance as subrogation so i pay the premium and then something happens that i need the insurance for and they want their money back ridler asked incredulously the way i figure it my health insurance is just a loan well ridler eventually settled his lawsuit for 450 000 which was all the liability insurance available his health plan then took 406 000 leaving him after expenses with a grand total of 29 000 i feel like iwas raped by the system he says do my colleagues know what most people are not even aware that these subrogation clauses exist until they have been in an accident and try to recover from a negligent individual like the person who almost killed jim ridler originally subrogation was used for cases in which care was

have been trying to raise the amounts parents are allowed to put into their childrens accounts each year we have been trying to extend education savings accounts so that parents grandparents or other interested parties will be able to use them to prepare for private or parochial elementary or high school expenses if a family vere able to put 2 000 in an education savings accounts every year from the time a child was born and if the account averaged 7 percent interest annually it would hold 14 500 by the time the child got to 1st grade if nothing were withdrawn and annual savings continued that amount would rise to 46 500 when it was time for high school president clinton vetoed an extension of education savings accounts last september but i am confident that most of us in the house think parents should be encouraged to save for their kids futures and that is why we are going to try again"]]}
