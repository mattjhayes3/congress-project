have a responsibility to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands the shooting in orlando was the largest mass shooting in our countrys history this is a moment of truth and we cannot have another moment of silence without some action we are pleading with the speaker of the house and we are pleading with our republican colleagues to allow us to bring two bipartisan bills to the floor for consideration so that we can debate them and vote on them one is the no fly no buy legislation if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane because you are on the terrorist watch list according to the fbi then you are too dangerous to buy a gun it shouldnt be controversial the second is to eliminate the loopholes in our background check system which says that you have to go through a background check if you go to a licensed gun dealer but that you can get around that by going to a gun show or by buying a gun online overwhelming numbers of democrats and republicans according to the latest public opinion polls think both of these ideas are smart commonsense approaches the only thing that is standing in the way is the republican leadership in this house please schedule these bills for a vote no we will not be satisfied with the nra bill that you want to bring to the floor this week that basically is nothing but a press release but will not keep guns out of the hands of people who are suspected of being terrorists i hope that we can reach some sort of accomodation with our republican friends we are not going away this issue is too important and it is about time we acted silence and indifference can no longer be tolerated in this chamber if we defeat the previous question i will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up no fly no buy it is bipartisan legislation that will give

reflected on an unfortunate journey through slavery and segregation prejudices and discrimination though we bring black history month to a close the congressional black caucus will continue to fight for justice tonight our special order hour is bridging the divide observations on race and justice in america our attention to the divides in our society however does not end because we entered a new month we must remain focused on how we can bridge the divides in our society and how we can bring our nation closer together the divides are striking and we know them all too well the school to prison pipeline education disparities health disparities the injustices in our justice system it is well established in fact that students of color face harsher punishments in schools than their white peers leading to a higher number of youth of color in detention suspension and yes expelled african american students are arrested far more often than their white classmates black and hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in schoolrelated arrests or referrals to law enforcement currently african americans make up twofifths and hispanics onefifth of confined youth today disparities are found not only in how we punish behavior in schools but also how we fund education this is true in k12 it is also true in higher education and we know that a college degree is a path to a middle class life as african american students graduate with more debt than their white classmates the cuts to pell grants are threatening african american access to a better education without the pell grant program hundreds of thousands of young african americans would not be able to afford college the disparities in access to health coverage are startling the infant mortality rate among african americans is 2 3 times that of nonhispanic whites and african american infants are four times more likely than nonhispanic white infants to die mostly due to complications related to birth weight we must confront these prejudices and these injustices in our nation headon the congressional black caucus is committed to resolving these challenges the congressional black caucus has fought to ensure funding the pell grant pell grants are contained in each years appropriations bills we have worked hard to make sure that the maternity and newborn care are part of health care plans under the affordable care act over 390 000 african american women in the individual market alone are projected to gain maternity coverage thanksyes thanksto the affordable care act our task force on the elimination of sentencing disparities is moving the ball on how black men and women are treated in the judicial system as we have been working here in congress our partners the deltas my sorority delta sigma theta sorority held their annual delta days in the nations capital today with thousands of women from across this nation gathering and advocating for these same disparities and injustices as deltas were uniting in their efforts today in our nations capital my sorors and i were also uniting for one of our very ownnominee loretta lynch last week the senate judiciary committee voted 128 to approve the confirmation of loretta lynch as the next united states attorney general bringing her confirmation to the full senate for consideration i remember it all too well a couple weeks before that when we were in that hearing room it looked like a sea of red as deltas marched in and lined up one after another wearing our colors crimson and cream deltas lined the outside of the hearing room we did that because prior to entering that room media and some of my colleagues on the other side had tried to make it a bad thing that she organized and was a founder of her college chapter of delta sigma theta sorority what we were able to do was to show them when we work together whether that is democrats and republicans or sorority members or nonsorority members when it is the right thing to do we can make a difference i was so proud last week to sit there on the front row with my other colleagueswith our chairman of the congressional black caucus congressman g k butterfield with the 100th woman sworn into the united states congress congresswoman alma adams to be there with the 21st national president of delta sigma theta sorority congresswoman marcia fudge we sat there next to loretta lynchs father reverend lorenzo lynch of north carolina while the judiciary committee favorably reported the nomination on a vote that was closer than it needed to be ms lynchs nomination is well deserved and historic ms lynch testified before the senate judiciary committee for nearly 8 hours and she responded to nearly 900 written questions which is unprecedented many of the written questions were from senators who had already declared their opposition to her nomination ms lynchs nomination has now been pending far longer than any recent attorney generals nomination which in my opinion is shameful she deserves to be voted our next attorney general if senators have a reason to vote against her nomination they should make their case public yes hiding behind procedural tactics does not help our nation as the senate has an opportunity to unite behind a wellqualified nominee for a critical position congress members will have an opportunity to be united this weekend when democrats and republicans will travel to alabama to march to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the selma marches fifty years ago people marched for equal voting rights out of those marches we got the

this congress will not muster the courage to hold a vote on two proposals that are supported by roughly 90 percent of this country and that can save american lives the american people deserve to be heard they deserve a vote if the unitedstates homeland security community places a person on the fbi terrorist watch list or determines that a person is too dangerous to board an airplane then surely we can agree that person is too dangerous to buy a firearm this week the majority will introduce a bill that pretends to close this gap in our homeland security laws but in reality it would create a system in which it is both legal and likely for suspected terrorists to buy a firearm the republican measure takes no fly no buy and turns it into no fly no problem under their proposal if a known or suspected terrorist attempts to buy a weapon they will be denied that ability for a mere 3 days from the moment they attempt to purchase that firearm the following things must happen all within 72 hours to prevent that purchase the attorney general must file a petition in federal court the court must schedule a hearing the suspect must be provided actual notice and the opportunity to appear at that hearing with a lawyer the court must rule on the petition and if all those things do not occur in 3 days the suspect is legally entitled to buy a weapon not only does the republican bill set an impossible timeline it also requires the justice department to meet an extremely high burden of proof a sale would only be prevented if the court finds probable cause that the suspect has committed or will commit an act of terrorism the republican proposal is specifically designed to ensure the justice department fails and the suspect is allowed to buy a gun it is a fig leaf to cover up the republicans refusal to take any meaningful action on gun violence it is no surprise that this bill is supported by the gun lobby instead of spending our time on toothless ineffective proposals we should vote on the original no fly no buy bill that will keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists we are also demanding a vote on a bipartisan proposal to require that commercial gun purchases include a background check background checks for all i have yet to hear one good explanation on why this should not be the law of the land if a dangerous person cannot pass a background

that sadly isnt being addressed by this congress last week we lost 49 innocent lives in the worst mass shooting that our country has ever seen sadly it is not an insulated case let me give you some numbers in the 3 years since the terrible tragedy at sandy hook elementary school there have been over 1 100 mass shootings more than 34 000 lives have been cut short by someone using a gun the house of representatives has held 30 moments of silence for the victims of mass shootings since sandy hook and yet we havent taken a single vote on legislation that would help keep guns out of dangerous hands i think that is shameful the american people deserve more than silence the american people deserve a congress that is willing to stand up and do whatever it takes to keep our communities safe that starts by making sure that terrorists criminal domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill dont have easy access to purchase guns in our country today suspected terrorists can legally buy guns in our country individuals who are on the fbis terrorist watch list can walk into a gun store pass a background check and walk out with a gun or the guns of their choosingand they can do it legally since 2004 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists were able to purchase guns more than 90 percent of all suspected terrorists who tried to purchase guns in the last 11 years walked away with the weapon that they went in to buy now in the wake of the horrific attacks in orlando congress must make it a priority to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of suspected terrorists there is bipartisan legislation that would prohibit those on the terrorist watch list from being able to purchase firearms in our country this bill is common sense if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun it is long past time for the republican leadership to bring that bill up for a vote we also need to pass my bipartisan bill to require background checks for all commercial gun sales background checks are our first line of defense when it comes to stopping dangerous people from getting firearms we know that background checks work every day they stop more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun unfortunately in 34 states criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill can bypass a background check by purchasing guns online or at a gun show this is a dangerous loophole that needs to be closed yesterday senate republicans blocked consideration of no fly no buy legislation and a measure to strengthen and enhance background checks now the republican house is going on with business as usual without giving the american people a vote to help prevent gun violence in our country if the republican leadership agrees

consumer financial protection bureau which congress created to protect all americans from predatory loans that led to millions of foreclosures many of which were in the african american community the

completely eradicate hepatitis c for our nations veterans and so we raised the amount for funding for treatment to 1 5 billion additionally in order to combat veterans homelessness suicide and ptsd we have also included 7 5 billion for mental healthcare services that being said it is high time that we return to regular order and by regular order i mean the process that starts with a realistic allocation enabling the appropriations committee to meet our nations fiscal needs i believe that if the appropriations committee were given a fair chance we could have completed our work months ago the process has much room for improvement governing through the use of omnibus is not a wise practice so i believe that we must work to return to regular order utilizing the entire legislative process to determine how our government invests in the american people truly regular order is better for the committee for the members and for this august institution in which we serve nevertheless while the omnibus is not perfect far from it we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good this is a good bill and i urge my colleagues to pass it"]]}
