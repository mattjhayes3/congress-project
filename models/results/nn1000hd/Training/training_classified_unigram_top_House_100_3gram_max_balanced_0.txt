out of the poverty cycle but the program has serious problems too many of the students who need these loans the most are unfortunately also defaulting on repaying their federal education loans and

the big question is how do we solve e the problem the administration c congress and the educational commu n nity are all looking at it and each has c come up with a different solution the administration through educa d tion secretary bennett proposes to v identify schools with the highest de v fault rates and then penalize those d schools if their default rates are not t decreased t some membersof congress are sug e gesting that we change the current s program by offering only grants to b students in their first 2 yearssince many defaulters are students who i have dropped out of their training s programs before they finished then i we would allow only loans for students i in their third and fourth years of post secondary education c a third plan is being offered by proprietary schools owners they have put together a manual for school officials which gives stepbystep instructions for setting up a student loan counseling program with followup activities each of these groups is focusing on this serious problem of student loan defaults but as we can see its difficult to agree on a single solution each approach has some merits and i am going to address them in more detail later but before i get to that id like to give you a little background on gsl the guaranteed student loan program was created in 1965 and has grown to a national program which last year provided 8 6 billion in loans to 3 5 million students during the last 6 years the loan default rate has ranged from a high of 9 7 percent in 1981 to a low of 8 3 percent in 1984 last years rate was 9 4 percent which represents a cost to the agency of 1 6 billion since college costs have been rising at twice the rate of inflation throughout the 1980s its becoming harder and harder for students and their parents to pay with all of the recent cuts and limitations on grants and student aid the gsl program has become i vital for millions of students but unfortunately some of these students are defaulting on their student loans the administrations solution was pror posed last month by secretary of education bennett his plan involves targeting schools with students who are i at high risk of defaulting based on data kept by the gsl program i once the schools have been identi fled the secretary will work with them to reduce the default rates of s their students if the students fail to repay their loans then the school might lose its guaranteed student loan eligibility d shortly after bennetts plan was proposed a report by the department l of educations inspector generals r office found that the default data e which the secretary used in his prob posal contained significant errors and that use of the data will result in the iepartment of education making inorrect decisions in monitoring and nanaging the multibilliondollar luaranteed student loan program in spite of the unreliability of this ata secretary bennett is going ahead rith his plan to try to targetschools ith high default rates if the stuents from these targeted schools coninue to default on their loans then he department of education will ither limit suspend or terminate a chools guaranteed student loan eligiility one of the criticisms of bennetts lan is that the burden is on the chool to prove that it should not lose ts eligibility to qualify for gsl loans eligibility decisions are also not suffiiently reviewed and many schools could be dropped from the gsl program unfairly another problem with the secretarys default reduction proposal is that it fails to mention that school officials cannot easily and accurately identify students who have defaulted on loans because school officials are denied access to loan default information if schools cannot identify defaulting students then they should not be held responsible for their students who default but that is exactly just what secretary bennett proposes schools should possibly shoulder some of the responsibility for student loan defaults but its basically not their fault since after all schools dont default on loans students do in congress my colleagues on the education and labor committee and i are primarily focusing on students as we consider various options to control student loan defaults as i mentioned earlier one of the bills restructures the federal student grant and loan programs to allow firstand secondyear students to receive only grants and no loans students would be eligible for gsl loans only after the completion of their second year but for all students the loans and grants would be provided on the same need basis another alternative might tie the grant and loan programs more closely to family income so that we establish two income levelsa low one for grants and a slightly higher one for loan eligibility for example we might determine that applicants for postsecondary education whose family income was below 20 000 a year might be eligible for grants alone while families with an annual income which falls between 20 000 and 30 000 might be eligible for loans with adequate funding either of these congressional proposals might improve the student loan and grant programs and ensure that all worthy students receive the postsecondary aid they need a third approach to the default problem has been developed by the orhl11472 ganizations and associations which they are helping them become proteach students who have the highest ductive taxpaying citizens risk of defaulting in fact a recent comprehensive this program is called the private study by the university of arkansas career schools default management indicated that even if every student in initiative and it was started by the na the country defaulted on his or her tional association of trade and tech guaranteed student loan the governnical schools and the association of ment would still benefit on the avertrade and technical associations age taxable earnings increase with they have been joined by the nation education so the government would al association of health career receive enough in increased taxes from schools the national association of these educated students to pay for accredited cosmetology schools and their loans the national home study council congress and the adtwo weeks ago they released their ministration need to work together default management manual to with members of the educational and suggest ways for schools to reduce the vocational training communities to number of gsl defaults design a fair and workable plan for reafter the manual outlines who de ducing defaults on guaranteed student faults and why it describes a model loans default prevention program that can i encourage all of my colleagues to easily be adopted by any school which work with members of the education uses gsl loans it is extremely practi and labor committee as we look critical and its sponsors are going to spend cally at secretary bennetts proposal the next 5 months explaining their de and as we develop more equitable and fault management program to schools realistic alternatives the individual across the united states followup and loan counseling procethe default management manual dures contained in the default manis clearly written it can be easily agement manual are very good steps adapted to any type of school and it to reducing the default problem which gives sound advice to students and could be adopted by federal loan schools involved with the gsl pro agencies gram in light of cuts in government instead of reducing the number of spending for academic and vocational highrisk students in the gsl pro education we need to work to gram as secretary bennett proposes strengthen and improve the gsl prowe should use a more reasonable and gram the millions of students who recompassionate approach similiar to ceive gsl loans depend upon us to the one taken by members of the de ensure that they are able to pay for fault management initiative their training faut no

good job because reduc students it wuld ot ing loan defaults is one of their biggest students who need education and job concerns training the most and itiwould create conrns uetsa cmunt a discriminatory educational system along with students at community if that happened it would eliminate colleges and historically black colleges many of the gains we have made since students at trade and technical schools the higher education act passed in are most likely to default on student 1965 loans a high percentage of these stu whatever we do disadvantaged and dents have lost their jobs and are seek highrisk students must not be forgoting retraining others come from inner ten because they need and deserve city ghettos from disadvantaged mi access to postsecondary education nority groups or from areas with few money spent on education is a way for social or educational opportunities these men and women to obtain in my congressional district outside useful meaningful jobs and to imof pittsburgh 10 years ago there were prove their standards of living it is over 63 000 steelworkers right now also an investment in the future thereare about 21 000 so in 10 years strength and vitality of the american 40 000 jobs have just disappeared people most of those 40 000 workers didnt just retire they had to find new jobs to support themselves and their fami 0 1910 lies and many of them took advantage of the trade and technical schools in release of declassified my area thousands of them were re information on nicaragua trained at the same types of trade and the speaker pro tempore under technical schools which the secretary a previous order of the house the genof education proposes to eliminate tleman from indiana is from the gsl program recognized for 60 minutes now i wont deny that there are mr burton of indiana mr some schools which have abused the speaker i want to thank the gentlegsl program but the vast majority man from marylandfor sticking with are making a tremendous contribution us tonight i know he wants to get to american society private forprofit down to the white house for the fesschools are giving millions of men and tivities the christmas party the presiwomen jobrelated practical training dent is throwing down there and we will try to make this as brief as possible today the state department and the defense intelligence agency and the cia released and declassified some information given to the government of the united states by the defector major roger miranda bengoechea who was a very high official in the communist sandinista government major miranda has served as the deputy chief of the sandinista forces the personal administrative assistant to minister of defense humberto ortego and aid to the chief of the general staff miranda became chief of the secretariat in early 1982 the secretariat is the only entity that reports directly to the defense minister humberto ortego giving then major miranda more executive power than the chief of the general staff who is the major general miranda defected after visiting the nicaraguan battlefields where he says he noted that the resistance forces were not mercenaries but compesinos from the local population the nicaraguan resistance forces are the legitimate representatives of the interests and hopes of the nicaraguan people that is the contras he said after being out in the battlefields miranda said in an interview since his defection he also said he was disgusted with the corruption that is destroying the sandinista cause on october 25 he went to mexico for a physical a supposed physical and he and his wife went to the american embassy and defected since that time he has been meeting with our government officials telling them what the intentions of the communist sandinista government really are not what they tell the press not what they tell the people who believe in them but what the facts really are today when they declassified this information i became very concerned and thought this ought to be conveyed to all my colleagues and to the america people some of the major revelations are these there is going to be a continued military buildup that calls for increased soviet bloc military aid over the next 7 years the soviet union sent 14 000 tons of military assistance into nicaragua 3 years ago 18 000 tons of military supplies 2 years ago last year they sent 23 000 tons of military supplies in and this year it is going to be between 32 000 and 36 000 tons it is a tremendous military buildup major miranda says the soviet union has promised the sandinistas mig21 high performance aircraft now our government has said they will not allow that kind of aircraft on the northamerican continent because of the possibility of spying on the western coast of the united states the possibility that they could build up a military force big enough to take over all of central america and up into mexico and force the united hl11473 states to defend our southern flank nevertheless they have signed a secret agreement with the soviet union that will require that the sandinistas by 1991 get mig21 and possibly mig23 high performance fighter aircraft the migs are now expected to come sometime around 1991 or after the sandinistas also have requested more mi25 hind helicopters as if they do not have enough already that is the flying tank mi17 hip helicopters and an an26 transport aircraft the sandinistas intend to build an army and militia totalling a half a million men we were told up to now that it was going to be a quarter of a million men far in excess of all the other governments of central america combined and now we are told it is going to be a half a million man army humberto ortega in a speech delivered on saturday said they were going to increase them to 600 000 men in the military service many more armored personnel carriers selfpropelled howitzers antitank weapons surfacetoair missiles and antiaircraft guns are expected or already have been delivered they requested and are going to get three new 400ton naval vessels miranda said the sandinista commandante think that the only way of guaranteeing the development of their marxist program in nicaragua is to construct a powerful army one can sign agreements one can appear to be more flexible in the political system but they will never negotiate the development of their massive army they know that their power rests in the long run in the size of that army miranda went on that the sandinistas do not have any desire to negotiate the size of that army that they plan to have in nicaragua yes they are going to sit down and talk but after months of discussion they are going to say that they did not arrive at any agreement they are just trying to buy time to kill the contras let them die on the vine i think that is the most vulnerable point where they show the least desire to reach peace in central america according to miranda the sandinistas have continued to support the salvadoran insurgents the guerrillas the communist guerrillas in el salvador in spite of the central american peace plan as a matter of fact he told us yesterday at a meeting that they were giving additional aid to the communist guerrillas in el salvador after the peace accords were signed in guatemala in august so they signed a peace agreement saying they were going to work for peace down there and follow democratic principles and not export revolution and after that they continued to export revolutionary materials and supplies into el salvador he went on that at the request of guerrilla leader joiquin villalobos humberto ortega agreed in september 1987 to provide training in the use of surfacetoair missiles to salvadoran guerrillas they are training communist guerrillas from el salvador in nicaragua today they said they were not doing that but they are in fact training communist guerrillas in nicaragua that are fighting to undermine the government of el salvador they are also exporting revolutionary supplies into guatemala and honduras in october 1987 15 salvadoran guerrillas completed a 35day course in using a variety of surfacetoair missiles the training conducted in nicaragua was approved by the sandinistas the sandinista commandantes this entire weapons supply operation is handled by the clandestine entity known as the bureau which is run by commandante bayardo arce i met with bayardo arce sunday evening at the airport in managua this past sunday he told me that they were building not to a 600 000man army but to a 1millionman army weapons bound for el salvador costa rica colombia and other latin american guerrilla groups are shipped via commercial vessels and arrive from cuba and are stored in managua and are sent on to their designated targets the peace plan they plan to use as a weapon to deceive the american people to deceive the american government and to further their attempts to undermine all of the fledgling democracies in central america here is what he had to say the sandinistas have no intention of complying with the guatemala peace accords bear in mind this gentleman was one of the chiefs in the sandinista government he was the deputy assistant to humberto ortega the defense minister of nicaragua and he brought documents with him verifying everything he said to us it has been checked out the sandinistas have no intention of complying with the guatemala peace accords cuban and soviet advisers have told the sandinistas to talk about democracy pluralism and reform the goal of building a marxist state is to be downplayed he said they the sandinistas do not have the will to achieve that peace they had already made an agreement with the soviets and the cubans on plans for the sandinista army for the next 8 years with what desire then are they going to talk of peace when at the same time in the back of their minds they are thinking about creating one of the most powerful armies in latin america with an armament that few other armies in latin america have we are talking about selfpropelled artillery we are talking about mig21s we are talking about new 400ton battleships for the navy that no other central american country has he said the sandinistas had begun to recognize that the resistance enjoys a base of support in the countryside among the compesinos the real people an important social base in fact it is one of the fundamental facts that permits one to explain why after so many of the sandinista popular army offensives they are still out there the resistance in the nicaraguan countryside is like a fish in water he said plans to invade costa rica honduras and capture united states personnel and property in response to any direct united states military action is a real probability he said in the event of direct united states intervention if we think we are threatened or we must come to the rescue of honduras el salvador or guatemala he said in the event of direct united states intervention in nicaragua the sandinistas would attempt to regionalize and protract the conflict by sending helicopters and troops to invade costa rica which has no army destroy infrastructure targets and the united states embassy in san jose a sandinista battalion will simultaneously attack honduras this has just been declassified the american people and my colleagues in the congress need to be aware of this because many of my colleagues on that side of the aisle tell us that we do not have to worry about the sandinistas going beyond the borders of nicaragua that they promised freedom democracy freedom of assembly freedom of the press freedom of religion and all the things that we hold dear i might recommend to my colleagues they read what they promised in 1979 when they took power which were the same things that they promised in guatemala in august of this year they did not keep the promises then they are not going to keep them now and mr miranda has pointed out exactly what they plan for us he said that the sandinista government the hierarchy considers both the democrats and the republicans their enemies because we both want to end the revolution down there we just have different ways to approach it he did say however that democrats are more foolish than republicans because they are more malleable he said that i did not say that some things i think that need to be pointed out tomy colleagues are what is really going on down there as respects the poor people who are having to endure this communist totalitarian government we were in a town called leon on sunday for a rally i thought there were going to be 400 or 500 people there we ended up having 7 000 i went into a crowded movie theater and it seated about 1 800 people we went in there and instead we could hardly find room to get in the place they hl11474 were waving flags they had a little local band they were beating drums and singing patriotic songs every person who spoke from the local area from the opposition parties said that the sandinistas and their repression was intolerable they were killing the country after the meeting we went outside and we marched down the streets with these people who were waving their flags and chanting for freedom seven thousand people were involved in that little town when they passed the headquarters of the communist sandinista military they were waving their fists and saying sandinistas must go and they were making other comments as well we met with some of the business people at the conclusion of that meeting and i want to tell my colleagues what they said has happened to this economy since the sandinistas took power in 1979 cattle production and beef sales for export has gone from 70 million pounds to 10 million pounds a 700percent drop the cotton growers in 1979 exported 650 000 bales of cotton this year it is going to be 189 000 bales of cotton a drop of about 600 or 500 percent the small producers who produce cotton went from 5 000 to 270 they talked about the loss of techhology they had 2 000 engineers in the country 1 500 have fled they talked about in 1979 the exports from the government of somoza when he fled was 200 million in exports and now it is 10 million a drop of 2 000 percent they had 22 multinational corporations in nicaragua in 1978 and 1979 and that has now dropped to six in 1979 when the sandinistas took power they communized 75 percent of the industry there is no foreign currency to replace the aging industrial base and equipment now there are no technical advisers to help with the technical problems of the country the average worker down there the average worker is now making between 5 and 17 a month and for that he has to work 48 hours a week plus he has to donate 12 hours to the sandinista government that is a total of 60 hours of work for 5 to 17 a week that means that the one person who works will be able to feed himself probably twice a day and that does not include his famly as a result of this the black market has gone wild on the black market 70 percent of the commerce in that country is conducted while i was down there i bought some currency on entering the country one must buy currency at the airport or one cannot get into the country i have here an old cordoba currency when the sandinistas came into power shortly after this piece of currency was printed and this is a 20cordoba bill i bought this one which is the same bill but my colleagues will notice over the top of it is printed 20 000 when i was down there 2 months ago the exchange rate was 7 200 cordobas for 1 unitedstates dollar when i went back this weekend it was 15 000 cordobas for 1 unitedstates dollar and that is the official rate on the black market it is double that 30 000 cordobas for 1 unitedstates dollar one cannot buy anything the money is worthless the money is getting more worthless all the time it is only worth a few cents now this 20 000cordoba bill is worth 67 cents and when somoza the tyrant fled the country it was 10 cordoba for 1 unitedstates dollar each cordoba was worth 10 cents now 20 000 cordobas are worth 67 cents is it any wonder the people cannot eat they are starving they are dying on the vine we need to make our colleagues in the unitedstates congress and the people across this country aware of that fact humberto ortega in a speech this weekened after major miranda made these revelations said yes they are building toward a 600 000man army yes they are exporting revolution yes they are training guerrillas in their own country and yes they are planning to get soviet mtg21s and other aircraft major miranda has been supported by the defense minister himself in what major miranda has said this morning in the washington post the speaker of this house of representatives said that the speech was preposterous the speech by the defense minister humberto ortega he described the speech as outrageous and counterproductive he said that it was it was intemperate and irrational i would like to conclude by saying what does it take to convince the leader of this house what does it take to convince the majority of the congressman in the democrat party in this house to believe what these people are all about a defector a military major the assistant to the secretary of defense down there of nicaragua the defense minister humberto ortega has told us of the vast military buildup that they are planning humberto ortega himself has told us the same thing and yet members on that side of the aisle still do not believe my concern is are we going to wait until el salvador is undermined and falls are we going to wait until honduras falls and costa rica falls are we going to wait until they get into guatemala and southern mexico before we respond we should be supporting the contras who are fighting not only for their own freedom and the promises of democracy made to their people in 1979 and again in august in esquipulas guatemala but also for the freedoms and the security of the united states as well we have a 1 980mile border between us and mexico we cannot even keep illegal aliens out all of my colleagues know that last year we passed the simpsonmazzoli immigration reform bill and in that bill we allowed anybody who has been in this country illegally for 5 years or more to get permanent resident status because we could not find them and get them out this year we said if they had been here 5 years or longer and they wanted to bring their families up here they can bring their families up even though they came in illegally we are going to give permanent resident status to them because we cannot control the border and we will make them unitedstates citizens and it is going to cost us dearly in welfare costs housing costs social security costs and jobs because a lot of those people work for a heck of a lot less so we have a lot of pressure on us because we cannot keep illegal aliens from coming across the border can my colleagues imagine what it is going to be like if humberto ortegas prophecy in what he promises to do takes place if they can consolidate power and crush the contras in nicaragua and accomplish that because we do not act in this body then they will rapidly export revolution or even more rapidly export revolution into el salvador costa rica honduras guatemala and up into mexico they told us time and again what they plan to do yet the leadership in this house and the majority in this house continues to believe that it aint so well it is so if we have to defend that 2 000mile border it is going to cost us dearly in manpower our young boys are going to be down there fighting and dying to defend that southern flank the soft underbelly of america it is going to cost us billions of dollars and we are going to get 5 10 20 million people fleeing those countries and coming into this country as refugees not as illegal aliens as refugees we are going to have to deal with that it is going to cost us dearly it is estimated if we get 5 million to 10 million refugees coming into this country it will increase unemployment among americans by 5 percent to 7 percent and for each 1 percent of unemployment it costs the taxpayers of this country 30 billion that is 150 billion to 210 billion in just lost jobs not to mention the vast amount of expense it will cost to defend a 2 000mile border between the united states and mexico or if we have to to send them down into honduras when i met with president azcona in tegucigalpa honduras he told me face to face that if the peace process fails and if the contras are destroyed because of lack of will in this body that they do not get any more aid from us to fight the fight for freedom down there that he is going to have to hl11475 request 50 000 americans be stationed in honduras and he is going to ask for 250 million in additional military aid he has told us that is what he will have to do in el salvador that fledgling democracy is going to need assistance so is costa rica which does not have an army and guatemala will need assistance as well either we do what is necessary now by helping the contras or we are going to have to pay dearly later many people had doubts about this before and i can understand that because we have been debating it a lot and we have heard different stories coming across the national news media but now we have the facts the defense minister of nicaragua himself has told us what he plans to do major miranda has given us secret documents that show the secret agreements that they have signed with the soviets there is no question about it now the unitedstates congress when we come back after the holidays must vote for additional contra aid if we do not we are going to rue the day it is that old statement that has been made in television commercials for years when they show a guy with a fram oil filter on television and he says you can either pay me now or pay me later the implication is if you buy fram oil filters you are going to keep your engine in good shape and you will not have to pay for major repairs for your automobile engine someplace down the road the statement i am making tonight is you can pay now by helping the contras fight for freedom and give them the wherewithal to put that country into the free column as was promised them in 1979 and again

president you would be the president and you stood out there and told me that you were being hammered on by the far left forces of your party and that your votesthose were the days when you had to vote as speaker you only have to vote when you feel like it or to break a tieyou said that your votes were not reflective of your true feelings on national security and defense i said i am going to remember this conversation jim and i am going to remember this moment and right where we are standing because i expect you to start acting like a texan who loves his country once you are the speaker

this particular amendment first of all let me make the point that we have already allocated 392 million to studying alternative basing modes what we are talking about in this particular bill is not further study because the money for further study is already available last year we provided 120 million more to study alternative basing modes for the mx those moneys are still available in this

rail mobile garrison basing for the mx there is already available 85 to 90 million and by voting to knock out or eliminate this 250 million we are not precluding further study or exploration of the idea of rail mobile basing as an alternative basing mode for the mx missile what we are precluding at this point in time is a goahead a startup on a program which will ultimately cost 10 to 15 billion because the 250 million which is in the bill now is not for concept exploration it is the initial installment the first downpayment on a train of outlays that will ultimately in the aggregate equal 10 to 15 billion and will lead us to 25 hardened trains deployed at some 10 sac bases with 50 additional mx missiles deployed in addition to thosethat are deployed now in minuteman silos the cost of that

explained the site would include the former presidents home and boyhood home the plains high school and grounds the plains railroad depot which served as the carter campaign headquarters a 100foot wide corridor on either side of the old plains highway leading to the boyhood home and the gnann house adjacent to the carter residence h r 2416 requires that the carter residence the railroad depot and the plains high school be acquired through donation only the national park service would seek to acquire easements on the road frontage near the boyhood home the gnann house is to be acquired by the admin istrator of the general services administration for security purposes during the lives of former president and mrs carter after which time it will be transferred to the secretary of the interior to be used for administrative purposes the preservation district is to preserve and interpret jimmy carters life and the town of plains ga including the role which agriculture played in the development of the area the preservation district will encompass 650 acres upon which the secretary may acquire preservation easements and provide technical assistance in marking and interpreting the area the bill also establishes an advisory commission to assist with interpretation at the site it further requires the development of a management plan concerning the use and development of the historic site and preservation district while i am not opposed to the establishment of a historic site for former president carter i would like to note for the record it appears this would be the most extensive site within the national park system associated with a former president hence it will probably be the most expensive as well the estimated costs for acquisition and development of the site exceed 3 million annual maintenance costs are estimated atover onehalf million dollars therefore i am concerned about the costs associated with h r 2416 in light of the enormous federal budget deficits i am especially concerned about the inclusion of the plains high school in the site as it would be by far the most expensive property to restore operate and maintain in an effort to partially address this concern i worked with the subcommittee chairman and the bills sponsor richard ray and developed a compromise to improve the bill during the committee process i offered several minor amendments to assist in reducing the potential cost of the site along with a major amendment to require that 40 percent of the estimated 1 5 million needed for the restoration of the plains high school come from nonfederal entities and to place a 3 5 million cap on the appropriations authorization for acquisition and development of the site all of the amendments were adopted i do not feel the costsharing requirement imposes too great of a burden on the town of plains since the nonfederal share of the costs may be in the form of goods and services in addition other nonfederal entities such as the state government and historical and preservation organizations could certainly assist in meeting the 40 percent funding requirement as members may recall similar legislation was considered in the last congress in combination with a measure by my colleague from california representative dannemeyer to establish a historic site for former president richard nixon however since that time the nixon birthplace foundation utilizing private funds has acquired and began operation of a nixon site in yorba linda ca which includes the nixon birthplace consequently at the foundations request the establishment of a nixon site within the national park system has not been under consideration in this congress while i remain concerned about the costs of the carter site i do feel my amendments improve the bill primarily by requiring appropriate costsharing by nonfederal entities in this regard i want to thank the sponsor of h r 2416 mr ray and the subcommittee chairman mr vento for working with me to help address my concerns their cooperation is greatly appreciated"], [0.00012218952178955078, 0.49987781047821045, 0, "i am here today to discuss our countrys strategic and critical minerals supply and our relationship with the nation of south africa i do this in response to those in this country in this congress who propose that we extend the import prohibitions of the antiapartheid act to include these strategic and critical materials that we refuse to deal in any way with the racially repressive government of south africa that we simply turn to alternative sources for the materials so vital to our domestic industry and national defense these proposals generally are framed in terms of human compassion of moraloutrage of righteous indignation of wishful thinking they are seldom however framed in terms of reality it is the difference between a painting anda photograph one can reflect the world as we would wish it to be the other can only show it as it is and though we might wish to create a portrait of an equitable and peaceful world we must live with a reality more frightening than most want to admit that reality is this south africa is one of a few predominant sources of many of the strategic minerals the united states must have to survive as a nation in the most important cases the other major source is the soviet union it is this even though the antiapartheid act at least initially exempted strategic minerals from its import bans there still has been a demonstrable shift from reliance on south africaone of our alliesto reliance on the soviet union andits allies and it is this the united states is unpreparedand in many cases unableto produce its own supplies of strategic materials at this time a headline in the august 3 1987 issue of barrons asked antiapartheld or prosoviet our current course of action is both that is frightening that is dangerous and like all reality it is supported by fact in testimony prepared for a hearing before the house subcommittee on mining and natural resources on december 10 john ferriter deputy assistant secretary of state for energy and resources polic outlined the vital mineral commodities south africa supplies to the united states and other free world nations a number of those commodities are strategic and critical materials most notably chromium which is essential to stainless steel and superalloy production and in the defense aerospace chemical power generation and transportation industries cobalt which is used in jet aircraft engines and in tools mining and drilling equipment magnets and catalysts manganese which is necessary for steel and cast iron production platinum which is essential for reducing automotive exhaust emissions refining petroleum and in the production of fertilizers explosives and other chemicals and used in electrical and electronic equipment and vanadium which is used principally in steelmaking to say these materials are vital to our economy and our defense is not an overstatement economically the unitedstates department of commerce reports that more than 3 million american jobs are directly related to the processing and use of strategic and critical metals militarily these materials maypecome even more critical as our loe affair with glasnost has produced a treaty that would force us to strengthen our conventional forces to meet the soviet threat world supplies of these materials are available from only a limited number of sources one of these sourcessouth africawill remain an important supplier for a number of reasons nature has blessed it with an ample resource base its economy depends upon their mining and export its government encourages resource development its realiability as a suphl11673 plier in world markets and the quality of those supplies is highly regarded south africa should remain an important supplier for another reason for some applications of some materials there are no substitutes or alternative sources of supply other than the soviet union and its allies this necessity again is reality and the alternative is unacceptable the antiapartheid act prohibited united states imports of most commodities from south africa the act also threatened to prohibit currently legal imports of strategic minerals from south africa if significant progress has not been made in establishing a nonracial democracy and though these strategic and critical materials were initially exempted from the bans the act has resulted in an increase in the number of strategic and critical materials purchased from sovietbloc countries as noted at the hearing there are a number of possible explanations for such increases including soviet needs for hard currency in light of lower oil prices increased minerals production in the soviet union and rapidly rising demand here in the united states there is also reason to believe however that the act and the uncertainty it engendered with its threat of future sanctions have played a role in influencing american buyers to seek diversification of their sources other factors too have surfaced in testimony at the december 10 hearing robert dale wilson executive director of the national critical materials council reported new york metals traders who said it was easier to trade with the soviet union than with south africa becausewith the formerthere were no protestors parading outside the office traders also reportedly have decided it is safer to deal with the soviets given the emotionalism of the south africa congressional debate how significant are these increases information from the unitedstates depart ment of commerce bureau of census and office of strategic resources shows that in the 12month period since this congress overrode a presidential veto to pass the antiapartheid act unitedstates imports of key metals from the soviet union have risen as follows platinum sponge 17 percent chrome ore refrac 157 percent platinum bars 321 percent ferrosilicon 377 percent rhodium 386 percent antimony 4 783 percent and industrial diamonds 4 900 percent the irony here is that south african exports have not suffered these primary products have a steady market the world over and even if our soviet swing might have played a role in the slowdown of real growth in south africa we would have contributed to both current unemployment and diminished prospectsboth of which would target and neither of which would benefit nonwhite south africans who seek participation in and fairness from their government writing in barrons weekly shirley hobbs scheibla summed it up for many of us when she said one must auk why the united states should believe that racial injustice in south africa warrants action drastic enough to harm this country but should embrace trade with the soviet union which puts millions of its own people in gulags and commits untold atrocities abroad unitedstates foreign policy sheibla concluded should have two objectives to achieve its intended aims and to advance the nations interests on both counts sanctions against south africa have failed this again is reality it is not a pretty painting of what we wish would have happened but an accurate picture of what has occurred what other choices do we have right now not many can we do without these materials of course not as malcolm browne wrote in the new york times this past july a total lack of these metals would shut down or throttle the steel automotive chemical plastics and petroleum industires it would halt production of optical fiber for the communications industry it would severely hobble the production of food computer components and weapons given this i would ask my colleagues is it reasonableand responsiblefor us to trade a reliable business partner for a supplier who could shut us off in a wordwho actually would benefit by doing so orto discuss a lesser degreeis it reasonable and responsible for us to trade a reliable business partner for a supplier who through its exclusivity could manipulate the price of materials to levels our industry could not afford or that would put our industry at a supreme competitive disadvantage worldwide is it reasonable and responsible to do this to the american consumer who would suffer in the end dont any nations other than south africa and soviet bloc produce these materials yes but most of these producers are troubled lesser developed countries which are unstable and unreliable sources of materials we depend upon what about our own resources yes what about them david s brown acting director of the bureau of mines testified that he believes that an economically viable domestic mining and mineral and materials processing industry is the most significant approach to reducing our vulnerability to strategic mineral supply disruptions and the bureau is working to that end it has its work cut out for it the united states mining industry differs from that of south africa in many ways not the least of which is its reliance on a federal government that often does more to work against it than to help it a government that doesnt think twice about channeling money to international institutions that lend it out to our competitors we know a far different situation exists in south africa where mining is important because the government made it important where mining has provided the impetus for south africas development from an agricultural into an industrial economy where the industry supports a large segment of thelabor force providing 16 percent of south africas gross domestic product and 60 percent of its export earnings where that governments policy is to encourage private enterprise to develop the countrys mineral resources and through its own auspices provide leasing arrangements for exploration and infrastructure for development among the bureaus suggestions for developing american mining are these a research and development program emphasizing more efficient domestic mining process and recycling technology to facilitate domestic production of strategic and critical materials and substitution for an conservation of available supplies a domestic research identification and evaluation program that focuses on identifying and evaluating strategic and critical mineral resources with high resource potential in all the coterminus states alaska hawaii and the territories analytic and information capabilities which provide an early warning of potential vulnerability problems and help facilitate the planning of effective policy actions a regulatory initiative that seeks to reduce unnecessary cost burdens on the domestic industry and an advanced materials initiative which analyzes the impact of these materials on strategic and critical material requirements and future supply vulnerability the bureau is to be applauded for its work and vision but it should also be noted that some outside the bureau who see such solutions as longterm timeconsuming and costly as malcolm browne reported in the new york times but many experts believe that short term prospects are poor for reducing the dependence of western industrial nations on a handful of mineralrich countries especially south africa and the soviet union one reason is that low metal prices have depressed the mining industry and hampered innovation and investment in the words of lorne a wrigglesworth senior geologist at falconbridge nickel mines in toronto the economic conditions of the minerals industries in the industrialized countries is bloody awful so while the problem is apparent solutions are not to further explain let me quote from the testimony given before the subcommittee on mining and natural resources by james santini a representative of the national december 17 1 987 strategic materials and minerals prograin advisory committee and a former member of congress who once chaired the very subcommittee to which he spoke the basic problem is very straightforward how do we reduce our dependence so that in event of a disruption our industry and concomitantly our ability to defend this country are not crippled but while the problem is simple the solution is not to be sure given unlimited funds the solution would be a piece of cake we could invest in the development of marginal deposits of critical materials both here and abroad we could stockpile vast quantities of the materials we could unleash a massive new research and development program aimed at developing exotic new materials to substitute for those on which we now rely we could do many many things but the cost of such programs would make the current defense budget look like petty cash and would dislocate a good deal of the world economy in the process so as usual we come down to the painful prosaic task of making intelligent tradeoffs among realistic options and these must be options it should be stressed which incur little or no incremental costs among suggestions made by the committee santini noted were that the bureau of mines undertake a priority study to locate sources of critical materials and minerals in the united states and to recommend appropriate incentives that would be necessary to their exploitation and development and that the united states pursue a course of allowing the greatest access for environmentally sound development of domestic mineral resources especially for commodities available from very limited foreign sources let me dwell here for a moment as a member of a mining state as a citizen of a state that is 65 percent federally owned and the proposed site of millions of additional acres of wilderness as a member of the interior committee i have a special interest here and i concur wholeheartedly with the point mr santini made at the hearing this country must rethink its landuse policies it cannot continue to lock up its lands blindly not knowingnot even seeking to knowwhether it is locking up materials crucial to its survival it especially cannot do this knowingly hearing referred to as this nation and this congress cutting off its nose tb spite its face it would say it is more it is ourclosing our eyes to reality it is our responsibility as members of congress to represent the people of these united states their best interests we may have warm compassion for anothers family our cold duty is to our own this does not mean we do not care and that we cannot help how can we do this by continuing our call for equal economic rights for all in south africa by relying less on punitive actions and more on diplomatic and humanitarian efforts by ensuring that our misguided attempts to help people does not actually harm them by looking at the big picture at the true picture and at the clear picture lets look at that picture lets understand what we see and lets set a course that is not only compassionate but realistic and responsible as well peoplethe world overare
