general applicants for broadcast licenses must satisfy the fcc that they are legally technically and financially qualified and that operation of the proposed station would be in the public interest one of the primary considerations in granting applications and assigning broadcast frequencies is to avoid interference with other stations on the same channel in am radio broadcasting the audio waves are transmitted by groundwaves which follow the contour of the ground and at nighttime by skywaves which dart upward into the atmosphere and are reflected back to earth by electrical particles in the ionosphere during daylight skywave signals are lost and radio stations rely primarily on groundwaves to transmit broadcasts at night skywaves cover tremendous distances and greatly expand the range of radio transmission but skywaves also cause interference to local stations and therefore the fcc has forced the small stations off the air accordingly under current fcc rules roughly onehalf of unitedstates am broadcasting stations cease operation from sunset until sunrise to eliminate interference to the skywave service of the remaining stations the classification scheme adopted for the 107 unitedstates am radio channels in the late 1930s following passage of the communications act of 1934 relied heavily on nighttime skywave transmission to extend radio service to rural areas the plan provided for 60 clear channels and 41 regional channels reliance upon skywave service however necessarily required that local service be limted thus only 6 channels were allocated for fvlltime local use even though the act clearly expresses a preference for local service stll such a plan was satisfactory in the 1930s because there was a need to extend quickly nationwide radio service at night and skywave signals appeared to be the fastest least costly way to do so notwithstanding the fact that skywave service is very unreliable and causes a great deal of mutual interference technological developments have dramatically changed the nature of broadcasting over the past 50 years today with the much greater degree of sophistication in television and radio broadcasting communities across the nation are no longer dependent upon nighttime skywave radio service to bring them the national news and provide entertainment they are presented with a myriad of electronic communications capabilities in addition to am and fm radio broadcasting ranging from television translator and cable television interconnected nationally by satellite microwave radio and landline and soon broadcasting satellites these various communications media are vigorously competing for the attention of consumers over vast geographical areas and they have had to develop program formats with broad national appeal unfortunately these changes in the nature of broadcasting services have been made at the cost of new programing for local markets with diverse needs and interests local communities throughout the united states can enjoy live satellite broadcasts of sports events around the world yet many of these same communities in which some 40 million americans live still have no local nighttime am service while presented with a host of national telecommunications services many americans still cannot receive adequate local nighttime am radio service the need for such local service is compounded by the recent trend of population migration to rural and nonmetropolitan areas between 1970 and 1974 the growth rate in such regions was nearly double that of counties with cities of 25 000 or more people the 1980 census reveals that this trend has continued and the people in these communities have demonstrated a decided preference for local am radio service reliance on nationwide nighttime skywave service has decreased markedly in recent years s0pporting this is a study commisstoned by the fcc to determine the extent to which the 25 nationwide class 1a clear channql radio stations continue to be utilized and relied upon by small towns and rural areas one part of the survey studied nighttime radio listening habits in 114 counties in remote white areas that is areas in which there is no good fm reception according to the fcc standards of engineering no clear interferencefree am radio signal could be received in any of these counties except from class 1a clear channel stations nevertheless the survey revealed that only 25 of the white area counties or less than 25 percent reported any listening to class 1a clear channels stations the other 89 counties surveyed showed no listening to class 1a clear channel stations whatsoever the study revealed that notwithstanding poor reception from local radio stations near these remote areas most of the nighttime radio listening was to stations in the general area the arbitron study shows clearly that radio listeners do not rely on the nighttime broadcasts of distant stations but instead prefer local programing even if there is poor reception the conclusion that radio listeners prefer local programing is bolstered by additional findings in the arbitron report a second part of the survey studied the daily 11stenership of the individual class 1a clear channel stations beyond their home market areas arbitron collected 159 689 diaries in which radio listeners kept records of the radio stations to which they listened the average percentage of mentions for class 1a stations outside the stations home market areas was only 1 3 percent again as dba noted it is apparent that radio listeners prefer to listen to broadcasts of nearby stations noble though it may have been in its origin the continued protection of nighttime skywave radio service works a travesty upon rural americans by failing to acknowledge and satisfy their much greater current need and desire for local service thus in granting applications for broadcast licenses or for the transfer or modification of existing licenses the federal communications commission should no longer consider the skywave signal of any broadcasting station in determining whether harmful interference will result from the applicants proposed broadcasting frequency the bill i am introducing today directs the commission to do just thatto assign local stations without regard to potential interference they may cause to the skywave of clear channel stations frankly it is a step long overdue since the arbitron study shows that most people do not listen to the skywave signal anyway and since present fcc standards prevent over 40 million americans from listening to their local am radio station at night it is time for a change the bill i am introducing will bring about that change and i invite my colleagues to join me in

of me concerned the military pay raise which we have before us today and most of the callers were career military personnel from all three services and the thing they repeated over and over again was that they deeply resented new recruits earning almost as much as they did after 10 or 12 years of service in my viewpoint they are absolutely right and i believe that is the best reason we need to provide pay increases to targeted groups within the military establishment make no mistake i believe that all members of the military require a sustantial pay increase but i am convinced that if we are to retain those men and women from those critical ranks where we are now iosing experience in droves we must provide extra incentive to these people to stay the men and women who called yesteday made it very clear that what we do on this bill before us today will play a major role in whether they remain in military service or whether they leave if for higher paying jobs in civilian life if we are going to have anything resembling military preparedness in years to come we are going to be relying on those middle level men and women in the enlisted ranks and in those middle ranks in the off icer corps to bring that about if we desert them today they almost certainly will desert their military careers as scon as their committments are up if we do nt target the pay increase to those necessa~ry skills we need to retain then it wit be us who become the eventual losers mr ch~airman as i stated earlier durovn general debate i believe that tht i0111 is basically a 5ood bill with rijy one exception it provides needed solutions to spcmffcally defined problems iidone exception however is the heart of the billthe military pay raise i believe there is general agreement heretoday that military pay may be out of line with the private sector and something must be done in the way of a catchup raise the only disagreement is over how this catchup raise should be spread the approach taken by the armed services committee suggests that all military personnel should receive the same 14 3percent raise on the surface this has the ring of fairness about it however a more thorough analysis shows this logic to be faulty when the allvolunteer force was established pay levels were designed to be competitive with similar jobs in private industry in addition a mechanism was included to provide adjustments in pay levels for inflation if the approach suggested by the armed services committee is correct over the last 10 years all military personnel have suffered equally at the hands of inflation this has clearly not been the case according to dods own pay adequacy study of 1979 the more experienced enlisted personnel were worse off than the more junior personnel when compared with civilian sector pay raises since 1972 furthermore the fact that retention not recruiting is the biggest defense manpower problem should indicate that it is time we stopped ignoring these talented people who form the backbone of our military establishment the estimated costs of the targeted and acrosstheboard approaches for the 14 3percent raise are roughly equal at 4 5 billion apiece in fiscal year 1982 you may hear some people say that the targeting approach is more costly since you do not now see the eventual increased retirement costs of 300 million i would like to point out what these people do not tell you for example to replace one experienced technician the rand corp estimates it takes two novices to have two novices on hand you must recruit three people since one will drop out before he finishes training when you work through the calculations it is easy to show that it is cheaper to retain one skilled individual than it is to recruit and train the three replacements necessary moreover who do you think can better maintain and operate sophisticated multibillion dollar weapons systemsa skilled sergeant or a new private first class pay grade briefly my amendment would vary the pay raise from 7 to 22 percent depending upon the rank but would still average 14 3 percent specifically a raw recruit would receive a raise of 7 percent a corporal would get 14 percent and sergeants and above would get raises ranging from 18 to 22 percent for officers the raises would range from 9 percent for a second lieutenant to a high of 16 5 percent for majors where the greatest officer retention problem exists and then back down to 12 percent for the top brass i will close my comments by quoting from an official department of army statement of manpower and personnel issues for fiscal year 1982 inequities in compensation tend to frustrate the desired manning of the force 0 at the inception of the allvolunteer force pay rates for lower enlisted grades were raised disproportionately to those of careerists in order to attract volunteers 0 a potential solution is reallocation of the annual pay adjustment for various grades the remaining alternative appears to be for congress to appropriate funds specif ically targeted on resolving pay compression since dod has not prepared a targeting plan the army is correct in proposing that it be done by the congress i urge you to support the amendment"]]}
