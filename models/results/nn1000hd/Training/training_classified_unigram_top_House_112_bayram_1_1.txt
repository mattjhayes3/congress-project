this bill once again fails to reach any measure of fairness and shared responsibility all of us agree that the implementation of sequestration would be a damaging harmful approach to take in an effort to achieve deficit reduction the difference between democrats and republicans is that instead of taking a balanced approach the republicans would replace sequestration with tax breaks to millionaires and special interests while ending the medicare guarantee slashing investments that strengthen our economy and shredding the social safety net not surprisingly important provisions of the affordable care act are in their sights the prevention and public health fund was an unprecedented investment in our nations health and wellbeing particularly the health of americas women and children by providing funding for vital cancer and infection screenings modernizing vaccine systems and the fight against epidemics like obesity and diabetes this fund truly invests in our nations health and it will provide savings down the line by helping to catch afflictions early by seeking to undermine the affordable care act the republican reconciliation bill would eliminate funding for hundreds of thousands of lifesaving screenings all to score political points with their extreme base just a few years ago when i was 41 years old i found a lump in my breast which was confirmed to be cancer in a series of screenings including a clinical screening just like the ones that this fund provides these screenings saved my life but this bill would prevent 326 000 women from having access to the same lifesaving screenings that i did it will prevent an estimated 10 300 women from being diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer in its early stages and it may cost them their lives furthermore this bill slashes funding for screening for birth defects developmental disabilities and hearing loss in children how can any of us in good conscience cut funding by cutting investments in childrens health frankly as a mom of three young kids im stunned because i think its just common sense that you dont pay down a deficit our children didnt create by compromising their health our constituents deserve a balanced approach to deficit reduction the republicans approach would deny women like me access to screenings that save lives and deny children the screenings they need so we can keep them healthy its unacceptable and i ask colleagues with a conscience to vote down this terrible bill"], [0.022685149684548378, 0.022685149684548378, 0, "paris s pough of columbus ga sgt jerry d reed ii of russellville

first night when we are in session but especially tonight as we close out black history month this is such an important time for this discussion i also thank you congresswoman christensen for your visionary and bold leadership as you continue to make history truly you have done remarkable work here in this body it is really especially poignant that this year during black history month the republican leadership has proposed a budget for fiscal year 2011 that will fall most heavily on the backs of the most vulnerable in our society african americans latinos and the poor those who have been shut out of the american dream at a time when we should be remembering and uplifting the accomplishments and contributions of african americans to the history culture civil rights and economy of america we are literally during this month debating steps that will severely undercut and undermine that legacy can we cut nearly 750 million from the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program while we have a record high unemployment rate throughout our country but especially among african americans we cant do that the unemployment rate among african americans is over 15 percent many african american women rely on wic while they seek jobs which we are trying to hopefully create how can we cut 317 million in funding for vital family planning health services provided through a network of clinics throughout the country that serves nearly one in five women these programs are vital not just in saving lives through cancer screening hiv and std testing and contraceptive services but for providing a link for the many poor and lowincome women in terms of their link to the public health system many of these women are african american women and how can we cut nearly 1 1 billion from the head start program which will effectively knock out 200 000 children from participating in this critical early education program which helps provide health nutritional and support services to prepare children for school many african americans who were part of the head start program are now making history in our country because of this great early childhood education program the other side has made it clear that no matter who is impacted by these cutswomen infants children the working poor people of color african americanstheir response consists of only three words so be it so be it if 800 000 jobs are lost so be it if people are put out on the street with no access to homeless assistance grants or temporary housing so be it if people dont get enough nutritional support or if kids have to go hungry so be it that is not what the civil rights movement was about we should be working together to build up a nation instead of tear down the very programs and institutions that have contributed to our nations growth and success we should be working together to reduce inequality help the unemployed and get our economy moving again above all we should be working to create jobs thats what so many prominent african american leaders have fought for over the yearsfrom those who are well known the world over like dr martin luther king jr to people who are sometimes well known just in their own neighborhood tonight there is one person i want to mention who influenced my life and the direction i took our late beloved former congresswoman shirley anita chisholm in 1968 congresswoman shirley chisholm was the first african american woman elected to congress and she was a founding member of the congressional black caucus we celebrate this year 40 years of this great institution in our congress the conscience of the congress it is the 42nd anniversary of the election of congresswoman chisholm who represented her brooklynbased congressional district with grace and distinction for 14 years earning a reputation as one of the houses most eloquent orators and greatest champions of human rights social and economic justice in 1972 congresswoman chisholm again made history when she became the first african american to run for the presidential nomination of a major party that campaign captured the imagination of millions and inspired countless individuals to engage in the political process for the first time and i know for a fact that congresswoman shirley chisholm paved the way for our great president obama to be able to win the presidency 2 years ago congresswoman chisholm was a catalyst for change giving voice to the overlooked and underrepresented members of our society people of color women children and the african american community and she fought for the unemployed she fought for those who wanted to work for those who were seeking the american dream i cant help but wonder what she would say right now if she knew this was taking place im sure she does know this is taking place and i can feel her telling us that we have to fight the good fight because her legacy is so important within the context of creating jobs that we are trying to do for our country later this week i will be introducing two pieces of legislation to honor the work of congresswoman shirley chisholm the first would recognize and celebrate the 42nd anniversary of her election to congress and the second would call on the postal service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring the life and accomplishments of congresswoman chisholm i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support these bills as we work to finalize funding for the 2011 fiscal year let us remember that budgets are moral documents and as congresswoman chisholm said when morality comes up against profit it is seldom that profit loses so we have to stand up for morality reverend jim wallis and sojourners challenged us they asked us what would jesus cut programs to help the poor or wasteful weapons systems at the pentagon ending the war in afghanistan or programs to feed and shelter the poor this weekend once again i will be participating in the faith and politics civil rights pilgrimage we are going to selma montgomery and birmingham alabama the epicenter of the civil rights movement we will be led by our hero a warrior a great civil rights leader our colleague congressman john lewis who sacrificed so much for civil and human rights and economic justice i have participated in this pilgrimage many times and i always feel a sense of gratitude to congressman lewis and to rosa parks and to dr king to shirley chisholm to all of those who fought so hard for equality and jobs and freedom this year however i feel that many of these gains mind you that all of our great civil rights leaders fought for are about to be eroded due to the increasing income inequality and the reckless budget cuts which will gut so much in

take a few minutes to talk about the future last december when faced with the prospect that tax rates for the richest 2 percent of americans would rise to where they were in the 1990s when we balanced the budget and enjoyed unprecedented prosperity republicans decided that extending these unnecessary and unaffordable tax cuts was their number one priority as we all remember they held muchneeded relief to the middle class hostage and they got their tax cut for millionaires and billionaires according to the joint committee on taxation this tax is adding 39 billion to the deficit this year and will add even more next year speaker boehner has said that our national debt is a moral issue and i agree with him we need to act to curb our exploding deficits and mounting debt but republicans and democrats have different approaches to the problem the republicans approach is the irresponsible continuing resolution that was passed by this house 10 days ago republicans would cut 600 million from the cops program and 256 million from the state and local law enforcement assistance program which would make our streets less safe republicans would cut 75 million from the legal services corporation which would deny legal services to the victims of domestic violence republicans would cut 53 million from the food safety and inspection service which would threaten public health republicans would completely eliminate family planning funding which would result in more unplanned pregnancies and more abortions adding insult to injury republicans would cut 758 million from women infants and children which would deny these mothers and children the nutrition they need to begin life on the right track republicans would cut pell grants by 15 percent which would deny young people the opportunity to get a college education i could go on but i think you get my point the cuts in the republican continuing resolution are shortsighted counterproductive and the wrong way to cut the deficit and the one community or the communities that will suffer the most are minority communities in this country and that includes the black communities black students black mothers and black infants as well mark zandi the former economic adviser to the mccain campaign said that these cuts will destroy 700 000 jobs and stall our economic recovery which would lessen future revenues and further exacerbate the debt problem and a goldman sachs economist warned that the republican plan could reduce our nations economic growth by 1 5 to 2 percent in the second and third quarters of this year maybe i should amend my previous statement the cuts in the republican cr are shortsighted counterproductive and may not even cut the deficit we need a smarter approach we need an approach of shared sacrifice not sacrifice by the most vulnerable we do need to cut the deficit but there are different ways to cut the deficit and i believe the republicans have chosen the wrong way democrats offer a better approach we can cut the deficit by at least 61 billion in such a manner that helps doesnt hurt struggling americans our economy and our shared future first as i mentioned before we need to get rid of once and for all the tax cuts for the richest 2 percent of americans it is too late to save the 39 billion that we wasted this year but we could save more than that next year next i think we need to get rid of special tax preferences for oil and gas companies many of which were instituted by republicans the last time they were in the majority this would save 44 billion over the next 10 years there is no good reason to keep these subsidies in place the oil companies have said themselves that they dont need them john hofmeister the former ceo of shell oil said on february 11 in the face of sustained high oil prices it was not an issuefor large companiesof needing the subsidies to entice us into looking for and producing more oil next defense secretary gates has called for 78 billion in defense cuts over the next 5 years saying that these funds can be cut without putting national security at risk we should listen to him i want to thank my friend from the virgin islands

southwest washington its a tremendous place its where i grew up some of my fondest memories are in and around southwest washington whether it was lakes or rivers or streams or working my first job at the vancouver mall its not even called the vancouver mall anymore i had a lot of opportunitiesa lot of opportunities that i am very worried the next generation of washingtonians are not going to have and let me tell you why our unemployment has been over double digits going on 3 years now let me read this to you because this is important these arent just empty numbers these represent families and lives clark county 10 2 percent cowlitz county 11 9 percent lewis county 13 2 percent pacific county 12 5 percent wahkiakum 11 8 percent skamania 12 9 percent and thurston county is at 8 percent let me compare those numbers quickly im not happy about 8 percent im not happy about 13 percent but theres a slight difference in the reason that the thurston county numbers are lower than the other counties and thats because thats where the state government is housed so there are more government jobs more public sector jobs in that area but the rest of the district and even in thurston county is based on small businesses these are the hearts and souls of our economy small business owners entrepreneurs momandpop shops i got to tour somarakis vacuum pumps he is an engineer that started a small little company built it up hes passing it on to his son hes now expanded into two counties he has a vision to grow and hire people in fact he has been able to stay afloat these last few years because a lot of the trade that hes done he deals with other corporations and other countries across the world which is one of the reasons hes been able to remain competitive you know what he told me this last week when i was home and i was touring his new facility he said jaimei wish i could give you his greek accent but i canthe said jaime im a proud american i built this company because i believe in the entrepreneurial spirit of america i believe in this country but you in washington d c and hes speaking to the governing class hereare making it harder for me to function youre making it harder for me to survive the unpredictability the high taxes the new energy proposals some of which the president has supported he said jaime if that capandtrade bill went into effect or if you increase my energy taxes through the epa i will be out of business i will not be able to hire the next generation of engineers and pass this company on and other small businesses around our whole region and around our nation are saying the same thing can you give us some predictability quit raising our taxes get the epa off our backs we all want to protect our way of life but whats happening right now is small business owners the job creators are being squeezed and why i was reflecting on its true neither the senate nor the president has put forward a really strong governing jobs agenda this year when we got to meet with the president a couple of weeks ago he pointed to some of the bills that they passed last year and some of the plans if i reflect on the 700 billionplus bailout or the 800 billion stimulus or the health care bill that was over a trillion dollars one would think if we spent that kind of money we would have the jobs to show for it but where are the jobs i just read you the unemployment numbers for southwest washington state they have actually not gone up in tremendous rise so clearly borrowing and spending more has at the very least a negligible effect we can do better we have to do better the way we do thatstop bailing out big corporations banks auto dealers right stop spending more money fast fact i had some job creators in my office a couple of weeks ago and they were asking for more investment and i asked them about the stimulusthe 800 billion stimulus bill that the president and the democrats here voted on and passed last yearhow much that had actually stimulated job creation you know what they told me less than 3 percent of that number actually went to build roads remember the shovelready hurrah that was talked about were passing this because were going to build infrastructure im one of those who believes infrastructure is important less than 3 5 percent was actually used to build roads where is the rest of that money my goodness we borrowed almost half of that were going to pass the interest and the debt on to the next generation and yet we didnt even use it on what we said we were going to use it on that tells me that were spending too much were borrowing too much its time to cut back every family in southwest washington and across this nation has cut their own budget back in recent years every small business owner job creators they will tell youi have several in my area who havent even taken a paycheck in several years in order that they not lay anyone else off and theyre looking at us saying why cant you live within your means well guess what were going to not only are we going to make sensible cuts and reductions were also going to stimulate job growth energy was one of the things i mentioned in the last couple of months we have passed off this house floor several bills that allow us to drill for energy here in america using american entrepreneurialism american innovation and creating american jobs i call on our senate to pass those bills and the president to sign them into law theyre saying thousands and thousands of jobs could be created here in america if we simply take advantage of the resources in our backyards that will do several things it will drive down the cost of gas which is going to hit every family and every small business here in the next several months thats one immediate step we can take in addition to cutting back overspending thats a jobs production bill we could also make sure that we allow for some predictability with these federal regulations that are coming out small business owners call me regularly and say good grief i just barely get one rule under order and youre sending me five new ones i cant keep up here is the difference small businesses small business owners they cant just hire someone who is not being productive and just dedicate that persons time to going through federal regulations maybe a big corporation could one which can retain lots of lobbyists or lawyers but at the true value hardware on main street in ridgefield both the owners actually work the store so they cant just waste money to jump through government regulations and government hoops it has got to stop last year the epa released 900 new regulations900 do you know what the epa acting director for the water department told us on the transportation committee just 2 or 3 months ago she basically said she didnt have to take into account any of those regulations and their impact on our economy that wasnt her concern im sorry since when does the government put forward regulations and rules and then say we dont have any concern for what thats going to do to the economy thats why were in the mess were in now we can change it we can take some steps to bring oversight to these regulatory agencies man theyre just going crazy were going to work to streamline those and were going to do it now because house republicans believe and understand that job creators and job growth occur in the private sector when individuals and entrepreneurs have the freedom to grow and to develop not when theyre hampered not when their wrists are tied not when theyre told you have to jump through these hoops just to sell your product or just to hire someone it has got to stop which is why were putting forward and why house republicans are proud to put forward bills that are either going to pull back some of these regulations or streamline them reform them or allow for more american job growth here in the united states so i appreciate that and i look forward to

"i thank my friend from the third district of arkansas and appreciate his comments here tonight id like to continue a little bit tonight talking about tax reform since representative womack was talking about some aspects of the presidents proposal i think most of us around here are certainly excited that the president has even started discussing fundamental tax reform unfortunately i think that the presidents proposal has a lot of aspects that would be burdensome to the businesses and the job creators that he purports to be trying to help and so i dont think that it has much chance in the house or the senate and i think he knew that when he proposed it but at least he is having that conversation thats a start thats a start as we talked about whether you are talking about tax reform energy exploration regulatory reform our commonsense budgeting making the federal government live within its means all of those relate to jobs they all are directly related to encouraging private sector job creation weve been working on a highway bill recently infrastructure is a critical part of this equation thats part of the spending our money wisely under the budgeting side of things because we need a strong infrastructure so that we can compete with other countries continue to have economic development in this country so thats a critical part of it but with regard to the presidents tax plan it raises taxes at least a dollar for every dollar in tax cuts that he provides to simplify the corporate tax code it creates a whole new category of taxes for our companies that do business overseas and most glaringly it doesnt do anything to address individual tax rates the tax rates that you pay at home i pay and why is that important for job creation well for a number of reasons first of all the code we have now is complex it doesnt always reward hard work in fact sometimes it punishes it but one of the real specific reasons why we must deal with the individual tax rates to grow jobs is because many businesses pay their taxes particularly llcs sole proprietorships partnerships mom and pop businesses all around the country in arkansas and in my district they pay their taxes using the individual income tax brackets so you cant just address corporate tax code although the presidents corporate tax reform has got a lot of tax hikes in it that will make our businesses our job creators in this country less competitive but you cant just reform the tax code by dealing with corporate tax reform youve got to look at individual tax reform corporate tax reform across the board you have to make it simpler fairer and flatter some of the terms that weve talked about weve certainly advocated for that in our budget last year and we are going to do it again this year its critical not only for job creation by larger businesses but by small business mom and pop businesses so tax reform is a critical part of what we need to do to get jobs going as ive talked about earlier some of my colleagues talked about there are a number of reforms that we have been pursuing for over a year now that relate directly to private sector job creation as i indicated earlier its tax reform its regulatory reform its more energy development its living within our means individually these issues may not have jobs in the title but they are the columns the supports that hold up the private sector job building if you will i want to say a couple of things about the regulatory issue because ive just introduced a bill h r 4078 regulatory freeze for jobs act again as a lot of us said im not antiregulation i dont know anyone thats against regulations across the board what im against is the federal government failing to apply common sense when regulating what im against are excessive regulations overly burdensome regulations ill give you an example i had a jobs conference down in my district in little rock at the clinton presidential library we had a jobs conference we invited a number of job creators it seems to me if you want to know what to do to create private sector jobs or encourage private sector job creation youd ask someone who had actually created them folks from the private sector experts on this issue we invited them in and said hey whats the biggest obstacle to job creation we had democrats and republicans both and we asked them just point blank and the number one answer was regulatory uncertainty what does that mean well it means that folks have money that they might want to invest but they hold on tight to that money because theyre not quite sure whats going to happen theyre not sure whether were going to get our debt under control or not theyre not sure how much obamacare the presidents health care law is going to cost them theyre not sure whether the regulations that theyve heard proposed by the epa as potentially being proposed theyre not sure whether those are going to be implemented or not its just uncertainty everywhere and i had someone say to me the other night well theres always uncertainty yes there is always uncertainty if youre a farmer theres uncertainty whether there will be enough rain for the crops that year there will always be some uncertainty in life because we dont have crystal balls i get that but what we dont want is a federal government that needlessly creates additional uncertainty you know sometimes we say i had enough problems before this came along well thats what were talking about you have enough to deal with naturally you have enough uncertainty as it is you dont need the federal government creating more uncertainty if you talk to community banks who have been impacted by the presidents doddfrank law theyve got a lot of uncertainty theyre having to hire new folks to comply with the law what are the new regulations going to be we dont know yet just know theyre coming dont know what theyre going to be yet just know theyre coming and theyre going to be burdensome the same with the health care law heres a quote from actually a wellknown democrat businessman commissioner on the arkansas highway commission appointed by our democrat governor in arkansas former chairman of the arkansas economic development commission john burkhalter he said at my jobs conference every project i look at now ive got to wonder if im going to get to build it because are the regulations going to stop me ive got to admit that i pass on over 50 percent of the projects that i would like to do because of the burden the hurdle of the regulations now the president recently said in his state of the union address that he has approved fewer regulations in the first 3 years of his presidency than his republican predecessor did in his well the president said that sitting right here on the floor of the house during the state of the union this year so i think it deserves some attention well is that true if you just look at the numbers its true if you just look at the number of regulations but if you look at the number of what are called major regulations and the burden that it puts the cost of the regulations what this president has done far exceeds what weve seen before the previous administration issued an average of 63 major regulations per year this administration has issued an average of 88 an increase of 40 percent under president bush the office of information and regulatory affairs reviewed an average of 77 economically significant regulations biennially these are the ones that really impact business im not talking about a minor regulation here or there were talking about the ones that really impact job creators under president bush his office of regulatory affairs reviewed about 77 every 2 years under this president its 125 not quite doubled but not far from it if the administration maintains its current pace it would add nearly 150 billion annually in new regulatory costs over 8 years im going to yield to my friend from virginia but before i do i just want to mention that i have proposed the regulatory freeze for jobs act h r 4078 what it would do it would basically freeze the introduction and progression of major regulations those having an impact of 100 billion or more it would freeze those with exceptions for emergencies health issues what have you there are exceptions in the bill but it would freeze them until our unemployment rate gets down to 6 percent to show that were getting our footing because what the regulatory environment is doing to our job creators is stifling their ability to create jobs im going to yield now to my

philip verleger that is why transcanada wants to build this pipeline my amendment simply requires the secretary of energy to analyze the effect of the proposed pipeline on increased gas prices for american consumers and to determine if this pipeline is just an effort to manipulate the market for crude oil in the united states the proposed pipeline would carry up to 900 000 barrels per day of tar sands oil from alberta canada over 2 000 miles to refineries on the unitedstates gulf coast proponents have claimed that it would bring down oil prices however transcanadas permit application to the canadian government for the pipeline included documents and testimony which said canadian oil companies could use the pipeline to increase americas fuel bill by up to 4 billion per year by limiting the supply of canadian crude to midwest refineries and rerouting it to gulf coast refineries this benefit to canadian oil companies was used by transcanada to argue that approval of the pipeline was in canadas interest but this information was conveniently hidden when transcanada applied for the unitedstates presidential permit from the state department this information comes from a report by international energy consultant purvin and gertz inc the company that transcanada hired to evaluate its keystone xl pipeline in section 3 4 3 of their report they concluded that there was an oversupply of crude oil in the midwest that resulted in lower prices for canadian crude oil and that the keystone xl pipeline would remove this oversupply and raise crude oil prices in the market in section 3 4 5 of their report they recite that keystone has reviewed the pgi assessment and agrees with its conclusions through manipulation of unitedstates oil markets the keystone xl pipeline will

community leaders on the issue after seeing this bridge for myself and after listening carefully to the arguments on all sides i am convinced that this legislation is necessary reasonable and timesensitive the bridge project will support thousands of construction jobs in both wisconsin and minnesota in addition the new bridge will help shorten travel times reduce traffic congestion and most importantly improve safety perhaps it will even save some lives the stories ive heard from the wisconsinites who use this bridge every day are truly startling ive heard from some folks who literally fear for their safety and who are afraid something similar to the 135 bridge collapse could happen to them ive heard from others about the long delays and frequent spring closures of the bridge this is the reality on the ground and it is woefully unacceptable we have the power to change this i urge my colleagues to vote yes and to support this bipartisan legislation"],

gridlock for a long period of time where the senate cant get 60 votesthat were not going to go anywhere from the offer that hes made to pass something that can in fact garner 60 votes in the senate i regret that the senate frankly didnt get 60 votes for our offer and he is correct that he got a few more votes for h r 1 than was gotten for the senate majority leaders counteroffer but the fact of the matter is this is really an issue between the republicans and the democrats senator mcconnell has said as i know the majority leader says well pass what the house passes thats what he said now if thats the case then we need to pass something that can garner 60 votes over there we know that h r 1 couldnt get 60 votes we know that senator reids proposal couldnt get 60 votes and if were going to move this government forward and not fund it on 2week cyclesand senator mccain has said that funding the defense department on 2week or 3week cycles is undermining our national security so there is no disagreement that doing things 2 weeks at a time does not make sense and if the gentlemans view is simply you will not make some offer that we thinkand we can have a discussion about trying to come to agreement on thatthat we can get 60 votes for in the senate and were going to fund it on 2week cycles i say to my friend thats going to be damaging to the economy create great uncertainty and undermine our national security and i would hope that the gentleman would see fit to determine where we can meet somewhere in the middle we think weve come 51 percent of the way towards your hundred towards your hundred you keep talking about 60 that was not your pledge your pledge was 100 and the way you got to 100 was to count the 41 weve done that weve done another 10 so weve come we think 51 percent of the way you dont count it that way and we understand that but whatever way we come we need to move on you won the majority god bless you im sorry about that but i live with it and there it is you have the majority and with the majority you have the responsibility to see if we can move this country forward thats what newt gingrich said and you cant be the perfectionist caucus as he referred to of sticking just at a number that doesnt have the votes in the united states senate and if were going to be on this 2week cycle i will tell my friend you may keep passing these 2 weeks at a time none of us want to shut down government but i will tell you that while i and my colleagues some of my colleagues may vote to do this one more time for me its the last time we need to have a plan to fund this government for the balance of the fiscal year to september 30 it is irresponsible for us not to have that and just each of us sticking to our number you sticking to your number and

valley improvement act 800 000 acre feet of water was dedicated to the environment and it was not temporary it was part of what was to be done into the future and the negotiations that ensued following the accord in 1994 those negotiations were specifically designed to reach an accommodation on how to meet all of the requirements of the central valley improvement act including what to do with the 800 000 acre feet i would point out to the opponents of this amendment that the accord the 1994 baydelta accord was never intended to be permanent it had in fact a 3year limitation which led

from the table when everybody else was ready to sign and we have been involved in this imbroglio ever since now the 800 000 acre feet is indeed taken away from the environment no matter how you spin

of a specified set of mortgages one of the fundamental principles of germaneness is that the amendment must confine itself to the jurisdiction of the committees represented in the underlying bill the

time as i may consume id like to thank the sponsor of the legislation the senator from new jersey and the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee ms roslehtinen for their leadership on this issue this resolution expresses the sense of congress that taiwan should be accorded observer status in the international civil aviation organization icao taiwan has made significant progress in its economic and political development today taiwan is a leading trade partner of the united states and stands as a beacon of democracy in asia however taiwan has been excluded from meaningful participation in icao an international organization which is dedicated to ensuring safe and efficient air transportation around the globe taiwan clearly deserves to be brought into icao as an observera status specifically recognized under icaos own rules taiwan has jurisdiction over airspace comprising 176 000 square nautical miles and provides air traffic control services to over 1 3 million flights each year it has the eighth largest airport in the world by cargo volume and the 18th largest by the number of international passengers taiwans exclusion from icao has impeded taiwans efforts to maintain civil aviation standards to keep up with rapidly evolving international standards it is unable to even contact icao for uptodate information on aviation standards and norms nor can it receive icaos technical assistance implementing new regulations or participate in icao technical and academic seminars despite these impediments taiwan has made every effort to comply with icaos standards but their continued exclusion not only hurts taiwan it puts the entire international aviation system at risk indeed taiwans exclusion has prevented icao from developing a truly global strategy to address security threats with this resolution congress calls on the international community to grant taiwan observer status at icao not only to help taiwan but to ensure icao can fulfill its own mission and address international threats to aviation security we call on the united states government to take the leading role at icao to assist taiwan in gaining that status and look forward to working with our administration officials to track the development of these efforts i urge my colleagues to support the resolution and i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
