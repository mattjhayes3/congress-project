vast majority of our constituents want us to do something about preventing more gun violence in this country mass shootings have become unacceptably commonplace in the united states of america and we have a responsibility to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands the shooting in orlando was the largest mass shooting in our countrys history this is a moment of truth and we cannot have another moment of silence without some action we are pleading with the speaker of the house and we are pleading with our republican colleagues to allow us to bring two bipartisan bills to the floor for consideration so that we can debate them and vote on them one is the no fly no buy legislation if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane because you are on the terrorist watch list according to the fbi then you are too dangerous to buy a gun it shouldnt be controversial the second is to eliminate the loopholes in our background check system which says that you have to go through a background check if you go to a licensed gun dealer but that you can get around that by going to a gun show or by buying a gun online overwhelming numbers of democrats and republicans according to the latest public opinion polls think both of these ideas are smart commonsense approaches the only thing that is standing in the way is the republican leadership in this house please schedule these bills for a vote no we will not be satisfied with the nra bill that you want to bring to the floor this week that basically is nothing but a press release but will not keep guns out of the hands of people who are suspected of being terrorists i hope that we can reach some sort of accomodation with our republican friends we are not going away this issue is too important and it is about time we acted silence and

muster the courage to hold a vote on two proposals that are supported by roughly 90 percent of this country and that can save american lives the american people deserve to be heard they deserve a vote if the unitedstates homeland security community places a person on the fbi terrorist watch list or determines that a person is too dangerous to board an airplane then surely we can agree that person is too dangerous to buy a firearm this week the majority will introduce a bill that pretends to close this gap in our homeland security laws but in reality it would create a system in which it is both legal and likely for suspected terrorists to buy a firearm the republican measure takes no fly no buy and turns it into no fly no problem under their proposal if a known or suspected terrorist attempts to buy a weapon they will be denied that ability for a mere 3 days from the moment they attempt to purchase that firearm the following things must happen all within 72 hours to prevent that purchase the attorney general must file a petition in federal court the court must schedule a hearing the suspect must be provided actual notice and the opportunity to appear at that hearing with a lawyer the court must rule on the petition and if all those things do not occur in 3 days the suspect is legally entitled to buy a weapon not only does the republican bill set an impossible timeline it also requires the justice department to meet an extremely high burden of proof a sale would only be prevented if the court finds probable cause that the suspect has committed or will commit an act of terrorism the republican proposal is specifically designed to ensure the justice department fails and the suspect is allowed to buy a gun it is a fig leaf to cover up the republicans refusal to take any meaningful action on gun violence it is no surprise that this bill is supported by the gun lobby instead of spending our time on toothless ineffective proposals we should vote on the original no fly no buy bill that will keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists we are also demanding a vote on a bipartisan proposal to require that commercial gun purchases include a background check background checks for all i have yet to hear one good explanation on why this should not be the law of the land if a dangerous person cannot pass a background check at a licensed gun dealer they

white house the american people saw what liberals would pass when given free rein and a blank check with doddfrank democrats deemed it necessary to punish small community banks with burdensome regulations they cannot afford to comply with doddfrank created a new unaccountable bureaucracy called the cfpb which is funded in a way that obscures its transparency and prevents congress direct oversight of the agency the lack of accountability like that seen with the cfpb and the heavy hand of agencies like the epa and the irs have become hallmarks of this administration with the stimulus bill democrats gave handouts to their union and socalled green energy friends taxpayers were on the hook for loan guarantees to companies like solyndra which used its political connections in the white house to push through irresponsible loan approvals when solyndra went bankrupt it was at the cost of the american people many other smaller boondoggles came out of the stimulus silly studies on ducks over 1 million on road signs that promote the stimulus and over 3 million for a tunnel for turtles in florida this leaves obamacare too many americans have felt the negative consequences of what boils down to a government takeover of the healthcare industry the president claimed this law would decrease premiums by 2 500 per year instead they have risen since obamacare has been enacted to go with the increase in cost many americans have seen a sharp decrease in their choices there are fewer plans available restricting the ability of hardworking families to choose coverage that is appropriate for their circumstances taken together this trio of liberal policies is adding layers of bureaucratic red tape forcing americans to pay more for health care and putting taxpayers on the hook in 2009 democrats used the blank check to add 1 5 trillion in discretionary spending when republicans gained control of the house of representatives in 2011 we put discretionary spending on a downward trend discretionary spending funds our federal agencies such as the epa and the irs as well as the department of defense we have made real cuts in spending not slowdowns in growth and not projected cuts down the roadhonesttogod cuts in spending since i took office in 2011 discretionary spending has been cut significantly by 434 billion but this does not address mandatory spending which is the real driver of our national debt this includes programs like food assistance welfare medicare medicaid social security and interest on our debt reforms are needed to ensure these programs work efficiently and are sustainable because of the way obamacare was written and enacted mandatory spending also includes large portions of obamacare funding mandatory spending is on autopilot and will continue with or without congress annual appropriations process the fact is we have to change the law that means both chambers of congress have to pass reforms and the president has to sign them or we have to override a veto mandatory spending accounts for threequarters of all money spent by the federal government this is a 180degree change from when i was a teenager when in 1970 mandatory spending was only about a third of government spending realistically there is only one path to a balanced budget and shrinking our national debt that path is to pass a budget and use a process called reconciliation a budget facilitates reconciliation which only requires a 51vote majority in the united states senate and avoids a filibuster by liberals who want to continue running up americas credit

the guns of their choosingand they can do it legally since 2004 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists were able to purchase guns more than 90 percent of all suspected terrorists who tried to purchase guns in the last 11 years walked away with the weapon that they went in to buy now in the wake of the horrific attacks in orlando congress must make it a priority to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of suspected terrorists there is bipartisan legislation that would prohibit those on the terrorist watch list from being able to purchase firearms in our country this bill is common sense if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun it is long past time for the republican leadership to bring that bill up for a vote we also need to pass my bipartisan bill to require

expelled african american students are arrested far more often than their white classmates black and hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in schoolrelated arrests or referrals to law enforcement currently african americans make up twofifths and hispanics onefifth of confined youth today disparities are found not only in how we punish behavior in schools but also how we fund education this is true in k12 it is also true in higher education and we know that a college degree is a path to a middle class life as african american students graduate with more debt than their white classmates the cuts to pell grants are threatening african american access to a better education without the pell grant program hundreds of thousands of young african americans would

floor to protest the inaction of this republican congress the tyranny of the majority to act on gun violence prevention measurestheir deliberate inaction in the face of 33 000 deaths caused by gun violence every year we came to demand substantive action to address our countrys epidemic of gun violence yet today we will be presented with legislation promoted by the nra that fails to address this serious problem h r 4237 does not close or otherwise address the terror gap that allows known or suspected terrorists in the united states to legally buy guns instead this bill handicaps law enforcement creating an impossibly burdensome process and allowing terrorists to take advantage of the charleston loophole in fact h r 4237 doesnt just leave the loophole open which led to the loss of nine lives at the emanuel ame church it reinforces it and the terror gap under this legislation to prevent the transfer of a firearm the government will be required to file an emergency petition schedule a hearing provide the suspect with notice and counsel and win the hearing all within 72 hours of the attempted purchase and even if the government is able to win the hearing it can only prevent the transfer if the court finds that the suspected terrorist committed attempted to or will commit an act of terrorism put another way the government can only prevent a gun sale to a suspected terrorist if they can arrest the person for terrorist activity within 3 days of an attempted purchase ultimately this legislation does not provide any meaningful safeguards to prevent terrorists from purchasing guns sadly it is nothing more than a political tactic to avoid responsibility a contrived effort to look busy and feign concern while thousands of americans lose their lives to gun violence the american people are smarter than this we have a moral responsibility to do something meaningful the american people demand that we do more that we do something that we do anything to help prevent another mass tragedy in this country make no mistake this legislation falls short of a goodfaith effort to save lives the gao found that individuals on the terrorist watch list were able to pass a background check and legally purchase a firearm 2 043 times between february of 2004 and december of 2014 the fbi was only able to prevent 10 percent of these purchases as we all unfortunately learned on june 12 when we fail to prevent dangerous individuals from getting their hands on guns we put the lives of americans at risk but there is legislation that the house can consider that will reduce gun violence first h r 1076 the no fly no buy bill would effectively close the terror gap by providing the department of justice with the discretion to block gun sales to terrorist suspects it will preserve due process for individuals who were mistakenly listed to appeal their denial second h r 1217 would implement universal background checks for all commercial gun sales it is a measure supported by the overwhelming majority of the american people and empirical research shows that universal background checks for all handgun sales have lowered levels of gun violence in those states where that occurs nationally 34 percent of gun sales and 40 percent of all gun transfers occur without a background check this legislation would represent an important step toward closing this loophole and reducing gun violence i urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to bring these two bills to the floor to respond to the demands of the american people to do something about the pandemic of gun violence to do something meaningful that will actually reduce gun violence in this country and protect the american people as we are sworn to do i know i speak for all of my colleagues

first 6 weeks of the 114th congress sadly this has become the standard operating procedure in the republican house in 2011 when republicans took the majority speaker boehner promised the right to a robust debate in open process he promised many open rules instead we have just ended the most closed congress in history and if these past 6 weeks are any indication of where we are headed this leadership seems intent on breaking its own record for denying open debate on the house floor i also want to point out that the department of homeland security runs out of money february 28 16 days from now press reports indicate that the republican leadership is scrambling to gather the votes necessary to pass a bill well i have some advice for my friends in the majority instead of yelling instead of pouting and swearing bring to the floor a clean department of homeland security appropriations bill the bipartisan negotiated compromise that has been ready to go since last november this is a bill that could and should be sent to the president as quickly as possible especially considering the international and national homeland security situation facing the unitedstates and the world at this very very moment so i have to say that i am a little perplexed as to why the majority has chosen this week to bring to the floor a package of tax breaks that are not paid for that are going nowhere 5 legislative days before the department of homeland security is going to be forced to shut down because of republican dithering and i say going nowhere because senate republicans have said quite clearly that these bills will not likely be considered in committee or by the full senate let me repeat that these bills are going nowhere because of the republicans in the senate they have made it pretty clear so the clock is ticking on funding our homeland security programs are the republican leaders planning to let the clock run out planning to create another crisis we should be debating a clean department of homeland security bill right now we ought to vote in a bipartisan way to pass it have the senate do the same thing send it right to the president and actually accomplish something i am also concerned with the partisan approach taken by the republicans on the ways and means committee in advancing these particular tax measures we went through this same exercise last year with a similar set of bills only to pass in the final weeks of the 113th congress a 1year comprehensive tax extenders package the republican leadership in the house is setting the stage for a similar confrontation this year instead of working in a productive and bipartisan manner on comprehensive tax reform that is something that the american people democrats and republicans all want they want us to be working on it and they want us to pass a bipartisan comprehensive tax reform bill the seven tax provisions before us today packaged into two bills will add more than 93 billion to the deficit there was a time when my republican friends actually cared about the deficit i guess those days are gone while i support the goals of many of the provisions contained in these bills i cannot vote for legislation that targets only a handful of tax provisions chooses to elevate them and make them permanent at the expense of other tax priorities and then refuses to pay for themabsolutely refuses to pay for them this republican package does nothing absolutely nothing to address key priorities like the work opportunity tax credit and the new markets tax credit it fails to address the longterm status of the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit that work to reduce poverty if these tax provisions are allowed to expire in 2017 as currently scheduled many working poor families would lose their child tax credit and many lowincome married couples and larger families would see a cut in their eitc the center on budget and policy priorities estimates that if the eitc and the ctc provisions were to expire more than 16 million people in lowincome working families including 8 million children would fall intoor deeper intopoverty the piecemeal deficitspending approach taken by this majority puts these working family tax provisions at risk i was pleased to see members of the republican leadership at d c central kitchen the other day talking about hunger d c central kitchen does incredible work to feed the hungry and help people get back on their feet but count me as a little skeptical because time after time after time after time republicans have targeted poor people and the programs that help them if my friends on the other side of the aisle are serious about ending hunger they need to do much more than encourage donations to food banks first and foremost they should stop targeting snap the nations premier antihunger program they should stop treating snap as an atm machine for other programs instead they should work with us to increase the minimum wage or at least give us a vote on increasing the minimum wage they should work with us to expand job training programs and make child care more affordable they should work with us to fix the major flaw in our social safety net namely that when someone gets a job that doesnt pay very much they tend to lose all their benefits and end up struggling once again to put food on the table find day care for their kids keep their house warm and pay the rent we need desperately to have a serious and thoughtful discussion about the longterm sustainability of our safety net programs the fighting hunger incentive act makes permanent the enhanced deduction for contributions of food inventory i strongly support our food banks and charitable organizations that work each and every day to feed the hungry in this country i support efforts that provide incentives to donate food to these organizations but one tax break does not constitute a plan to address hunger and it certainly does not make up for the cuts to snap and other safety net programs that have been proposed and enacted by this republican majority so in closing again i would urge my colleagues to pay attention to todays national journal daily the headline so far a congress about nothing that is what this congress is becoming known as a congress about nothing well work with us in a bipartisan way to change this headline and you could do that by allowing a clean department of homeland security appropriations bill to come before us we can pass it in a bipartisan way and we can meet the national security needs of our country and

rise to offer an amendment that will facilitate health screenings in communities coping with groundwater contamination from nearby defense installations my amendment dedicates 7 million in the operations and maintenance defensewide account to screenings for residents who unbeknownst to them have fallen victim to exposure to firefighting chemicals which have bled into the drinking water one of those sites where this has happened for over a couple of decades is in my district a district i share with the gentleman from philadelphia mr brendan f boyle the navy air station in montgomery county and mr fitzpatrick of bucks county in warminster the navy has been working very closely with the epa and the public water authorities to take wells off line to address contamination and to provide public drinking water but one of the things that they have not done is levels of screening to determine whether there has been any impact associated with the presence of what we call pfoas something the epa has determined levels at which it may create a potential risk make no mistake about it the federal government is responsible for this that will not be an issue which will be contested so the question is whether there is precedent for the ability to work on something like this allowing the navy and the answer is yes this has happened private entities in both hoosick new york and west virginia have worked through state authorities to enable there to be testing of thousands of local residents in situations like this to determine whether or not there could have been any local impact due to that so we are not asking the defense department to put any kind of man hours into this we are asking them to work with what we believe are appropriate authorities that already exist and for them to work in publicprivate partnerships with state entities to enable and facilitate some of this testing to take place i think the navy deserves credit for being proactive in the way they have looked at this issue but we see this as a continuing obligation and would like to see the navy fulfill the support to enable this important important testing to take place i want to thank chairman frelinghuysen for putting important language in the appropriations bill that includes report language requiring the pentagon to report on what sites pose a potential health risk and its plan

that we need to take a serious look at the choice program vas most recent data show compared to the last year there are now 70 000 more appointments that kept a veteran waiting at least a month to get care furthermore a march general accounting office report showed that the choice program had little impact on getting veterans to see a primary care physician in 30 days thousands of veterans referred to the program are returning to the va for care sometimes because the program could not find a doctor for them and because the private doctor they were told to see was too far away according to va data in fact vas own inspector general found that in colorado veterans were waiting longer than 30 days for care because staff at the local va hospital was not adding them to the list of patients eligible for the choice program let alone slow reimbursements two years ago congress was hearing about the va concealing wait times at va hospitals and clinics and about the veterans who were suffering as a result we were forced to act quickly in this crisis i believe that congress will have to revamp the choice program to make sure that it is doing what congress intended for it to do we are going to need an honest assessment from the va i urge all members to support this amendment i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
