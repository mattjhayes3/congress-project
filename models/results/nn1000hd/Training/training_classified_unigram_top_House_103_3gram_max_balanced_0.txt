voters that they were intending to vote for the largest tax increase in unitedstates history i dont think so did they tell the votersthat they would cast their vote to raise taxes dramatically long before ever voting for any spending cuts i dont think so i dont think my colleagues ran as business as usual tax and spend democrats well then let me explain this budget bill the clinton administration is asking freshmen representatives to support its called the omnibus budget reconciliation act the name is purposely confusing so that the american public is deceived into thinking its something harmless or even good i want the american public to know that this now budget bill really is the largest tax increase in american history it will cost american taxpayers at least 332 billion over the next 5 years as a freshman i have a hard time committing american taxpayers to 332 billion as an engineer i always like to quantify figures using basic math lets see how much this tax hike will really mean to the american family my district is one of 435 districts so i took 332 billion and divided it by 435 the result is 760 million per district that means my district in california alone would be obligated to pay 760 million in new taxes over the next 5 years then i took this simple math a step further there are about 570 000 people in my district so i divided 760 million by 570 000 people i was shocked to see that every man woman and child would have to come up with over 1 300 this means that the average family of 5 will be assessed nearly 7 000 in new tax increases let me repeat 7 000 in new tax increases america has never had this huge a tax increase in its entire history but thats not all this tax bill also includes a new btu tax again lets be honest this is a hidden gas tax this btu tax means 8 cents a gallon that might not should like much but it is were told avg 450 yr of new btu taxes per family is not that big a deal to the average american family i guess this is true its only the price of 2 haircuts but this is not all this btu tax is indexed annually for inflation the cost of this new tax will grow higher and higher each year but wait there is more the btu tax isnt just a gas tax on automobiles it also translates into more taxes on electricity water heating oil and almost every other products so by the time all these new taxes are added together i wouldnt be surprised if the total burden to the average family of 5 will exceed 10 000 in new tax increases thats outrageous we must stop this madness the point i raise for my fellow democratic freshmen is that a yes vote on this tax bill will have grave consequences in 1994 good luck going home and telling people that we voted for the biggest tax increase in unitedstates history i just wanted to quantify this bill using simple mathematics so that the american public will be told the truth let me repeat for the average family of five were looking at nearly 10 000 new taxes i say dont raise taxes no nation has ever taxed its way into prosperity cut these hundreds of wasteful government subsides instead"], [0.022342463955283165, 0.022342463955283165, 0, "my amendment is straightforward it simply freezes spending for these programs at the current level under the democrat bill the spending would skyrocket from 388 million this year to 541 million in fiscal year 1994 and 1 billion in fiscal year 1995 my amendment would prevent this profligacy and save the taxpayers 800 million it was just a few short weeks ago that the democrats in this house passed a 5year budget plan which included the largest tax increase in american history we were told then by the democrat majority that this hefty contribution on the part of hard working taxpayers was necessary to reduce the federal budget deficit and here they propose increasing spending on corporate giveaway programs by 158 percent and what does h r 820 do under this bill the federal government is going to build an enormous network of technology centers so bureaucrats can show business men and women what machines to buy and how to run their businesses and the same people who gripe about socalled junk bonds are putting uncle sam in the venture capital business if you thought the s l crisis was bad wait until bureaucrats start making multimilliondollar commercial loans and finally the government is going to spend hundreds of millions each year picking winners and losers in the name of promoting technology here is what we are saying to the taxpayers today the government that brought you amtrak the post office the usda and 500 toilet seats at the pentagon is going to teach real entrepreneurs how to beat international competition the reason this bill is on the floor of course is that the majority believes that committees here in congress and the bureaucrats at the commerce department know how to run the economy as george will noted in a column 2 weeks ago the liberals in washington dc believe they know far more about competing in the marketplace than the undiscerning men and women who have risked their life savings to start a real business in the real world well let us take a look at what the democrat majority has already done for business this year it has heaped another mandate on workers and business in the form of mandated leave legislation it has passed a budget resolution which promises business higher energy and corporate income taxes the majority has promised the business community and the country another 5 years of huge budget deficits which will deprive the private sector access to capital but we have only just begun on the way is striker replacement and the rest of the big labor and trial lawyer agenda which will undermine americas competitiveness the finest illustration of the economic illiteracy of the majority is this the democrat party opposes indexing the capital gains taxwhich lowers the cost of capitalyet supports indexing the minimum wagewhich increases the cost of labor but the democrats are here to help business today they say the party that beleaguers business with higher taxes and regulations at every opportunity now wants to help the majority wants to promote economic growth and jobs through investment sounding ironically like supplyside onservativq republicans but as my friend jude wanniski says the majority is operating on the dark side of the supplyside modelinvesting in government bureaucracies instead of the private sector so as russia sweden mexico france poland and on and onmove away from state planning to emulate the american model of free enterprise the majoritywhile paying lipservice to the market seeks to move more and more resources from the productive private sector to the wasteful public sector if my democrat friends are genuinely interested in creating real jobs in the private sector they should consider this over the last 4 years the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent these small businesses create 76 percent of the new jobs in the economy if you want to help the entrepreneur lower his cost of capital stop tying his hands with unnecessary red and green tape do not raise his energy costs and corporate taxes reform americas legal liability laws amend antiquated antitrust law in short get the government off the backs of small business but do not burden all businesses with massive new taxes and regulations and then give away a billion dollars to the politically wellconnected that will not make america more competitive i would close with a quote from adam smith who warned us of politicians who were onceited enough to try to direct an economy he wrote the statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would net only load himaelf a most unnecessary atten tion but same an authority which could safely be trusted to no council and senate whatever and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it support the armey freeze amendment heed the advice of adam smith save the taxpayers over 3800 million and

being offered today by bill clinton and the democrat majority in congress the budget proposal offered by the democrats is a recipe for economic and fiscal disaster it proposes to increase taxes at a time when americans are already overtaxed it proposes to increase taxes at a itime when we have a fragile economy higher taxes will only stifle job creation and economic growth it proposes to continue the path of excessive govemnment spending excessive spending is the reason our federal government is currently saddled with a massive debt depending on whose estimates you believe bill clinton is proposing to raise taxes anywhere from 250 billion to 315 billion no matter which figure you use if his proposal becomes law it will be the largest tax increase in the history of our nation moreover egardless of the exact figures his proposal taxes everyone from the small business owner to the social security recipient to the working middle income american family and we thought mr clinton was only going to sock it to the rich it is an absolute outrage that a man who actually promised middle american taxpayers a tax cut during the campaign can now turn around and unblushingly pr6pose to raise taxes in a magnitude of historic proportions mr clintons assertion that the reason he must now raise taxes is because the deficit figure is higherthan he anticipated during the campaign is quite frankly bull in fact last july during the campaign clinton predicted even higher deficitsup to 40u billionthan actually materialized moreover democrat budget committee members advising clinton during the campaign and working with their good friends at the congressional budget office certainly were well aware of what to expect in the way of deficit figures most conspicuous among those members is leon panetta former chairman of the housebudget committee and now clintons director of office of management and budget for clinton to rationalize raising taxes based on claims of new deficit figures is the height of hypocrisy this is just another example of mr clinton trying to be slick more importantly regardlessof what the actual deficit figures are t is excessive spending not insufficient tax revenues that has produced our gushing red ink indeed when you combine federal state and local taxes you find that the american taxpayer is already being taxed at alltime record high levels analyzing the federal budget over the past 12 years further drives home thepoint in 1980 revenues to the federal treasury were 500 billion by 1992 revenues had soared to 1 1 trillion a massive 600 billion increase in 12 years in other words in 12 years the american taxpayer shouldered an additional federal tax burden that was greater than the magnitude of the entire tax burden it took us over 200 years to reach one would think that the federal government could do just fine with 600 billion in new tax dollars each year but alas it isnt enough to quench the insatiable thirst of democrats in congress during that same timeframe federal expenditures rose frem 600 billion to nearly 1 4 trillionan increase of 800 billion this simply illustrates the historical fact that for every new dollar the treasury receives in taxes congress spends 1 60 more indeed the 1990 budget deal which had promised spending cuts for every dollar in new taxes instead resulted in congress spending an additional 2 37 for every dollar in new taxes republicans have been willing to make the hard choices and make the spendlng cuts how many times in the past 12 years have i seen this congress on a party ing vote reject republican amendments to trim as little as 1 percent from an appropriation bill how many times have i seen the democratcontrolled rules committee decide to prevent republlcant from offering amendments to cut spending and make economies indeed in that regard i was deeply disappointed that the democrats did not allow my good friend from indiana congressman dan burton to offer his budget freeze proposal i have long been an advocate of an across the board spending freeze mr burrons proposal would have made a bigger dent in the deficit than any of the proposals before us today moreover in my view mr burtons acrosstheboard freeze is the fairest way to spread the burden of spending cutseveryone who benefits from federal spending must tighten the belt however once again in an abuse of their uninterrupted control of the house of representatives for the past 40 years the democrats decided to gag the opposition rather than debate a viable alternative on its merits republicans have proposed viable alternatives and the budget proposal offered by my good fmlend john kasich is the kind of proposal that the american public deserves it proposes no tax increases and will cut the deficit significantly i can only hope that there are democrats in the house that can see the error of mr clintons ways and join republicans in supporting the kasich budget bill clinton has broken his promise

least 800 per year in new taxes forcing every american family to tighten their belts yet these same democrats continue on their drunken spending spree refusing to cut their own budgets and even worse

listening to all of these members recite what their constituents were saying back home cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending the democratcontrolled rules committee turned down on a partyline vote all 46 of the significant cutting amendments offered by republicans and democrats alike amendments that would have cut several hundred million dollars from this bloated legislative expense budget that continues to hire 37 000 employees which i think is lust to make us look good why is this a charade mr speaker because after refusing to allow any of the significant cutting amendments to be offered and debated on this floor the democrat leadership in a cute little ployand you just heard it recited by the manager herein a cute little ploy made in order six small amendments have you people listened to it up there do you know what those six small amendments were for they were good amendments but none of them individually or in total significantly reduce this

that were magnanimously made in order which my good friend the gentleman from texas has said they were really gracious in allowing all these amendments if all six were allowed to pass they would not even cut our legislative budget by a tenth of 1 percent that means that congress this year will continue to spend on itself almost the same amount that it always has while socking it to the taxpayers of this nation to portray this legislative budget as a costcutting bill is a charade the american people have had enough they have had it with a congress that continues to raise their taxes so that

years ago i came here as a former small business owner thinking that i could have a real opportunity to help this nations small businesses however i found out over the last 2 weeks that that is not necessarily true let me tell what happened the lkst 2 weeks several weeks ago i found out that sba a federal agency that is supposed to act as an advocate of small businesses spent over 100 000 of taxpayers money to promote employee mandates i was shocked that the sba would do such a thing especially since small business owners and employees overwhelmingly oppose employer mandates they are frightened for good reason every credible study predicts substantial job losses as a result of the employer mandates so i decided to offer an amendment which would change this ridiculous situation my amendment was simple it would prohibit the sba from spending taxpayer dollars to promote employer mandates the first thing i found out is that my amendment will not be allowed to be offered on the floor unless the rules committee approves the rules committee decides which amendments can and cannot be offered on the house floor for debate so i went to the rules committee to offer my amendment i thought that this was a simple amendment and that it should not have any problem being accepted when i walked into the rules committee i was surprised i found out something interesting there are nine democrats and only four republicans serving on that committee suddenly i had a bad feeling about my amendments chances sure enough the democratcontrolled rules committee rejected my amendment remember my amendment is simply asking sba not to spend taxpayers money to promote employer mandates it was simply rejected they said that the sba bill was not the appropriate place to debate health care issues despite the fact that my amendment dealt specifically with the sba and despite the fact that our own house parliamentarian ruled that my amendment was perfectly germane this ruling was obviously very unfair so i went to the house floor to try and overturn the rules committees decision and you can guess it i was defeated again even though 10 brave democrats stood up lid joined all of the republicans in voting to overturn this unfair decision my amendment again was blocked despite this defeat i was not willing to give up the fight for small businesses in fact i found out that i had one last chance to get a vote on my amendment i decided to offer a socalled motion to recommit which would have forced the house to debate and vote on my amendment just as i was preparing to offer my

amendment they are scared to have a vote on my amendment they are terrified that this body might actually pass my amendment and reveal the truth that the american people dont want employer mandates and being taken over by government small business people do not want employer mandates california people do not want employer mandates because they know that with employer mandates it is not a question of whether jobs will be lost it is just a question of how many jobs will be lost this is exactly why the american people are so frustrated with congress they are frustrated because instead of debating issues openly and honestly the democrat leadership of this body delays and hides behind parliamentary rules the american people are frustrated because instead of telling the truth about employer mandates the democratic leadership uses its dominance of the house to force members to toe the biggovernment line on health care reform the american people should know the democrat leadership

their right to choose a doctor their right to run a small business their right to invent a new medicine you know we are one of the last nations in the world that does not have socialized medicine theoretically having socialized medicine is a mark of civilization for all the people who have stood up and said we are one of the few nations in the world that doesnt have socialized medicine we ought to have it i look at places like cuba with mr castro who has socialized medicine china has socialized medicine a lot of other third world nations have socialized medicine that is not a sign of civilization it is not a sign of sophistication if you look at the other side of that debate you will see a great nation the united states of america more than half of all of the cures for diseases that are invented annually in the world are invented in the united states isnt that interesting that means we invent more cures more medicines that save lives than all the rest of the nations in the world combined and i would suggest that that is because we do n6t have socialized medicine i would suggest that our freedom has been the driver for innovation our freedom has built a health care system that draws canadians down you know the canadian system was health care nirvana it was heaven on earth and we had a lot of well meaning groups who came in last year and told us how great the canadian health care system was then around christmastime the biggest hospital in ontario shut down for a couple of weeks because they ran out of money funny socialism always runs out of money because governments never spend money in an efficient manner so canadians saw their biggest hospital close down for 2 weeks because they ran out of money then we discovered something else about canadian health care there are 177 000 canadians who are waiting for operations they are waiting in line for operations because you know what socialism causes lines if you do not think so go to the kremlin sometime take a trip to some of those liberated countries in eastern europe socialism causes lines and about 25 percent of the people who were surveyed in canada of those 177 000 waiting in line for an operation 25 percent of them said they are in pain while they wait 01610 we looked at other places we looked at japan that theoretically spends less money on health care it does spend less money but do you know why they spend less money because the average japanese doctor sees 49 patients a day and i had this impression i do not know if my colleagues or you have seen that have read about those professional packers that they have in japan on the subway trains where they get everybody they possible can into the train right at rush hour then they have two professional packers these packers are like sumo wrestler they are big healthy people they do not hurt anybody but their job is to pack the last possible person that they can get into that train they want to get that guy picked right inside there so they can close the doors and go out with a full train that is the impression i had when i read that their doctors see 49 people a day they do mass examinations americans do not want to walk in with 15 or 20 people and do an examination en masse that is japan they are heavy on efficiency they are a little bit short on privacy let us look at great britain which has socialized medicine that socialism that winston churchill described as shared misery they have a system in which senior citizens elderly people are not given lifesaving operations that is because socialism never works very effectively and they ran out of money so they tell senior citizens who are over a certain age you cannot have this lifesaving operation because you have lived a long and full life and you have to fall off the tree like a leaf in the autumn and let a younger person have that lifesaving operation that is great unless you happen to have fathers and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers who mean something to you and you know american families have a lot of grandmothers and grandfathers who mean something to them and so we do not want to have that brand of socialized medicine to date this administration has not shown us one model country that has a medical system a socialized medical system that we should follow last let me talk about something that is kind of near and dear to americans hearts that is a job remember that gentleman herb kane who stood with the president on a nationally televised program and he said he is a guy who owns godfathers pizza his father worked three jobs a day so he could go to college and become a success and herb kane said mr president i have put a pencil to your numbers here to your plan i will have to fire a lot of people i am paraphrasing him he said this is not going to work out i am going to have to close down franchises and get rid of folks the president said to him i do not know why you just cannot raise the cost of your pizza i could see a look of shock on mr kanes face and when he addressed the republicans recently he said to the effect if i could get more money for my pizzas i would be doing it you cannot just raise the price of your product and expect to continue in business he said i am asked by people why i do not feel i have a duty to give every single person who works for me a health care plan he says that is because my first duty is to give them a job and we are going to lose a lot of jobs under socialized medicine the plan that the gentleman from missouri is putting together with other democrat leaders right now is socialized medicine it is socialized medicine that is going to require employer mandates that means employers are going to have to pay a big new tax we have a group that is a think tank and there is plenty of think tanks around the country but the consad study group did an evaluation on how many american jobs will be lost under the ways and means committee plan that is the democratcontrolled committee that developed the plan in this house that is being followed by the gentleman from missouri by the democrat leadership is putting together their socialized medicine

earlier today did commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman the gentleman from california for hishard work in bringing this bill to the floor today i also commend our full committee chairman the gentleman from california for his strong leadership in fashioning the balance that was struck in bringing the bill out of the committee on natural resources to the floor today i also commend the staff that has worked so hard on this legislation deborah lanzone and jim zoia of my staff madam chairman i want to note in my second and concluding comment that throughout the debate on this bill we have been hearing attacks by the other side and other opponents about how bad h r 322 is they have been touting some type of alternative to the pending measure this alternative of theirs was introduced in the house as h r 1708 and is identical to the bill passed earlier this year by the other body under the guise of mining law reform this is a bill of course that the pending legislation h r 322 will join in a conference committee as many of us know h r 1708 the bill passed by the other body by a voice vote hardly reflects true mining law reform it would allow the patenting of mining claimsthat is the outright purchase of the federal lands for the mere price of the surface estate of the land while allowing title to the underlying mineral estate to be transferred at no cost its royalty would not raise any revenue for the treasury the other bodys bill provides nothing in the way of environmental protections yet i must admit that i am somewhat perplexed amazed that those opposed to h r 322 in particular the vucanovich orton measure have not offered their alternative measure i noted that the gentleman from utah took to the floor a few minutes ago to lambast h r 322 and i sent to him as well as to others promoting that measure as being far superior to h r 322 that we have an open rule on this particular bill i have been somewhat taken aback that under an open rule governing debate on h r 322 these opponents have not seized the opportunity to advance their alternative legislation so i can only surmise madam chairman that they well know that if that measure was offered and taken to a vote they would garner very little support from this body and i mean very very little support i hope that is noted by the other body as we head to conference on this legislation"],

from new york that i have appreciated his leadership on the education and labor committee i appreciate his leadership on this issue of nafta and i thank him for his time and also for his straightforward commentary and nononsense way of approaching this debate i just have to say i want to jump over to one of my other committee assignments for a second one of the things that we have found out on the committee on banking finance and urban affairs of which i am also a member is that there are a lot of things about this nafta agreement across the board which many of us have not been privy to one of the things that i want to get into and mention the gentleman mentioned the fact of the newspaper in new york listing where the labor contributions of those who are opposed to nafta have come from i will tell the gentleman that like many of my other colleagues who oppose nafta it does not matter where the donations for your campaign come from when labor was spending 250 000 against this congressman from pennsylvania in his primary i was still opposed to nafta it had nothing to do with labor it had to do with the fact as to whether it was right or wrong so when labor was putting a quarter of a million dollars against me in the primary i was still opposed to nafta because it is a bad idea it will not work and all of our parents all of our grandparents everything they fought for in labor rights will be undermined by this agreement if it is passed in this house tomorrow and goes on to fruition i want to talk about the banking issues for just a moment i will tell the gentleman we had hearings 2 weeks ago in the banking committee and i thought i had heard everything about this nafta agreement we heard testimony from a woman by the nameof lucia duncan she described several accounts of mexican courts which had allowed seizure without cause of property that is owned by americans in mexico we also heard from ibms political agent in mexico mr kaveh moussavi that is the gentleman who went down to mexico and his entire purpose was to try to make the skies of mexico those who fly over the airspace of mexico safer because ibm was going to sell an air traffic control system to the country of mexico and he was asked by the salinas government for a payoff of 1 million in american dollars to a special fund set up by president salinas he said no ibm said no and when he went public with this he was declared by the salinas government to be public enemy no 1 of mexico simply because he filed a formal complaint a fraud complaint with the mexican government mr moussavi then went on to contact a mexican attorney to try to obtain some judicial redress in this nation and the attorney told him and this is a direct quote before the banking finance and urban affairs committee here in the unitedstates congress the attorney in mexico said your naivete is touching this is not the united kingdom nor is it the united states mr moussavi decided to go public with his case he decided to talk to us in the unitedstates congress to tell us in light of the oncoming nafta agreement about the dealings that ibm had in mexico he was threatened over the telephone in great britain where he happens to live that if he were to testify before the united states congress about corruption in the mexican government when he returned to britain he would have one less child i say to the gentleman from new york it is appalling to me but we have heard these stories in committee after committee where we are dealing with an outlaw government how can you have free trade when you are not dealing with a free government where since 1988 over 200 opposition political people have been assassinated in mexico where 28 journalists have been assassinated in mexico now these things that i tell you about were reported to the authorities in the u k and they have followed up on them mr moussavi is following through on these issues we heard from alejandro argueta a developer from tucson az and he is living proof of a large centralized banking system only 18 banks in mexico who defraud their clients and who steal their savings mr argueta testified before our committee about what he called gangster tactics that were used against him after he obtained 2 million from a mexican bank he said after that he was held incommunicado for 2 days because of a dispute with a mexican bank the owners of whom by the way had very close ties financially and politically with president salinas after he had a dispute with the owners of this bank who were friends of president salinas he was held incommunicado for 2 days and was imprisoned for 16 months following his imprisonment he was released only after he signed a promissory note which had changed the terms of his loan and subsequently the mexican government has deprived him of 20 million of his own funds now these are three stories of many stories that we have been told we have been told about the upcoming devaluation of the peso when the peso as estimated by at least three or four people who testified before our committee when the peso is devalued 10 to 20 percent you will see that trade surplus diminish instantly why are they not depreciating the peso now because they are waiting for the vote tomorrow ladies and gentleman it is upon the vote of this nafta agreement that the mexican government is waiting and they will believe me they will devalue the peso and you will see this trade surplus with mexico pardon the expression it will go south i yield back my time to the gentleman
