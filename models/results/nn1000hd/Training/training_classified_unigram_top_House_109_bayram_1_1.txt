but a couple of hours from tahoe national forest throughout the year sacramentans can be found taking advantage of this proximity using the park for hiking skiing and camping with 18 national forests and 20 million acres of national forestland in my home state of california we face the challenge of a wildfire on almost an annual basis many western states deal with forest fires every summer in addition americass forests also endure damage from hurricanes floods mudslides and our natural disasters all of these events require swift action from our nations brave network of first responders as well as tailored government policies to help forests regenerate over the long term the rule before us would authorize debate on h r 4200 a bill which its supporters see as a way to speed forest recovery by loosening or eliminating some federal regulations protecting our public lands such a proposal demands scrutiny and debate to warrant congressional action there must be a demonstrable need for such a proposal and reliable proof that the proposed solution meets that need unfortunately the evidence on the need for this bill points in both directions while some sources claim that this bill would improve the state of forests other scientific accounts indicate that h r 4200 would actually hurt the forest recovery process we do know that it would create a loophole to allow some industries to skirt compliance with the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act supporters contend that the logging industry is saddled with unfair government regulations which impede their postfire operations and ultimately hurt the forests themselves at the same time 35 percent of all logging in national forests in the past 6 years came from timber salvage in ways similar to this bill accounting for 35 million to 40 million annually the only difference is that now these activities have to comply fully with nepa and the endangered species act before moving forward while a cbo estimate projects that this bill would increase timber profits from salvaging by 40 percent the first question which must be answered is not one of business but one of science does the policy recommended under this bill make sense as i stated at the beginning the evidence is too murky to tell and we need to spend more time learning about and debating this issue before we act i am encouraged that the rules committee recognized this and made four amendments in order which will add to the public discourse on this bill however it is difficult to ignore the arguments of those opposed to h r 4200 one such voice comes from a january 2006 issue of sciencd magazine in that issue a group of researchers published a study of logging in the aftermath of the 2002 biscuit fire in oregon this peerreviewed study concluded that the impact of logging in these areas reduced regeneration of new trees by some 70 percent this single scientific articleis not the final word on such a complicated matter for sure but its findings are consistent withi a good portion of the larger body of literature on this subject and when so many experts express concern with h r 4200 members would be well advised to listen to their reservations and take time to reconsider the issue i will insert at this point in the record a letter to congress signed by 169 experts in the areas of biology ecology and forest management this group of researchers includes uc davis professors dr robert coats and dr peter moyle as well as 13 other californians dear members of congress the united states has made great strides by relying on science to inform our decision making science helped us travel to the moon advance medicine and health and understand the complex web of life on land and in rivers lakes and oceans science has also opened our eyes to the workings of forests and provided blueprints for federal plans to better protect the abundant natural resources of our public lands when we as scientists see policies being developed that run counter to the lessons of science we feel compelled to speak up proposed postdisturbance legislation specifically the forest emergency recovery and research act and the related forests for future generations act crafted as a response to recent fires and other disturbances is misguided because it distorts or ignores recent scientific advances under the labels of recovery and restoration these bills would speed logging and replanting after natural disturbances although logging and replanting may seem like a reasonable way to clean up and restore forests after disturbances like wildland fires such activity would actually slow the natural recovery of forests and of streams and creatures within them many scientistreviewed studies and syntheses please see the selected citations appended to this letter have recently come to this conclusion for example no substantive evidence supports the idea that fireadapted forests might be improved by logging after a fire in fact many carefully conducted studies have concluded just the opposite most plants and animals in these forests are adapted to periodic fires and other natural disturbances they have a remarkable way of recoveringliterally rising from the ashesbecause they have evolved with and even depend upon fire we are concerned that h r 4200 and s 2079 will bind us to land management practices that perhaps logical in the past are no longer tenable in the light of recent scientific understanding specifically postdisturbance logging impedes regeneration of forest landscapes when it compacts soils removes or destroys socalled biological legacies such as soil organic material seeds in the soil large standing and downed trees damages riparian corridors introduces or spreads invasive species causes erosion delivers sediment to streams from logging roads and steep slopes degrades water quality and damages populations of many aquatic species in testimony before the house subcommittee on resources november 10 2005 eminent forest ecologist and university of washington professor jerry franklin noted that logging dead trees often has greater negative impacts than logging of live trees he concluded that timber salvage is most appropriately viewed as a tax on ecological recovery beyond those concerns postdisturbance logging often intensifies the potential severity of future fires by concentrating the slash fromlogging at or near the ground rather than leaving plant material standingand providing perching nesting and feeding sites for wildlifesuch logging abruptly moves the material to the ground most of this material would naturally fall to the ground adding important supplies of nutrients and energy to the forest floor and structure in the form of woody debris to stream channels but this naturally happens over decades not in the relatively short time associated with a logging operation advocates of postdisturbance logging may argue that this slash can be disposed of with controlled burns and other treatments yet such treatments can severely damage underlying soils imposing other taxes on natural recovery one additional tax concerns us postfire logging taxes the public treasury recent analysis of postfire logging operations after oregons biscuit fire of 2002 shows that costs of the logging operations exceeded revenue by about 14 million for logging that removed more than 53 million board feet of timber dellasala et al 2006 science provides the best insight into the real consequences of our policies and actions ironically this legislation is crafted to ignore the science by waiving environmental reviews reviews that would makeuse of the scientific knowledge often available only because of expenditures of public funds failure to conduct full environmental reviews informed by that science will inevitably lead to ecological and economic harm from postdisturbance logging in short neither ecological benefits nor economic efficiency result from postdisturbance logging we therefore urge you to defeat these legislative efforts because they will set back forest recovery we urge you to work with your fellow lawmakers to craft legislation that will rely on the most uptodate scientific knowledge to protect the natural resources of the nations public lands sincerely isabella a abbott ph d wilder professor

republicans believe is less important than additional billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy education health care and the financial well being of our children and grandchildren despite

increase the numbers of people without health insurance and who are underinsured rather than embrace necessary fixes to the medicare prescription drug program republicans instead chose to continue billions of dollars in overpayments to managed care plans and despite regularly thumping their chests while claiming to support the troops republicans propose 6 0 billion in cuts to veterans health

individually but for our nation and way of lifeit is imperative that we begin our discussionat the beginning and that beginning wasnt on 911 weve been under attack for at least 30 years we did not want this fightwe did not invite this fightwe did not wish to engage in this battle however once our enemy crossed over the line confirmed for us and the worldthat they were unwilling to respect international law respect individual liberty respect sovereignty of nationsand that they were willing and desirous of engaging in mortal battleno other option was left to us or the civilized world abu musab alzarqawi on january 23 2005 said we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology so this discussion today comes down to a fundamental questionwhat is the appropriate strategy and tactic to adopt to win the war on terror will we withdraw and simply defenda policy of isolation and containment or will we aggressively combat terrorismand take the battle to our enemy this war is unlike any other in historywithout a doubt our enemy has no single home it recruits and trains its army from nations around the world the only unifying element is hatehate for the westhate for democracyhate for freedom of religionhate for liberty the only message our enemy understands is force period terrorists dont negotiateterrorists dont compromiseterrorists are not interested in peace to them thats weakness thankfully weve stayed the course thankfully weve persevered in both iraq and afghanistan the greatest threat to terrorism is freedom liberty and democracy in the middle east and beyond today the terrorists are truly on the run last week unitedstates and iraqi forces eliminated a qaeda in iraqs top terroristabu musab al zarqawi this was accomplished with excellent intelligenceknowing where the bad guys were and when and this information came from iraqi civiliansthat is a very positive sign this important step demonstrates many things we will hunt down terrorists and eliminate them wherever they are hiding the shackles of decades long terrorism are being removed from the middle east iraqi security forces are stepping up to the challenge iraqi citizens want to be free of terrorists and they are not going to sit idly by success breeds success never has that been more evident than this past week while zarqawi was eliminatedfinding him brought a treasure trove of information allowing unitedstates and iraqi forces to dismantle many more pieces of al qaedas puzzle success breeds success iraq just this past week selected 3 more officialscabinet ministersto serve in its standing government success breeds success it is also important for us to recall and reiterate why we are engaged in this war it is

buffet said they talk about class warfare and his class is winning amen mr buffet today house republicans are falling all over themselves to give the heirs of approximately 7 500 estates a tax cut this bill is not only morally reprehensible but fiscally irresponsible the center for budget and policy priorities estimates that this republican bill will cost 762 billion over its first 10 years you dont have 762 billion we are all correct you are going to borrow it for the chinese from the saudis from the germans from the japanese and others and who is going to pay the bill our children are going to have to pay the bill our grandchildren are going to have to pay that bill because you dont have the money the wall street journal which was quoted by mr thomas said the other day they didnt agree with paygo why dont they agree with paygo because it would undercut tax cuts why would it undercut tax cuts because you neither have the courage nor the ability to pay for your tax cuts vote

on his play station he loved playing with his sister dylan and his sister shasta were declared missing on may 16 2005 after police found the beaten and bound bodies of their mother their older brother and their mothers boyfriend authorities believe that joseph edward duncan iii a registered sex offender abducted shasta and dylan from their home and held them for 7 weeks at a primitive camp site in the vast forests of montana according to shasta duncan repeatedly molested the children and eventually he killed dylan shasta was discovered on july 2 at a local restaurant with duncan two days later human remains were discovered at that primitive remote western montana camp site and on july 10 the remains were identified as dylan groene this person 9 years of age investigators have not really told us exactly what they believe happened to dylan or how long they believe the boy was alive after the childrens mother 13yearold brother and her boyfriend were beaten to death but they have given us some information sheriff rocky watson has said that he believes the motives for the killings of course was to acquire these two children as sex objects watson always said authorities believe the family was chosen at random but the attack was carefully planned the police have interviewed shasta a couple of times and the details are agonizing and they are slow in being revealed but she has provided certain information thatis astonishing dylan when he was 9 like the others that i have mentioned was a real person he wanted to live like all kids but he never made it to his tenth birthday because of this criminal this individual by the name of joseph duncan ill joseph duncan by the time he was 16 he had committed 13 sexual assaults in 1980 duncan was arrested for breaking into a neighbors house stealing guns and then accosting a 14yearold and sexually assaulting him at gunpoint he was convicted of the rape and sentenced to a naximum of 20 years in the penitentiary however in lieu of prison somebody sent duncan to the sex offender treatment center at western state hospital an evaluation at western state mental hospital found that duncan who was then 17 met the definition of a sexual psychopath so western state hospital had given up on duncan then at 19 he announced that he wanted to leave treatment and serve the rest of his time in the penitentiary so he received 14 more years for the rape and sexual assault and 3 more for parole violations when he got out of the penitentiary he moved to fargo north dakota then after leaving the penitentiary he decided to create a blog on the internet many of the entries appear to focus on his own sexual abuse crimes and he seemed to be proud of it it also shows us his rage over how sex offenders are treated in our community brenda grone and her boyfriend mark mckenzie and the 13yearold slade grone were killed in their home sometime on may 15 by joseph edward duncan iii they were beaten to death with a hammer duncan after kidnapping shasta he told her and explained to her what he did to these three before he murdered them he said he watched the house and specifically had watched her for 2 or 3 days at night he would sneak up to the houseand peer into the windows he said it was real simple to kidnap them and kill the other three he said he used a night vision goggle to learn about the familys layout before breaking into the home and he bragged to shasta about killing her family with a hammer and he even taunted her with the hammer that he had used to kill her family duncan was charged with firstdegree

loved chocolate chip ice cream cookies and milk in july of 1994 at the age of 7 megan an enthusiastic animal lover was lured into a neighbors home 100 feet from her own door once again another child predator living in our neighborhoods she went over to his house with the hopes of seeing his new puppy he claimed he had that neighbor unknown to megans parents was a convicted sex offender the chatty little girl rode her bike over to jessie timmendequas home he told her that he had a puppy but it was too young to go outside so she needed to go inside to see it of course there was no puppy it was a lie the defendant timmendequas was a previously convicted sex offender and he sexually assaulted megan then like the others he murdered her when he got her into the house he tried to kiss her but she attempted to escape so he strangled megan with a belt he says he slammed her head into the dresser and strangled her he sexually assaulted her he tied two bags over her head he tied two bags over her head he put her body into a toy box and he drove his pickup truck to a nearby park with her in the toy box he sexually assaulted her again and dumped her body into a patch of high weeds in the hours following megans disappearance a massive search effort took place all over the quiet hamilton township of new jersey the red and blue lights of police cars filled the once quiet suburban neighborhoods police were instantly drawn to timmendequas home after learning that he and his roommates were both convicted sex offenders they immediately questioned him and only 1 day later he confessed and led the police to megans body his history well he had a criminal history of sexual assault of children in 1 979 timmendequas pled guilty to the attempted and aggravated sexual assault of a 5yearold girl in new jersey he was given a suspended sentence that means in simple terms he did not go to jail but somebody recommended that he get counseling for his sexual assaults he did spend 9 months in the middlesex adult correction center then in 1981 he pled guilty in regard to the sexual assault of a 7yearold girl he was imprisoned for 6 years in may of 1997 he was sentenced to death for the murder ofnichole kanka he remains on death row in new jersey state prison in trenton hopefully justice will be done and he will see his maker soon in honor of megans memory a section of the child safety act creates the megan nichole kanka and alexandra nichole zapp community notification program this program requires appropriate officials to notify the communities within 5 days of a change of a registered sex offenders information megans parents had no idea that a sex offender was living across the street from them in their quiet suburban neighborhood hopefully the child safety act will

1y 2005 co active in the school band but on the night of october 1 1993 polly klass was hosting her first sleepover party with two of her friends when polly went to retrieve pillows from another room she was confronted by a large hulking man armed with a knife the man richaxgt allen davis threatened to kill all the kirls if they did not do as he told them to davis made his way into the bedroom of the 12yearold polly klass and he tied her up with her two sleepover companions and then he abducted her when pollys body was found later she had been brutally sexually assaulted and strangled to death davis is a career criminal whose life has a twisted tangle of much violence and criminal activity a few days after pollys abduction davis confessed to the inurder and led the police to her body after a trial he was found guilty of first degree murder he was sentenced to death as he should have been perhaps the most telling part of pollys story is this according to pollys father she had always had a fear of the dark she had trouble sleeping unless there was a night light on as many children are she was scared of the boogey man and the possibility of being kidnapped it is unfortunate in our culture too many kids go to sleep afraid of the boogey man like richard allen davis it was something that she had discussed often with her parents and her father mark recalls with bitter irony how he had assured his daughter that everything would be all right and that he would be there to protect her there are more children there are many more in this country tonight i have just listed a few a few

night by john couey the police found where she had poked her fingers through the plastic bag seeking air to breathe that is the way that jessica lunsford died john couey well who is he he is a convicted sex offender with a criminal history a mile long it includes 24 arrests and goes back over 30 years two of the arrests were allegatiois of home invasions where he had molested little girls i have talked to mark lunsford at length he is a good guy he loved his daughter as all fathers do girlsare special to those of us who are fathers and he says he will never get over the fact that he lost his daughter and the way that she was murdered of courbe he will not get over it and hopefully none of us in this united states will get over it jessica lunsford 9 state of florida dylan and shasta groene were declared missing may 16 this year after police found the beaten and bound bodies of their mother their older brother and their mothers boyfriend shasta was discovered on july 2 just a

the boy was alive after the childrens mother 13yearold brother and their mothers boyfriend were beaten to death sheriff rocky watson has said he believes the motive for the killings was to acquire these two children for sex watson also said authorities believe the family was chosen at random but the attack was carefully planned and executed by the criminal f1 1800 the police have interviewed shasta the daughter a couple of times and the details are agonizing and slow in being revealed but she has provided helpful information sheriff watson does not go into all the facts and say what he believes happened to the girl and to dylan but those actions are not good dylan he was 9 like the others that i have mentioned he was a real person he wanted to live like all kids but he never made it to his 10th birthday because of the criminal this individual by the name of duncan duncan by the time he was 16 he had committed 13 rapes in 1980 duncan was arrested for breaking into a neighbors house stealing guns and then accosting a 14yearold boy and raping him at gun point he was convicted of rape and sentenced to the maximum of 20 years in the penitentiary however in lieu of prison somebody sent duncan to the sex offender treatment center at western state hospital in 1980 an evaluation at western state mental hospital found that duncan who was only 17 met the definition of a sexual psychopath western state hospital had given up on duncan he was 19 and he announced that he wanted to leave treatment and serve the rest of the time in prison so he served 14 years for the rape and three more for parole violations when he got out of the penitentiary he moved to fargo north dakota duncan after leaving the penitentiary he decided to create a blog on the internet and many of the entries appear to focus on his own sexual abuse crimes he seems to be proud of it and his rage over how sex offenders are treated in our community brenda groene and her boyfriend mark mckenzie and

sarah lunde while in jail awaiting trial he was caught trying to dig his way out of the jail he had stolen some type of metal object and was digging into the concrete floor he waits for his day in court sarah lunde 13 the assault on children continues the last example i would like to discuss occurred in houston texas it happened this year i want to read and paraphrase from different articles of the houston chronicle which relate the events better than 1 can according to the houston chronicle on february 4 2005 a 6monthold little girl showed up at texas childrens hospital severely abused physically and sexually and was put on life support by the hospital authorities she was only able to breathe because she was on a respirator this 6monthold little girl had been penetratedaiid raped vaginally and anally her tongue had been severed almost completely off the baby mind you six months of age was in critical condition at the hospital the babys parents were arrested put in police custody and charges have been filed against them according to the hospital authorities one said it is the worst case i have ever seen where a child has suffered such horrific types of injuries and is still alive the pain that this baby girl must have suffered doctors have found other signs of abuse since the babys admittance the parents who are not married are in their early 20s they took this child to doctors parkway hospital and told the staff she had some problems the medical staff obviously became suspicious of abuse and transferred the 6monthold baby and another child a 15month old the sister of the 6monthold to texas childrens hospital texas childrens hospital examined both of the kids and noticed that the 15monthold had an old broken rib and skull fractures childrens protective services took official legal custody of both girls and the 15monthold is now in foster care when the 15monthold was a month old she suffered a fracture to her leg she also had hemorrhaging in different parts of her body which was indicative of shaken baby syndrome according to child protective services they are not sure who did this so the father was charged with injury of a child in december 2003 but for some reason the case was dismissed in october once again this is the 15monthold daughter the mother had gone to some parenting classes and some therapy and told some officials that she had left the older child with the father and was living with her parents but for some reason the toddler was sent home to her mother these children are vulnerable they cannot tell anyone and they do not have anyone to turn to according to the houston chronicle the 6monthold was still fighting for her life she had been physically and sexually abused she was covered with brutal injuries according to the police she has been partly blinded by the injuries and now the parents ivan castaneda 22 and donna marie norman 19 are each charged with injury to a child and being held without bond if this 6monthold dies they would be charged with capital murder this little girl however is a remarkable person even though she had been admitted to the hospital in february her kidneys ceased functioning she was put on dialysis she had skull fractures injuries to her lungs liver kidneys and her eyes she continues to live and continues to live to this day i have talked to lieutenant stanley of the houston police and he said that the investigators investigating these cases are having difficulty handling the abuse that they personally saw however the 6monthold has defied all odds the reddishhaired infant described as the miracle baby has been released to a family that hopes to adopt her the baby has been in hospital for some time but according to a hospital spokesperson it was a great day because this child survived the most brutal of all attacks physically and sexually abused every part of her body bruised but some way she survived so they call her wonder baby six months she lived to the age of six months when she was physically and sexually abused but today she is still alive she is the only person i will talk about tonight that survived these brutal attacks these are just a few stories of real people real children in our communities that were preyed on by some sexual predator there is some hope however things are happening to protect children in the united states here in washington d c we have the national childrens alliance it was the idea of the gentleman from alabama who sits on the other side of the aisle proof that child abuse child protection is a bipartisan issue what this national childrens alliance does is protect children that have been abused and sexually assaulted throughout the country there are some 400 different centers where children who are assaulted sexually can go and be treated their medical and emotional needs can be met and they can be interviewed so criminal prosecution can take place against the perpetrator we probably have the best one of these centers in houston texas called the childrens assessment center the reason for these centers is this it used to be when i first started prosecuting cases and then when i was a criminal court judge when a crime was committed against a child especially a sexual assault crime the system continued to sometimes commit crimes against the child the justice system was not really justice for the kid what i mean is they would be interviewed by a police officer then taken to a hospital and interviewed by medical personnel they would sit in the emergency room with other people sometimes for hours then they would go downtown and be interviewed by the police and sometimes the children would be on the elevator at the police station and who else would be on the elevator the perpetrator going to be interviewed for the criminal conduct they would be bounced around all over the city interviewed by different prosecutors but now thankfully because of the national childrens alliance and the childrens assessment center in houston those days are over when kids are sexually assaulted they go to one center where all of their needs are met they are interviewed their physical needs are met when they are continuing to need more physical or mental therapy later they go back to this same center the people that are there are experts in child sexual assault cases and those people are available for trial when the perpetrator is caught and his day in court arrives that is some good news unfortunately we have to have these centers throughout the united states where children go who are sexually abused by the predators in our community this year before the house and the senate it was learned that money that goes to protect victims of crime was being depleted and removed from the budget let me explain in 1994 the president of the united states established what is called voca funding victims of crime act what that allows is for a person who is convicted of a federal crime they contribute moneys into a fund and that money goes to victims of crime for their medical and physical needs what a wonderful idea make criminals pay for the system that they have created by establishing this voca fund once again this is not money that is obtained from taxpayers it is obtained from criminals this year there was about 1 6 billion in the voca funding and there was an attempt and thought to remove this money and put it into the general fund thanks to the efforts of numerous victims groups throughout the united states and individuals on both sides of the aisle in not only the house but the senate that fund has been restored and victims organizations throughout the united states will be able to get that funding where does it go it goes to domestic violence shelters it goes to child abuse sexual assault centers like the childrens assessment center and numerous organizations that receive funds that criminals have contributed that is some good news we have also started this year the victims rights caucus i along with the gentlewoman from florida and the gentleman from california from the other side of the aisle have started the firstever victims rights caucus to raise the profile the plight of victims throughout the united states this is a good start it is important that judges throughout the united states be on the first line of defense of our children what i mean by that is when individuals are caught sexually assaulting our children and they come to court and they have their day in court and they are convicted judges need to understand they have a responsibility to punish those individuals we need to lock them up that is why we build prisons it may be important to prosecute thieves and drug dealers and all those other types of criminals but we build prisons to house and warehouse people who commit sex crimes against our children that is why we build those institutions and judges have an obligation to send them there the cases that i recited earlier many of them they had gone to prison but not for long enough because they got out and did it again we know the fact that almost everybody who goes to prison gets out eventually we also know this about sexual predators on our children that the overwhelming number of them when they leave the penitentiary repeat that conduct so we have an obligation when they get out of the penitentiary to keep up with them to track them so they can no longer haunt our schools our boy scouts our churches and our neighborhoods that is why i introduced legislation called the child predator act of 2005 this legislation requires registration of sex offenders throughout the united states when they cross state lines we lose them they fall through the cracks this legislation will require them to register when they move across state lines they must notify the community and by failure to notify they have committed a federal offense this act this bill has been incorporated in a larger bill sponsored by the gentleman from wisconsin sponsors from both sides of the house called the child safety act this bipartisan legislation when hopefully passed this summer is a measure that will protect the safety of children it will allow for the internet access of parents and law enforcement of those sexual predators that live in their communities states will be required to notify each other when an individual who is a sex offender crosses state lines there are numerous other provisions thatprotect children from sex offenders but basically we will track these individuals when they leave the penitentiary and we will track them for the rest of their lives that is the price they pay when they choose to commit a crime against children we know this about child predators they are slick they are cunning they are evil and they continue to repeat their conduct most sexual predators that show up at the courthouse that have committed sex crimes against children it is understood that they have committed several sex crimes against that one victim and that there are at least 10 other victims that they have committed sex crimes against there is a war on terror going on in this world and we say it is somewhere else we have a war on terror not only abroad but we have it at home the terror here they are child molesters they are the bad guys and they can no longer run and hide because we are going to keep up with them we know that they cannot be rehabilitated all statistics show that so if we do not keep them in prison we need to track them when they leave the penitentiaries it is probably the hope of most of us when we leave this world when we die that we want to be surrounded with the most important people in our life probably our kids this week i had my third grandchild born 2 days ago elizabeth i have four kids three girls a son and now three grandkids they are all very special to me i hope that when i die i am surrounded by those kids the worst thing i think that could ever happen to a parent is to lose a child and especially lose a child to a crime of violence but none of these children that i talked about tonight left this world surrounded by the people that love them they were found in holes in the ground dumped on parking lots thrown in rivers and lakes some of their bodies were burned the last person they saw on earth was not their mother their father their brother their sister but a sex offender that is the last person they saw before they died we need to be sensitive as a people to our children not just our own personal kids but the children down the street our neighbors kids we need to watch for them and protect them we have that obligation we have that moral and legal obligation as a people these kids these children they had the right to life they had the right to grow up play in their backyard go to school have a picnic run through the fields believe in santa claus play sports be in the school play be in the high s6hool prom find a mate all these things were stolen from all of the kids that i mentioned to you tonight and they were stolen by a child predator we must hold these criminals accountable for their conduct as a judge i heard all types of excuses by these sexual predators about why they did what they did those comments by those individuals were nothing more than excuses some of them said they had a bad childhood their mom was not a nice person they saw too much tv violence they played video games they watched the internet they continued to blame something or someone else for their own personal choices we now seem to live in the land of excusable conduct all of us are responsible for the choices that we make every choice we make we are personally responsible for that choice we are accountable for making those choices and those choices must result in consequences regardless of what that crime is our greatest resource in this country is not our oil it is not the trees in the west it is not other natural resources it is not our wealth the greatest resource we have in the united states is our children we as a people must realize that we are not judged by the way we treat the rich the famous the influential the important people in our culture we are judged by the way we treat the weak the innocent the children children are our greatest natural resource we have a legal and moral obligation to protect them the first duty of government is public safety and providing safety for children should be our primary concern and the duty of government i close the way i began this comment because i think the names of these people these real people these children are names that we should not forget dru sjoden 22 north dakota cary ann medlin 8 tennessee nicole parker 8 california

thank my colleagues debbie wasserman schultz and also my good friends from the great state of massachusetts mr bill delahunt i am so glad mr delahunt is here we were talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this is facts not fiction the unitedstates department of the treasury backs this up 1 01 trillion borrowed in 224 years since 1776 to the year 2000 versus 1 05 trillion that was borrowed from 2001 to 2005 and counting from the president and the republican majority congress we are saying that we want to pay as we go we are saying that we want to make sure that we are fiscally responsible and we are saying that we are not going to allow the republican majority to be able to have these countries look at america in a different way than they were prior to this administration and prior to this

particular amendment because it is a significant amendment as it was indicated under the patriot act the fbi can merely assert at this point in time that records are relevant to an intelligence investigation that can be just simply about foreign policy objectives in addition it added a permanent nondisclosure requirement which if violated imposed severe sanctions on the recipient of the socalled national security letter this was truly a profound expansion of government power where the subject of the order need not be suspected of any involvement in terrorism whatsoever where there was no judicial review where there was no statutory right to challenge and where the order gags the recipient from telling anyone about it a federal district court in new york has already ruled that the national security letters for communication records as amended by the patriot act are unconstitutional because they are coercive and violate the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and the first amendment as a result of the gag order this amendment i would submit at tempts to salvage the use of national security letters in intelligence investigations so as to comply with constitutional standards it gives the recipient of a national security letter his day in court he can consult a lawyer a judge can reject or modify the fbi demand upon a finding that compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive the recipient can also seek to modify or set aside the gag order if the court makes certain findings that it was unnecessary the amendment goes further to modify the nondisclosure requirement so that the recipients can tell other people with whom they work about the demand so that they can comply with the order as i suggested the current law is of dubious constitutionality and i would suggest this amendment would permit appropriate use of socalled national security letters that would not only pass constitutional muster but would be sound policy it also i believe strikes a more reasonable balance between privacy and freedom on the one hand and national security on the other with only a negligible burden imposed on the government and so i urge passage"], [0.002737700939178467, 0.5027377009391785, 0, "thank you for yielding me time on this i have worked on this issue for a number of years in congress i have seen failed policies and i have seen successful policies the worst thing we could do today would be to cut the funds to colombia what a horrible message we would sezld let me just describe what is taking place the policy of failure the policy of success i chaired the criminal justice drug policy subcommittee that was one of the responsibilities speaker hastert had before i inherited it from him he chaired the national security sub committee that had that responsibility we did everything we could during the clinton administration to get resources to colombia the liberals did everything they could to keep resources goingto colombia the policy was a policy of failure it was a policy of death and destruction thousands of people were slaughtered while the liberals in congress and the administration denied aid to colombia policemen were killed by the thousands members of the legislature members of the cabinet people on the street villages were wiped out because they did not want to send the necessary aid to colombia president bush thank god for president bush and his action and his policy of success he took a policy of success he put the resources there the murders are down dramatically the last speaker spoke about creating economic opportunity how can you create economic opportunity or economic activity when there is slaughter and chaos in the streets i went down with president pastrana and he wanted to sing kumbayah with the terrorists and the leftists and that approach did not work people continued to get slaughtered and the drugs came into this country in unprecedented amounts ask dea about drugs about heroin at the beginning of the clinton administration you know how much heroin was produced in colombia zero look at it now and look at it over the past years it flooded into our streets and killed our children and our most productive citizens and those with potential in this country by the thousands and has left thousands being destroyed in colombia this is a horrible amendment it would be a horrible step backwards to bring drugs into this country to stop a policy and now we have been blessed not only with a president with strong determination and a good successful policy in this country but one in that country who just got reelected and to cut his legs out from under him at this juncture when he has experienced success not only have we stopped the killings and the murders and the slaughters there and stopped people from dying in our streets the economy has dramatically increased almost doubled in colombia since presidents bush and uribes policies have taken place this would be a step backward this is a step towards death destruction and drugs coming into our country i have had it with the liberals who allowed this to happen and let thousands of people go to their deaths in colombia who allowed drugs to proliferate in that country and create and finance narcoterrorism which destroyed some of that region and thousands of lives there and thousands of lives here if we pass that amendment it is a horrible step back i cannot tell you how important this amendment is not only to the lives in colombia but to the lives of the young men and women and those in this country that have been victims i urge people to vote this down in huge numbers"], [0.002783536911010742, 0.5027835369110107, 0, "again i want to thank congressman miller from california for bringing this resolution which continues to focus of course on june as homeownership month but continues to put this issue out on the table we have done that with the housing opportunity subcommittee through our ranking member we were the first committee of the house to go to new orleans and gulfport mississippi where believe me there are so many issues for people but housing and shelter not being in a shelter but housing and to be sheltered from the elements were the number one issue down there we have addressed also so many pieces of legislation i think it has to make our committee feel good in the sense that they have done something we wont know the faces or the names of people in fact that will now be able to have homeownership or with section 8 to be into apartments we wont know who they are but acts of the congress working together which is the right thing to do will help with the peoples lives i just want to on a personal note say i can remember after world war ii and my father came out of world war ii it took from that period of time to 1963 to in fact be able to save enough and i have talked to the gentlelady about down payments i am one who firmly believes that we should help people because to take 13 years to save for something it is a long time there is a famous poet langston hughes who said dream your dreams and be willing to pay the sacrifice to make them come true people are willing to sacrifice for that dream of a home but we as the government have to help them there is a certain point where so much sacrifice has to be given it is not helping with the family that is what we need to do people will be out there they will try to make their living try to pay their bills try to get into their home but what we are doing in this com mittee and what we have to continue to do and i am sure we will with the ranking member and the gentlelady from california and with her tenacity on this issue her concern for people as the members of the committee have been concerned about these issues we will continue to do that because people are willing to sacrifice but we have got to help them along and we have got to give them some assistance as a government i am very proud of the subcommittee and very proud of mr miller and the resolution i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
