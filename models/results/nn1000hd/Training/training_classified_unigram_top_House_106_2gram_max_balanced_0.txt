the wealthiest people in this country had they not tried this trick we would be in a different position here today this year the final year of the 20th century has been a disappointing one for the american families every time congress has had the opportunity to help families in a meaningful way the republican leadership has sided with the special interests over the public interests the list of casualties is long a patients bill of rights campaign finance reform medicare prescription drug benefits smaller class sizes and sensible gun safety reform is also being killed since the columbine tragedy occurred more than 6 months ago the republican leadership has consistently stifled every attempt to pass common sense gun safety measures and yet 13 children every day are killed by guns with 100 000 kids bringing guns to school every year they should be ashamed of themselves the republican leadership for letting the nra write our gun laws and obstructing our attempts to close the

cuts 2 9 billion from education services cuts 1 7 billion from labor with cuts to workforce development and safety investments and cuts more than 1 billion from critical health programs and next week we will be forced to vote on this bill that undermines so many of our nations priorities why because the republican house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations and here we are again voting on a measure that would provide over 50 billion to the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers how much is enough when will republicans be satisfied with the amount of money they have given to the wealthy and turn their attention to the majority of americans who want a good education a strong work force and a healthy future this bill will cost 50 billion per year when fully phased in this monstrous hole in the federal budget will undoubtedly translate into cuts from areas that the american people care about just as the proposed 175 billion republican tax cut translated into cuts in yesterdays proposed labor hhs education appropriations bill when we prioritize tax cuts over health education and labor we make sacrifices and these sacrifices affect everybody the repeal of the estate tax does nothing for working families most american families would not receive a single dollar of tax relief from this bill so i want the american people to know what they are sacrificing in order to provide a tax cut to the wealthiest two percent of their fellow citizens republicans have proposed cutting 1 billion from targeted investments in education to improve teacher quality and recruit new teachers denying afterschool services to 1 6 million kids and eliminating headstart assistance to 50 000 kids they have also proposed cutting nih 439 million below current services and cutting 16 million from clintons request for battered womens shelters these are the kinds of sacrifices that americans are being asked to make in exchange for a tax cut that would give 300 billion to the 400 richest americans 300 billion is enough to pay for a prescription drug benefit for seniors for 10 years the republican majority placed the needs of big business over working people yesterday by voting to once again delay the implementation of new ergonomics regulations which protect working people from repetitive motion injuries and here they are again asking working families to make sacrifices so that the wealthy can reap benefits slowing our progress in health education and labor in order to make room for tax cuts for the wealthy does not

rise in support of this continuing resolution our twelfth in 5 weeks to keep the government operating but i deeply regret that we have reached this point and i am deeply disappointed by what has happened to americas education priorities in the last 72 hours on sunday night after 3 days of no negotiations republicans met facetoface with democrats on a good faith basis to resolve our differences on education democrats asked republicans whether they had full authority to negotiate a final deal and they answered yes in an example of bipartisan compromise both sides came together and both sides sought common ground negotiators toiled late into the evening each side made concessions as must be done in a bipartisan compromise and consensus was reached through sensible dialogue i give great credit to the gentleman from florida and i give great credit to the gentleman from wisconsin and the senators who were involved the bill that came out of that room was a bipartisan bill that would have lifted up every community and every school in this country this bill included full funding for 100 000 new teachers teacher training afterschool programs and a billion dollars for school repair and school modernization less than 12 hours after the agreement was reached the leaders of the republican party ripped this deal apart as a favor to a business lobby the republican leadership bowed to business lobbyists who according to the washington post were making and i quote urgent calls to the hill to try to block this compromise simply because they did not like worker safety provisions that protected workers from repetitive stress injuries this republicanled congress scuttled a bipartisan agreement that would have provided local districts with the means to hire new teachers and build new classrooms so that we could get smaller classroom sizes so that our children could be better educated i guess it is not a surprise because republican leaders have spent the last 6 years frustrating americas agenda a bipartisan agenda by giving in to special interests on every one of these issues the republican leadership has taken the side of the special interests over americas agenda we tried to get an affordable effective prescription medicine program we forced it on to the agenda with the help of republican members and it was scuttled in conference and it is not going anywhere because i guess the pharmaceutical companies did not want it we worked with republicans to force on to the agenda of this house an effective and enforceable patients bill of rights and it has been stifled in a conference committee because i guess the insurance companies did not want it we could have had targeted tax cuts for college and longterm care and child care but instead we passed huge tax cuts for the top 1 percent of americans instead of getting something done in a bipartisan way that we could have gotten done we fought for sensible gun safety legislation but it is stifled in a conference committee i guess as a favor to the national rifle association we have tried to get a sensible increase in the minimum wage but it too is stifled even though it has strong bipartisan support we forced on to the agenda of this house campaign finance reform which is desperately desired by the people of this country and it too passed by a bipartisan vote in this house and it has been stifled in a conference committee there is a pattern here there is a pattern bipartisan efforts which even passed by bipartisan votes on the floor are being held hostage by the special interests of this country and by the republican leadership that is running this congress the speaker said 2 years ago that the trains were going to run on time and that we would finish our budget in regular order well it is 4 weeks into the fiscal year we are 6 days away from a general election and we have not gotten the work done that we could have gotten done if the leadership of this congress would have simply let the bipartisan majority that was trying to break out and do these things to be able to do them and as a result we have a dysfunctional congress we have an ineffectual congress education is our most important priority we have schools with cracked walls and no airconditioning and leaky windows we have cornices falling off of buildings we have kids in temporary structures in movable classrooms in inadequate facilities in the wealthiest nation on earth our children deserve our help in getting them the worldclass education that every child in this country deserves let us

this is an hour i have secured on behalf of our conference and i know there are many who are eager to come to the floor today and have expressed their desire to come to speak about the prospect of passing real tax relief for the american people the debate over this topic is an interesting one and it is one that we have heard part of so far tonight but i want to tell the other side of that story and alert house members and those throughout the country who are perhaps monitoring tonights proceedings precisely what is at stake with the debate on the projected taxpayers surplus or overpayment of tax revenues and the prospect of tax relief for american families we just heard the previous speaker talk about his assurances that the government will manage the taxpayers money and they will propose to do it well i have no question or doubt about that i believe all members of congress are sincere and that those of us who are charged with the responsibility of keeping track of the taxpayers cash would like to do that in a responsible way and would like to manage that money well but that really neglects the underlying debate and that is who should be managing the money of the taxpayers now those dollars that have legitimate cause to come to washington to be spent should be managed well certainly and that is our job as members of congress but the fact of the matter is the american taxpayers are overpaying when it comes to their taxes they are sending more cash to washington d c than is necessary to legitimately run the government so the question becomes what do we do with the projected taxpayers surplus now the core principles of tomorrows debate and the debate that is ongoing in washington in fact the difference between liberals those we just heard and conservatives that we will hear now is on the following basis conservatives the republican party believes in personal freedom and that is as opposed to our opponents objectives those we just heard of government control and i emphasize the notion of government control again by citing the quote that we had just heard on the floor that government will manage the taxpayers money conservatives believe in personal freedom our opponents on the house floor who oppose tax relief believe that government should control the taxpayers cash republicans are for lower taxes versus higher taxes republicans are for limited government versus big government we are also for economic growth versus the bureaucratic control of our economy and we are for more jobs versus red tape the debate on tax relief and what to do with the tax overpayment could not be boiled down any more simply than that which we see here so let me carry on on those very points and let me start by referring to some of my own constituents i like many other members of congress meet with constituents as often as i possibly can in fact i hold a town meeting in my congressional district every monday morning before i hop on a plane to come here to washington i also send out public opinion surveys to my constituency and ask them to give me their opinions on a host of issues i ask questions like what is the single most important issue facing the country today what is the single most important issue facing your family what do you think are the biggest challenges for our schools and so on i just grabbed a handful as i was walking out of the office today we read these as they come in question number seven on my congressman bob schaffer public opinion survey is what should be done with any federal budget surpluses a respondent kirk and kathy brush from fort collins colorado write in true surpluses should result in tax cuts here is another one again question no 7 what should be done with any federal budget surpluses to strengthen social security and reduce taxes that from james sanden of fort collins colorado mr and mrs gerald simmons say of the surpluses any surpluses should be returned to the taxpayers ihave more here is a gentleman who sent a letter in with his response this is another individual from fort collins colorado mr ray mr ray says that taxes are the number one issue when it comes to the surplus relief for retired persons living on pension income while the contribution to most allocated pension accounts were made taxdeferred and the earnings deferred i believe the tax upon withdrawal should be less than the rate for ordinary income after all that money which mostly goes into the stock market enables corporations to have additional capital to expand thereby advancing our economy which generates additional revenue for the government he hits it right on the head here is another one the mcfarlands mr and mrs mcf arland they wrote in again the question what should be done with the federal budget surpluses my constituents the mcfarlands tell me it should be returned to the taxpayers who worked all of their lives to earn it dont you agree mr and mrs mcfarland if they were here on the floor which they are not but i would tell them as i do tell them when i see them back home that i do agree with them and frankly the majority of members of congress agree with them as well and certainly this is the sentiment expressed by the mcfarlands that will be carried on the house floor tomorrow and upon which we will move forward with returning some of their hardearned dollars back to them and all of their friends and neighbors as well the bill which we will be considering tomorrow h r 2488 provides approximately 864 billion in broadbased tax relief the proposal is highlighted by a 10 percent acrosstheboard reduction in individual income taxes the bill reduces the impact of the marriage tax penalty by increasing the standard deduction from married couples to twice that of a single person i could not bring newlyweds onto the house floor tonight but i brought a picture of some here is a standard newlywed couple on their wedding night what they are about to find out when they pay taxes for the first time filing jointly is that this federal government will penalize them assuming they are an average family to the extent of about 1 400 per year thatis as a result of a number of taxes that when combined and when considered together just increase put a portion of their income into higher tax brackets and they will be penalized for getting married imagine that in a country as great as ours with a rich tradition of the most essential and central social unit being the family and the institution of marriage why on earth would we penalize marriage why would we punish people for joining in lifelong unions in a way that results in the most civil society in the history of human civilization it is wrong everyone knows it is wrong but there is really only one party here in washington who cares about this family and who cares about the tax burden and wants to do something to prevent them from getting hit with this unfortunate penalty upon their wedding day and each year thereafter you see there are many of us who believe that american people know how to do better with their own income that they should not send it here to washington unless it is absolutely necessary to run the basic programs and services that we have to in fact what we have seen through a number of presidents is the power of tax relief on the american economy president kennedy and president reagan behind him both found that by reducing the overall tax rate in other words the rate applied to general income to determine federal taxes by reducing the tax rate the federal government actually increased revenues that is right that is hard for people to grasp in many cases but it is not all that hard if we just look at the economic history in recent years in our country lowering the effective tax rate on the american people leaves more cash in the economy more cash in the economy creates more jobs creates more wealth when more people are working and being productive and increasing incomes although they are paying a lower tax rate they are paying more dollars to the federal government in fact in the years of the reagan administration and the kennedy administration before them the result of tax rate reductions was increased revenues to the federal government and so once again what we see in the core principles is that by focusing on personal freedom of the american people leaving excess taxes in the pockets of those who earn those dollars we believe that we will see increased economic productivity in the country again that is contrasted with our opponents objective of government control people in washington like government control do not get me wrong if you are part of this washington culture you would certainly understand that fortunately most members of congress are not part of that culture they go home on weekends and talk to constituents as i do but for those who like it here in washington they like your money here too because my goodness they get to make the big decisions with it they get the lobbyist waiting outside their door who wants to take them out to lunch or dinner or on the trips and try to figure out how they can get their hands on that cash so if you like being a part of that sort of thing why keeping more of the american taxpayers cash in washington can be kind of exciting i am one who happens to have a wife and four children and before entering the united states congress was part of the free market economy and trying to run a small business i can tell you there is greater hopeand optimism and prosperity for the american people if we focus on americans rather than on government i want to talk also tonight again focusing on the conflict in vision that the two parties in washington have when it comes to taxes this is a quote from the president of the united states in buffalo new york just a couple of months ago talking about this budget surplus he was celebrating the surplus as many people in washington like to do here is what he said we could give it back the budget surplus we could give it all back to you and hope you spend it right but once again we could give it back to you and hope you spend it right but and the but was that we perhaps cannot hope that american taxpayers will spend it right excuse me but spend what right it here is the taxpayers money it does not belong to people in washington it is the hardearned wealth of the american people it is not something that rightfully belongs under the domain of politicians here in washington d c it does belong to the american people and it should be returned as soon as we possibly can the tax relief measure also includes a number of provisions for education tax relief specifically the bill expands the acceptable use of taxfree expenditures from education savings accounts to include elementary and secondary school expenses it increases to 2 000 annually from 500 under current law the maximum amount of contributions to education savings accounts it allows taxfree withdrawals from qualified tuition plans that are maintained by private educational institutions and it includes a public construction initiative when the family here who gets married and gets saddled with their 1 400 marriage tax penalty progresses in the maturity of their marriage and contemplate children and perhaps have them and send them to school they are also taxed to an additional degree education of course is a good thing i think everyone in congress would agree with that but there is no reason our tax burden should make it more difficult for families like this to secure a good quality education for their child or children and that is what this provision of the tax package is all about the other side will try to suggest that these are rich people here that they are wealthy and therefore somehow do not deserve the tax cut but these are average american families the same kind of average american families who benefit from our tax relief package we are providing tax relief to make greater education opportunity possible for millions and millions of american children we are doing that again by taking less out of the pockets of the families who work hard to earn it not doing as our opponents suggest of keeping those dollars hoarding them here in washington d c and controlling their use based upon the priorities of bureaucrats we stand for something very much different on the republican side of the aisle the tax measure also includes provisions that are designed to reform pensions and enhance retirement security specifically the bill increases portability of pensions so employers may roll over plans from one job to the next we provide additional salary catchup contributions for workers over the age of 50 these are individuals who may deposit additional amounts into certain retirement accounts the bill also lowers the vesting requirement of pension plans so employees are vested after 3 years instead of 5 it increases the contribution and benefit limits in defined contribution and benefit plans and it also simplifies pension systems to help businesses offer and improve their pension plans that is an important provision as i mentioned i mentioned the mcfarlands from fort collins colorado they are retirees again they say that the federal government should return any surplus to the taxpayers who worked all of their lives to earn it they want to know if i agree of course i do let me go back to the comments from mr ray in colorado he is asking for relief for retired persons living on pension income and that is what we are doing we are listening to people like mr ray real people average americans not wealthy not extraordinarily endowed with huge amounts of cash in their personal bank accounts but average americans earning average incomes or on average pensions those are the beneficiaries of the republican tax plan that we will vote on and presumably pass tomorrow the bill also reduces the individual capital gains tax rate from its current rate of 20 percent to 15 percent and from 10 percent to 7 5 percent those are for taxpayers in the 15 percent individual income tax bracket this is an important provision this is one that the president says he opposes lowering the taxes on those who invest those who create wealth helps the country create more wealth it almost does not matter what part of the country one lives in they are treated almost weekly to news headlines like these from colorado here is one from the denver post average income up 6 1 percent in colorado here is another one from the denver post a headline welfare rolls drop 42 percent here are some quotes from that article an article written by angela cortez she interviewed a woman named teri higgins who was a former welfare recipient and says that welfare reform has meant a new way of life after being on welfare for 3 years she is completely selfsufficient she was a fulltime student halfway through her associates degree in business administration when welfare reform kicked in nearly 2 years ago under the new system she had to work so she decided on a work study program at a community college in denver within a year the 37yearold single mother of three boys went from being a welfare recipient to the office manager in a business setting i will not cite the specific location but in a business setting in colorado she says listen to this quote this is remarkable a real statement of what a strong economy means for real people what made a difference were the extra things like gas vouchers day care so i could go to school and a lot of emotional support from counselors she once lived in a shelter with her children before entering the arapahoe county social services system she says she still struggles i make a decent wage but its still hard to make ends meet but when i sit down and write checks out for all my bills and everything is paid that is really a good feeling the specific components of welfare reform were certainly important but what makes these dramatic numbers possible this sea change and shift from welfare dependency to economic independence is not just the reform efforts but it is a strong economy the kind of strong economy that results from employers providing jobs that results from entrepreneurs making the kinds of investments that make our economy strong the kind of investments which we enjoy to a far greater degree when we unleash the economic ingenuity of the american people and reduce the tax burden that the american people are saddled with there is lots more workers coming off welfare to get job help economic success filters its way down to charities here is a story about how the strong economy in america is helping charities receive more funds because businesses are contributing more to communitybased charities that help people and are accountable to those folks back home in our districts jobless rate in colorado hits record low i point out all of these headlines because these headlines are the way we help see our democrats friends on the other side of the aisle believe in the principle that i showed you earlier not in personal freedom their goal and their vision is government control you see government can be very charitable government can help a lot of people when it takes your cash and spends it on the governmentrun charity of the politicians choice but personal freedom tax freedom greater amounts of liberty lower tax rates allows for american entrepreneurs allows for the free market to rise up and treat us still more to these wonderful headlines about former government dependents becoming selfsufficient and living the american dream and being treated as real americans there is more in this tax package it gradually eliminates the estate and gift tax over a 10year period also another topic important to me and my constituents back home in colorado my district consists of the eastern plains of the state 21 counties in colorado generally everything that is flat many people think of the mountains and the mountains that start right down the front range of the center of the state but everything east of that out to nebraska and kansas is part of the high prairie high plains and it is one of the richest agriculture areas on the planet many of the farms and ranches that have been established were established by homesteaders people who headed west in search of new opportunity and really led to the sense of rugged individualism and independence that represents the west and families like to pass their farms on down to their children family farmers look forward to that to leaving that legacy for their kids and the agricultural lifestyle of the west is something that all westerners are very proud of but when the old farmer starts to get old and have a difficult time working the land teaches his children how to manage the ag business and work the farm he eventually starts thinking about how he is going to hand that asset over to his children and keep that farm in the family the estate and gift tax makes that virtually impossible for many farmers and i know you in your district see a lot of farmers just as i do those who are confronted with the farm sale to sell parts of the farm off the equipment the inventory in order to pay the taxes in order to when a family member when the head of the household dies and tries to pass that farm on to his or her children this bill gradually eliminates the estate and gift tax over a 10year period let me state that again it eliminates the estate and gift tax not just tinker with it not just fiddle around the edges but envisions a day when we will no longer be taxed upon death the measure also includes provisions to make health care and longterm care more affordable and accessible for example the bill provides 100 percent deduction for health insurance premiums and longterm care insurance premiums now again i ask my colleagues to think about that for a moment you see back in world war ii when all of the young men were overseas fighting the war and winning we had a real work problem a labor shortage here in the united states the government imposed a wage freeze and employers had a hard time keeping people in the factories and it was at that point in time that the federal government the congress created section 106 of the irs tax code section 106 is that provision that says well you cannot at the time cannot increase wages but we can make it easy for you to provide this benefit of health insurance for your employees we will give you 100 percent deductibility if your business is large enough small business owners did not get that benefit neither did their employees but we believe fully that any contribution any investment that an employer whether you are a large employer or a small one makes into a health insurance program for their employees should not also be taxed on that investment they should receive 100 percent deduction for health insurance premiums now this will go a long way to helping health insurance become more affordable more available for more people in the workforce than those who have a difficult time affording health insurance today and once again i want to contrast this value with those or with that which is represented by our democrat friends over on the other side of the aisle my colleagues may recall that the first lady had proposed to socialize the health care industry in the united stafes to have government basically run health care and run one gigantic insuranceproviding mechanism for the american people well that idea was rejected as being somewhat ludicrous thank goodness for that because the sentiments of the american people are in quite the opposite direction the american people realize that if you tax employers less if you tax health care coverage less if you remove the tax burdens on those who wish to provide health insurance for themselves and their families guess what you will have more health insurance coverage for yourself for your families for employees the bill also provides an additional exemption which is currently at 2 750 for individuals who care for the elderly and who care for elderly family members in their homes it expands the availability of medical savings accounts and makes these medical savings accounts permanent and it allows employers to offer longterm care insurance to cafeteria plans now some of our democrat friends on the other side of the aisle and you did not have to listen very long just a few minutes ago to hear them say that the tax cuts in the republican bill favor the rich well this is what they are talking about those tax cuts which are designed to make it easier for employers to provide health insurance for their employees to make it easier for those individuals who stay home to take care of elderly family members those are the rich people that they speak of with such venom and such disdain but it is these employers who are providing the jobs these employers who would like to offer higher incomes that would like to offer greater benefits that would like to offer health insurance coverage for more employees and a better insurance product perhaps sometimes the barrier is simply the expense the expense of the federal government the cost of being an american citizen we want to lower that we want to lower that to help real people average families real citizens who are working very hard today and every day and sending too muchmoney to the federal government under the present set of circumstances the bill also authorizes the housing and urban development secretary to designate 20 renewal communities in both urban and rural areas allowing them to qualify for special tax incentives now these renewal communities are communities that are designed to help those who seek lowincome housing these provisions are designed to create jobs stimulate investment and assist families in impoverished neighborhoods now once again if you look at who gets the special tax incentive it is really not the individual who moves into the lowincome housing unit it is the developer and the construction people who build that renewal community who actually do the construction so from the democrats perspective this looks like a rich person getting a tax break but in reality we are talking about 20 new communities around the country in urban and rural settings where lowincome families will have the new hope the new promise of housing and home ownership an opportunity that today they do not have under our present high tax system the provision also phases out the bill also phases out the alternative minimum tax for both individuals and corporations it extends the number of expiring tax credits including the research and development tax credit for 5 years through june 2004 the work opportunity and the welfare to work tax credit through december 2001 again the welfare to work tax credit here is another tax that our democrat friends will say goes to rich people in america what is the welfare to work tax credit well this is a tax credit that tries to achieve the goals that are implied in the name those individuals who help welfare recipients move out of welfare and into selfsufficiency the ultimate beneficiary of that transaction is not the employer exclusively the rich guy as the democrats would describe that entrepreneur the real beneficiaries are the people who have no jobs today those who are having a difficult time making transition from welfare to work those who have still not seen the benefits of the republican welfare reform initiative that was passed in 1994 and implemented at the state level across the country those are the individuals who still need our help still deserve our compassion and still need our attention providing this tax credit will put many many more back to work and once again treat them like real americans the bill also provides an abovetheline deduction for individuals currently individuals may under the provision individuals may take the deduction whether or not they itemize a deduction for prescription drug insurance coverage for medicare beneficiaries contingent upon certain medicare changes this suggests a bigger plan that we are moving toward once again the president announced that he wanted to dip into the social security savings the social security trust fund to pay for an additional entitlement additional benefit with respect to prescription drugs our idea is very different and that is to allow individuals to take a deduction whether or not they itemize for prescription drug coverage for those who are in the medicare program this means keeping those dollars in your pocket not sending them here to washington keeping those dollars in your pocket just think about that for a moment under the current law a taxpayer senior citizen sends their tax payments to the federal government they come here to washington we politicians sit around here and establish the priorities for the nation and if we decide it is prescription drugs then we will take the nations wealth and spend it on that particular priority on that given day and at the next election we will decide it is another priority and maybe we will change the priorities at that point in time to serve our election causes and we redistribute the wealth of the american people well that is just nuts as my colleagues know what we really ought to do is just not bring it here to washington in the first place let us just be efficient about it why do we not why do we not just leave that cash in the hands of those who have worked all of their lives people just like the mcfarlands who worked all of their lives to earn it leave it in their pockets let them spend it as they see fit let them spend it on a growing economy that helps us pay down the national debt quicker saves social security more completely and pay for those truly legitimate causes the federal government has constitutional jurisdiction over the provision also includes a number of revenue offset provisions accounting for approximately 5 billion over 10 years and that means that we will attempt to spend less in many areas eliminate a lot of waste in our government and a lot of other provisions that frankly the american people do not want and do not need and will never miss in order to help make this tax relief possible let me provide a little background for a moment do you remember when the republican party took the majority of the congress we did so on the basis of the contract with america 10 bold promises that we issued to the american people if elected we will deliver and bring to the house floor for a vote 10 various provisions one of those was the 1995 tax fairness and debt reduction act and that provided americans with comprehensive tax relief that bill included a 500 per child tax credit outlined measures to alleviate the marriage tax penalty it created taxfree american dream savings accounts it repealed the 1993 tax increase on social security benefits and provided a 50 percent exclusion for capital gains and we indexed that for inflation now these are tax provisions which many of which we already have but the president vetoed that measure and we had to try it again in 1997 we provided further additional tax relief we provided tax relief through the education saving accounts 1998 we passed a taxpayer relief act again reducing the tax burden on american families and giving americans new rights in defending themselves against the intrusive practices of the internal revenue service our 2000 budget proposal provided real leadership by setting aside dollars in our longterm budgets longterm budget to allow for tax relief to take place and did so while protecting social security protecting medicare increasing spending on our national defense and outlining a plan that allows us to create the best education system in the world now we have heard the president talk about the budget surplus we expect over the next 10 years to have approximately 3 trillion in surpluses here in washington those are dollars that the federal government receives over and above the expenditures of the federal government at that point in time it is a little bit complicated and confusing because some of those dollars are devoted directly to the social security trust fund or attributable to social security taxes those are dollars we do not want to touch we want to leave those dollars for social security in fact over that 10year period what the republican plan entails is providing a dollar of tax relief for every 2 of social security savings the president does not agree with us that we ought to lock that social security fund away put it aside and leave it exclusively for social security the president would prefer to spend a portion of those dollars reduce the size of the allowable tax relief package and increase the spending of the federal government and ultimately the size of the bureaucracy in washington d c let me talk about some of the provisions that i just enumerated and in perhaps a little bit more detail the bill provides for 534 2 billion in family tax relief over the next 10 years as i say i mentioned this earlier let me mention that number again 534 2 billion over the next 10 years for family tax relief now if one makes over 40 000 the democrats believe one is rich and believes that one should not earn one should not be able to save that additional income one should continue to send it here to washington d c so that it can be squandered and wasted and controlled by people here in washington well average families are the ones who benefit from the republican tax package that we will vote on tomorrow let me restate that it reduces the individual income tax rate by 10 percent over a 10year period think about what a 10 percent reduction in ones income tax obligation to the federal government will mean for many states for example the state of colorado is a perfect one the state income tax is indexed to the federal income tak rate so a reduction in federal income taxes corresponds to an equivalent reduction in ones state income taxes as well by the year 2009 our bill reduces the 15 percent 28 percent 31 percent 36 percent and 39 6 percent tax rates to 13 5 percent 25 2 percent 27 9 percent 32 4 percent 35 7 percent respectively those are the individual tax brackets of every american who earns income unless one is a very low income falls within one of those tax brackets let us use the 31 percent tax bracket as an example most americans are in that ballpark if one is paying 31 percent of ones income in taxes today next year we propose for 2001 from 2001 to 2004 we propose that that rate drop to 30 3 percent then from 2005 to 2007 to 29 5 percent in fiscal year 2008 we want that rate to drop to 28 7 percent and after 2009 we want that rate to drop to 27 9 percent it is a pretty substantial reduction about a 3 percent reduction in income taxes for individuals in that category i mentioned the student loan interest rates because i know there are many students today who are trying to finance their college education their college degrees through debt financing this congress passed legislation last year that affected the student loan interest rates somewhat there was a scheduled decrease in those interest rates we slowed that decrease a little bit it was not the best part of the bill certainly but nonetheless there is some attention being paid here in washington to the cost of financing college education we are going to adjust that student loan interest deduction for married couples who file joint returns to twice that of a single taxpayer so that the married couple that i showed you their photo of a little earlier those individuals will see some relief when they try to secure a greater education opportunity for themselves let me talk about the alternative minimum tax for a moment as well the bill reduces and phases in a repeal of the alternative minimum tax for individuals the bill accomplishes this by gradually reducing amt liability specifically beginning in the year 2003 only 80 percent of the full amt liability will be imposed the bill reduces this percentage to 70 percent in 2004 60 percent in 2005 50 percent in 2006 and 2007 and the tax is fully repealed after 2007 the repeal of the individual amt eliminates the present law marriage penalty in the individual amt the bill also makes permanent the provisions allowing nonrefundable personal tax credits to be used fully without regard to the amt this was originally designed to ensure that high income taxpayers pay some minimum tax and not escape their fair share of the income tax burden there will be a significant increase in the number of middleincome taxpayers subjected to the alternative minimum tax currently about 600 000 taxpayers are subject to the amt but estimates indicate that more than 20 million taxpayers will be subject to that tax by 2007 as i mentioned when it comes to savings and investment the republican tax package provides 77 1 billion in tax relief to encourage savings and investment over the next 10 years i mentioned capital gains taxes i think capital gains tax relief is a rather important topic to discuss this is the tax that is applied to increases in earnings the growth portion of investments that many people make sometimes it isa financial transaction sometimes it is the sale of property maybe ones home right now there is a 20 percent tax rate applied to that for most people some people in lower income tax brackets pay a lower tax but for most people that is a 20 percent application to any interest any financial growth that accrues as a result of the sale of an asset or so on as i mentioned that capital gains tax causes an awful lot of the nations wealth to go nonproductive to be held in nonproductive holdings nonproductive assets and those that could be generating more wealth for the american people i have actually met people who take their cash and put it in the proverbial under the mattress there are people who really do that sort of thing they are afraid of being hit by the capital gains tax rates of 20 percent and so they will do ridiculous things with that cash sometimes to avoid paying taxes they despise the irs that much alan greenspan the chairman of the federal reserve board estimated to the senate finance committee that there is approximately 11 trillion in capital private sector capital that is available in the economy and it is underutilized and that what congress should do is focus on a sound tax policy that encourages the american peopler to unleash a portion or all if possible of that 11 trillion into the free market economy imagine what that could do for the country well our imaginatioft does not have to be that long in duration because tomorrow this provision is slated for a vote on this floor that capital gains tax rate reduction is the tax that makes job creation possible it is that provision that portion of our tax code which encourages the kinds of investments that creates wealth creates opportunity allows individuals to become financially independent selfsufficient and to avoid the government dependency that many americans fear and seem to be trapped in today there is also a partial exclusion for interest and dividends the bill allows individuals to exclude up to 200 400 for married couples filing jointly of income earned in any given taxable year this provision is phased in and will take full effect in december of 2002 the current definition of gross income includes all income from whatever source derived that expands the net greatly from the current law thus it makes no exceptions for smaller amounts of savings and investment income earned by taxpayers that when subject to the tax rate of most small investors discourages savings and investment for low and middle income taxpayers once again this is a provision that our democrat friends will try to suggest applies only to the wealthy but as we can see we are talking very plainly about average middleincome taxpayers the kind of people that go to work every day go to work work hard come home raise their children maintain their families go to church get involved in the softball game on the h6002 co weekends and go back to work and do it all again those are the folks we are reaching out to i mentioned school construction before that is another provision of the tax bill we want to encourage school construction let me elaborate a little bit on that component of the tax package h r 2488 increases to 4 years the period during which a state or local government may avoid paying arbitrage rebates to the federal government on public school construction bonds under the current law state and local governments may issue taxexempt bonds to finance school construction activities as well as a variety of other public facilities and services the prcceeds from those bonds may be invested but state and municipal governments must pay profits to the federal government this revenue must be repaid to the federal government in 5year intervals however certain bonds qualify for exemption from repayments in the case of school construction bonds the current law requires that money from the sale of the bonds must be spent within 24 months of their sale 1n the following increments 10 percent of the bond revenue must be spent within the first 6 months of being issued 45 percent must be spent within the first 12 months 75 percent within the first 18 months and 100 percent within the first 2 years our bill expands this interval period to a total of 4 years and finally the bill increases the amount of governmental bonds for public schools that localities may issue without being subject to the arbitrage rebate requirement from 5 million to 10 million the bill is designed to give school districts greater flexibility when issuing bonds in building public schools let me focus on that for a moment because once again we hear the president and many of our friends on the democrat side of the aisle talking about investing in our local schools and in our local communities and once again their vision involves having the american taxpayers work hard pay more taxes than they need to and send those dollars here to washington d c so that members of congress andlobbyists and bureaucrats from over at the white house can all get together and decide how those funds will be redistributed across america to help the people that they want to help so the dollars come to washington a certain portion of those are lost and wasted in the transaction a smaller portion of those dollars go back to our states those states that are privileged to receive those dollars back to construct schools and to be spent on worthwhile endeavors our solution is much different our solution is to leave that money back home in the first place to reduce the tax burden on the investments that are made to help finance the construction of schools not only does it make more"], [0.014891266822814941, 0.9851087331771851, 1, "h r 4051 is another smoke screen for the

what the last couple weeks were like when i was back home spending time with my constituents during the district work period conducting 15 town meetings and i wanted to report today on really the response to the republican agenda of good schools and low taxes and a secure retirement for all americans i have the privilege of representing a very very diverse district the south side of chicago in the south suburbs of cook and will counties as well as a lot of rural and bedroom communities and one always listens for the common concerns when they represent a diverse district of cities suburbs and country during the last two weeks i got a pretty good response people were very supportive of the republican agenda of strengthening our local schools of lowering the tax burden for the middle class of making for a secure retirement for all americans by strengthening medicare and social security i would like to take a few minutes just to talk about some of those specifics of our republican agenda and of course let me begin with the republican efforts to strengthen social security and to strengthen medicare for the next three generations i am often asked a common question over the last several years that i have had the privilege of being in the congress and that question is when are you politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund i was pleased to tell my constituents that this is the year we are going to do that this is the year we are going to wall off the social security trust fund and say hands off and my constituents frankly were pretty shocked when they learned that the clintongore budget actually raids the social security trust fund by 351 billion i think it is important to note that when we compare republican efforts to wall off the social security trust fund which means 100 percent of social security according to this chart for social security versus the clintongore proposal for 62 percent of the social security trust fund going to social security and the other 38 percent being spent on other things that is what this means the president wants to spend 38 percent of social security on new government programs republicans of course want to wall off the social security trust fund essentially putting trust back in the trust fund with 100 percent of social security for social security and that is a big victory i also want to note that the republican budget sets aside almost 400 billion more than the clintongore budget for medicare and social security now our second priority in our agenda of course is lower taxes for the middle class and i am one who believes that when the tax burden for the average family in illinois is about 40 percent of their income going to local state and federal government for taxes that that tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden particularly for the middle class and when we talk about the tax burden i find that constituents whether it is at the union hall or the vfw or the local chamber of commerce they tell me that the tax code is too complicated requires too much paperwork and the majority of people have to hire someone else to fill out the tax forms and i also point out that the tax burden is really unfair as we work this year to lower the tax burden i believe that our top priority should be to simplify the tax code to address the unfairness in the tax code and of course we need to begin by eliminating the marriage tax penalty is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple living together outside a marriage that is wrong that our tax code punishes marriage the marriage tax elimination act has 230 cosponsors let us get it done this year let us simplify the tax code and eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the republican agenda a secure retirement and lower taxes also includes strengthening our local schools and we want to strengthen our local schools by empowering our local school boards and our local teachers and our local parents to run their schools and giving them the flexibility of course to meet the needs of local communities and that is an important shift because previously for 30 to 40 years all the power was moving to washington and i talk with local school administrators and school board members they tell me maybe in illinois 6 percent of our public schools budget comes from washington but so does twothirds of the paperwork and almost 100 percent of the mandates micromanaging how our schools are run we want to let local schools run themselves and meet the needs of their local communities and that is why we want to pass the ed flex legislation my hope it will be on the presidents desk fairly soon the other concern that local school board members also share with me is they say as my colleagues know youve increased funding at the federal level by 10 percent even while youve been balancing the budget increasing funding for education but if you look at how those dollars have been spent only 70 cents of every dollar actually reaches the classroom thirty cents is lost in the washington bureaucracy our goal is to ensure that more dollars get to the classroom with a goal of 95 cents on the dollar reaching the classroom and if we compare that to the current cost of delivering those funds to our looal schools that is a 25 percent funding increase above and beyond what they are currently receiving we are providing 22 billion in federal funding for our local schools it is just wrong that 30 cents on the dollar currently is lost in washington let us help our local schools let us lower the tax burden for the middle class let us secure retirement by strengthening medicare and social security"], [0.015536248683929443, 0.9844637513160706, 1, "i rise in strong opposition to the republican budget resolution in order to make room for 150 billion of irresponsible tax cuts the republicans cut budget authority for nondefense discretionary programs by a total of 138 billion over 5 years below the baseline needed to maintain program levels as a result this would among other things cut 310 000 lowincome women infants and children off wic assistance in 2001 alone and more in years thereafter cut 1 000 fbi agents and 800 drug enforcement agents by 2005 cut liheap to only 164 000 low income families in 2001 just as oil prices are skyrocketing provide pell grants to 316 000 fewer lowincome students by 2005 eliminate head start for more than 40 000 children and their families by 2005 and raid the social security surplus to pay for its tax cuts it is time for the republicans to stop trying to cut taxes on the backs of americas seniors working families and children it is also time for the republicans to stop claiming that we cant afford to spend more on important programs like education and health when they are pouring more and more money into defense we have 11 million children who are not covered by health insurance we have a head start program so chronically underfunded that only 2 out of every 5 eligible children can get in and we have 26 000 schoolsserving 14 million kids that need major repair or replacement this past fall 53 2 million unitedstates students returned to school for the fourth year in a row we set a record for enrollment rates447 000 more children than last year and public high school enrollment is expected to increase by 11 percent between 1998 and 2008on top of a 16 percent jump since 1988 schools are straining to accommodate the influx of students setting up classrooms in trailers hallways and closets the unitedstates department of education estimates that 6 000 new schools must be built by 2006 at a cost of billions of dollars to handle this overflow yet the republicans have chosen to cut nondefense discretionary spending like education furthermore 46 percent of todays schools lack adequate electrical wiring to support the fullscale use of technology and our schools are still suffering from a digital divide schools with 90 percent or more of minority students have less access to computers17 students per computer compared with only 10 students per computer in schools with less than 25 percent minority students yet instead of focusing on these important issues the republicans are increasing defense spending by 17 4 billion the biggest percentage increase in the dod budget 11 percent is not for what is really needed like pay raises or operations and maintenance countless numbers of our soldiers are on food stamps but the republican budget focuses more on building new weapons than helping to retain our soldiers and to improve their quality of life our longterm national security depends not just on how many bombs and missiles we build but how well we can retain our soldiers and how we can prepare our children for the highlycompetitive global economy they will face the democratic alternative focuses on these important issues it focuses on the needs of americans by extending the solvency of both social security and medicare and protecting 100 percent of the social security surplus providing a voluntary prescription drug benefit for all schools through medicare and issuing reconciliation instructions to the ways and means committee to make it real providing more debt reduction than the republican budget by not spending all of the onbudget surplus the democratic alternative maintains onbudget surpluses for the next ten years unlike the republican budget thus the entire debt would be eliminated by 2013 under the democratic alternative maintaining funding for nondefense discretionary programs at the level needed to adjust for inflation providing targeted tax cuts to average families of 78 billion over five years and 263 billion over ten years and offsetting this cost by closing corporate loopholes and shutting down corporate tax shelters and by including initiatives to extend access to health care and health insurance and reforming the health care system for military retirees what we do in this budget will affect more than what we do next yearit will affect what we do years down the road we must prepare for our future we must provide security for our seniors we must support our working families and we
