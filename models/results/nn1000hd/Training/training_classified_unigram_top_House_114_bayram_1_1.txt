greeks were slaughtered by the ottoman empire in the first genocide of the 20th century the sheer scale of genocide thwarts our capacity to comprehend it 1 5 million armenians killed 6 million jews killed in the holocaust 1 million tutsis the numbers become abstractions sanitized by their enormity it is only when we consider each of those lives individually that the full horror comes into focus the victims of genocide are more than victimsthey are human beings the armenians massacred from 1915 to 1923 were men women and children who were targeted in what was then an unprecedented campaign to wipe out an entire people it is our duty in the modern day to remember those lost and to bear witness that the campaign to destroy the armenian people failed we do so by speaking the truth and we do so by speaking the names of those 1 5 million and by keeping both the way they lived and the way they died alive in our memory earlier this month i asked my thousands of armenian constituents and millions of armenians around the country and the world to submit the names and stories of their family members who were killed 100 years ago the response was overwhelming thousands of people sent the names and stories of ancestors killed in the genocidethe names of infants and toddlers ripped from their mothers arms the names of children and the elderly dying of exhaustion and starvation on a forced march to deir ezzor the names of women and girls raped and brutalized and killed the names of clergy tortured and burned alive in their own churches the names of men robbed of their possessions of their homes and of their lives each victim has a name and a story from glendale to yerevan to jordan and every corner of the world where armenian diaspora lives families sent me those names and those stories it is my honor to read some of those names this hour knowing that it would take more than 1 000 hours more than 50 days to read all of them turkey may deny the genocide our administration may lack the courage to recognize the genocide our congress may lack the courage to recognize the genocide but no one can deny the humanity of its victims and no one can deny our right to speak the truth one hundred years ago 1 5 million armenians were killed in the armenian genocide these are their names george tutunjian harutsun minasian samuel kadiyan dikran karakashian manoug

contemplation we have had plenty of times to pause and reflect we have had more than enough moments of silence the time to be silent has passed now it is time to act my colleagues and i held a sitin here on this house floor 3 weeks ago to demand a vote on solutions to gun violence we were not engaging in some kind of stunt we were not seeking publicity we were speaking for the american people who have simply had enough they have had enough gun violence they have had enough moments of silence and they have had enough carnage and devastation the orlando shooting was the latest in a seemingly endless series of horrific mass shootings that have shocked us all all of which we agree in hindsight were committed by people who should not have had access to a gun the individual in orlando had committed horrible acts of violence against his exwife he exhibited such derangement and rage that he frightened classmates and coworkers he was even investigated as a potential terrorist by the fbi he was in nearly every respect the very last person we would want to be able to have a gun walk into a gun store and legally purchase an assault weapon a glock and a massive amount of ammunition he did not violate any laws in the purchase of these weapons because the laws we have are not good enough doing nothing is not rational it is madness it is folly and it is wrong the american people expect and deserve real action not toothless half measures engineered to silence the people trying to solve this problem please no more games and no more inaction just give us a vote on real reform

have 247 votes house democrats only 188 and not every democrat might even vote for these bills with the 59member majority the republican progun position would certainly prevail or would it how many moderate republicans in swing districts might actually vote against their constituents desires or vote for their constituents desires we cited polls again and again that 85 percent of americans dont want people on the terrorist watch list to be able to buy guns and 90 percent of unitedstates citizens want to close the background check loopholes this is what political scientists call a tough vote vote for your constituents and you are in trouble with the nra vote your conscience and you are in big trouble with the republican leadership and if you toe the nra line the most extreme position you can be sure your democratic proponent will let all voters know this fall that you voted with the terrorists yes a tough vote do what is right and moral and sensible and just and you are in political

those are h r 1644 the stream act h r 3662 the iran terror finance transparency act and s j res 22 a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the epa and army corps of engineers rule relating to the definition of waters of the united states under the clean water act the rule provides for consideration of h r 1644 under a structured rule making four amendments in order three from the democrats and one from the republicans h r 3662 under a closed rule and s j res 22 also under a closed rule like many americans i have grave concerns about the administrations nuclear agreement with iran since the agreements adoption in july iran has shown no goodwill or intention of improving its relationship with the west in many ways the iranian regime has increased its aggressive attitude toward the united states and our allies against u n security council resolutions the rogue nation has expanded its ballistic missile program testing two missiles as recently as last fall just on december 26 an iranian military ship fired a rocket near unitedstates and french military vessels in the persian gulf these incidents occurred just months before crippling international sanctions against the country are scheduled to be lifted further iran continues to be a state sponsor of terrorism a direct threat to our closest ally in the region israel continues rampant human rights abuses and continues the wrongful imprisonment of five american citizens president obama and senior administration officials have claimed that the nuclear agreement and lifting of economic sanctions which could return as much as 100 billion in frozen assets to tehran will help iran down a more moderate path however reality appears to show the contrary is occurring just weeks after the deal was signed supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei stated that we wont allow american political economic or cultural influence in iran and just last week the supreme leader told a gathering of prayer leaders that americans have set their eyes covetously on elections but the great and vigilant nation of iran will act contrary to the enemies will whether it be in elections or on other issues and as before will punch them in the mouth while president obama may find something positive in irans actions and statements i believe congress owes it to the american people to view iran with skepticism and concern h r 3662 the iran terror finance transparency act requires the president to certify that those individuals and entities receiving sanctions relief under the iranian nuclear deal are not involved in irans support for terrorism its human rights abuses or its ballistic missile program by passing this legislation congress can help ensure that the unitedstates will continue to sanction and deter terrorism and illegal ballistic missile tests within the state of iran in arguing for the nuclear deals adoption the president committed to congress and to the american people that our sanctions on iran for its support of terrorism its human rights abuses its ballistic missile program will continue to be fully enforced this legislation gives us the opportunity to hold the president to his word and conduct the necessary oversight to ensure that sanctions are enforced additionally this rule will provide for consideration of two other very critical measures that will help protect american businesses and families from the administrations regulatory overreach this rule provides for consideration of h r 1644 legislation that was drafted in response to the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcements ongoing rulemaking process that seeks to govern the interaction between surface mining operations and streams it is commonly referred to as the stream buffer zone rule in december 2008 the outgoing bush administration published its final stream buffer zone rule this rule was the product of over 5 years of deliberation extensive scientific research environmental analyses public comment and a concurrence from the environmental protection agency put simply this rule was developed the right way with transparency unbiased research scientific integrity stakeholder engagement and most importantly public involvement however shortly after the final 2008 rule was released several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the osm ultimately leading to a settlement agreement between osm and the environmental groups after numerous missed deadlines the environmental organizations renewed the litigation the administration agreed with the complaint as a result the court vacated the 2008 rule and osm subsequently restarted the rulemaking process since that time the entire process has lacked transparency oversight conducted by the house committee on natural resources of which i am a member revealed that the settlement agreements expedited timeframe coupled with an inexperienced contractor and gross mismanagement of the rulemaking process resulted in major issues with the administrations rule now this may sound just a little familiar it is the very same sue and settle practice that the house addressed just last week with the passage of h r 712 the sunshine for regulatory decrees and settlements act the outcome is another example of why sue and settle leads to poor rulemakings and onerous regulations that significantly harm the people businesses and jobs they are supposed to be supporting backroom deals between environmental groups and federal agencies do not lead to sound regulations but instead circumvent the rulemaking process to serve the interest of a select few namely special interests and environmental groups for 6 years osm has been rewriting this rule and the ongoing process has now cost the taxpayers over 10 million though this is only a small fraction of the cost it will have on businesses and hardworking american families the stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access to coal which accounts for nearly half of our countrys electricity leading to higher electricity costs and significant job losses according to a study from the national mining association the number of direct mining jobs that could be lost is between 40 000 and 77 000 and the total job losses is between 112 000 and 280 000 a fact that is underscored by the nations second largest oil company arch coal filing for bankruptcy largely due to the increased cost of federal regulations that happened just this week for these reasons it is imperative that we pass h r 1644 legislation that delays the rules implementation increases scientific transparency for rulemakings affecting mining directs a transparent third party to evaluate the existing stream buffer zone rule and reduces duplicative regulation this rule also makes in order legislation dealing with an issue that i hear about very often in my congressional district it strikes the controversial waters of the united states or wotus rule s j res 22 is a resolution of disapproval of the presidents wotus rule that was passed by the senate in bipartisan fashion and it is now time for the house to consider and pass this important measure this legislation was crafted in response to the wotus rule promulgated by the epa and the army corps of engineers which redefines and vastly expands the scope of water subject to federal jurisdiction under the clean water act by issuing this rule these agencies have given themselves broad new power over water and land across the united states like many of my constituents i am very concerned with this massive federal overreach it goes far beyond the agencies statutory authority and could impose significant costs not only on american farmers and small businesses but on states and local governments the rule is another federal power grab that has more to do with controlling land use decisions than protecting access to clean water s j res 22 utilizes the congressional review act to block this harmful regulation and it is time to send this critical measure to the presidents desk i urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation and the rule providing for its consideration the rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of three bills that are critically important for the future of this country we must pass h r 1644 and s j res 22 to protect american families and businesses from the rampant executive overreach that will be the defining achievement of the obama administration furthermore the united states must stand with our allies in the middle east as well as around the world in the face of growing iranian aggression which threatens not only the stability of the region but the strength of unitedstates alliances and standing in the world i stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the obama administrations shortsighted nuclear agreement does not unravel decades of work by the unitedstates

only developed nation on the planet that cannot protect its families from gun violence obviously there are no simple solutions in a nation where there is a gun for every adult where a halfdozen people have been killed in recent years by their pets and even babies kill parents and their siblings with guns too many people feel that more guns and fewer protections is the solution obscuring the fact that the overwhelming majority of the american public agrees that there are things we can do and that it is irresponsible and cynical not to try for more than 24 hours last week my democratic colleagues and i discussed many of these solutions on the floor of the house demanding action on three for instance over 90 percent of the american public and a majority of gun owners agreed that there should be no anonymous secret purchases of weapons there should be a universal background check people who cannot buy firearms at a gun store should not be able to buy guns over the internet or at gun shows anonymously the american public supports us in our efforts to make it harder for people the government has deemed too dangerous to buy a plane ticket to purchase assault weapons and it is past time to eliminate the outrageous prohibition against the centers for disease control to even study the epidemic of gun violence that kills three or four americans every hour these solutions are not really that hard they would be a signal that we are serious about trying to change the gun violence equation that kills about 90 people every day i returned to oregon last week and had encouraging meetings with dozens of people who have been leading the charge in my home state who are redoubling their efforts they have demonstrated that steps can be taken through the political process and are committed to building upon their commonsense actions for example they led the charge to prevent people with a history of domestic violence and restraining orders from purchasing guns the oregon legislature finally enacted universal background checks like we are seeking at the federal level and the oregon house of representatives even passed legislation last session that would have closed the socalled charleston loophole where law enforcement has a 10day delay for a purchase if the police are unable to determine that purchasers qualifications i was impressed and encouraged that these ordinary citizens so devoted to this cause are committing to taking on the issue further at the state and local level and making it an issue in the political elections in the fall wherever they can it is only that type of activity that will overcome the inertia the temerity and the cynicism of people who are apologists for gun violence the same way we embarked upon a decadeslong crusade to reduce traffic fatalities that cut that death rate in half we need to embark on a similar crusade to reduce gun violence the members who took to the floor over 24 hours showed a powerful expression of policy and emotion that used to be seen on the floor of this house but is sadly seldom in evidence today but it is not too late congress should do its part to at least allow the issue the attention and the

i introduced earlier this congress is included as title ii of the bill the constituents that i represent in northeast texas work hard every day to provide for their families and to contribute to their communities but i can tell you from countless conversations that they are fed up with a federal government that has been invading every aspect of their lives they are frustrated with unaccountable

little time to prepare and implement them in some cases regulators are unforgiving to those who either cant or dont timely comply by imposing criminal penalties now lets pause to think about that

breaking immigration laws giving early release to tens of thousands of prisonersviolent criminalsand turning loose radical islamic terrorists from guantanamo it is little wonder that my constituents are outraged and if it were up to this administration the problem would get worse not better to underscore that point we need only look at the federal register where agencies publish their mandates that document contained 82 000 pages last year meaning that this administration averaged more than 224 pages of new regulations every day of the year americans have every right to demand to know what we are doing here in congress to stop them from being crushed by this snowball of regulations part of the answer should be that current law requires an update twice a year on federal regulations being developed by federal agencies but guess what under this administration these updates have either been late or not issued at all and until now there hasnt been a way to hold these unelected bureaucrats accountable my bill does just that this bill forces the executive branch to make the american people aware of regulations that are coming down the track and it prohibits any regulations from going into effect unless and until detailed information on the cost of that regulationits impact on jobs and the legal bases for itis made available to the public for at least 6 months predictably the

years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of

loopholes and pays for making this tax credit permanent with this bill alone republicans will explode the deficit by 182 billion this is just a part of a larger package of permanent completely unpaidfor republican tax measures this year that will add almost 600 billion to the deficitover half a trillion dollars added to the deficitincluding this bill their bill to hand 269 billion to the 5 400 richest families in america 5 400 families and their estate tax bill would be getting the benefit of 269 billion paid for by the middle class in our country depriving us of investments in our childrens future the fact is that house republicans have spent this entire congress blowing up the deficit with unpaidfor tax giveaways overwhelmingly tilted toward wealthy special interests my colleagues hear this it is worth noting that this bill on the floor has nothing to do with enterprising startups that are unable to claim the r d tax credit some of you have said to me well we have all these startups in my district by and large they cannot benefit from this bill the way it is written we would like to have written our motion to recommit to go further to do that but the parliamentarians say because you prevent it in your base bill we cant go further this is what is really stunning in the look of it all on the same day as you are saying we are going to do a gotcha bill on r d and challenge you all who support r d not to vote for our approach on the very same daylest anybody think that this is an overwhelming interest in r d on the republican side of the aislerepublicans are bringing to the floor a competes act that completely undermines everything to do with science and innovation in our country it completely upsets our innovation agenda in the 110th congress we put forth the innovation agenda a bill developed in a totally nonpartisan way anna eshoo zoe lofgren and george miller took the lead going across the country getting input nonpartisan input academic input venture capital input technological input into an innovation agenda that innovation agenda really calls for making permanent and modernizing the r d tax credit we see the relationship between science technology innovation and progress to keep america number one with r d tax credits but not done this way as we do here this is a trap in order to keep us from investing in innovation agenda and that was something that bart gordon as chair of the science and technology committee fought for and achieved arpae you know that to name one thing but instead today republicans are bringing a bill that totally does violence to all this i hope members will listen to and support the alternative presented by congresswoman eddie bernice johnson our ranking member on the committee but anyway the original competes act by the democratic congress was supported by an overwhelming number of republicans a majority of the republicans defied their leadership and voted for the competes act in the 110th congress and that original bill passed in a bipartisan way we laid the foundation for new industries that provide jobs for our workers that open new markets for american products that ensure that we continue to rise above the gathering storm norm augustine and others led the way to show what the gathering storm was unless we made those investments in science and technology as i said we created arpae so important this republican bill betrays everything that the competes act did the republican bill betrays everything that the competes act did it is an assault on science and a plan to surrender american leadership on innovation instead of investing in research and development their bill slashes funding for essential initiatives at the national science foundation the national institute of standards and technology the office of science and technology policy the department of energy research it cuts energy efficiency and renewable energy r d by 496 million it is huge halfabilliondollar cut nearly 30 percent below what was appropriated last year it cuts arpae by 140 million 50 percent below the level in the energy and water appropriations bill passed last week most insidiously republicans are attacking science they dont even want to hear just because you dont want to hear it doesnt mean it isnt true in this competes bill that they are presenting they are trying to silence the climate environmental and social science they have consistently tried to ignore the republican bill goes so far as to forbid federal agencies such as epa and ferc from using any research funded or developed by doe a brazen attempt to divorce their decisions from scientific inquiry so again the very idea that on this floor today they come out with this masquerade of r d tax credits 182 billion added to the deficit with the impression that they care about r d r d into what r d into nothing that is about innovation to keep america number one these republican bills represent a perfect manifestation of republican trickledown economics the choice that our country has to make in the economy as we go forward is trickledown economics versus middle class economics trickledown theories have not worked they are what got us in trouble in 2008 and it is exactly what the republicans are trying to take us back to today is one manifestation of that republicans are seeking to ransack our nations investments in the future our commitment to science our commitment to our childrens education our commitment to bigger paychecks and our commitment to better infrastructure for every american family we need to come together in a bipartisan way and that is very possible we did it with the competes act before to pay for r d tax credit extension we need to reject this republican assault on science that will happen later today we need to invest in the future of innovation of our country of hardworking american families we need to reject failed trickledown economic theories and accept that the success of our nation depends on bigger paychecks for americas working families r d tax credits made permanent and modernized are a significant part of that but they are not a part of it if they take us deeper into debt preventing us from making the investments in the future i urge my colleagues to vote no on this fiscally irresponsible r d bill no on their destructive competes act and yes on the proposal made by congresswoman eddie bernice johnson who i thank for her great leadership for keeping america number one"], [0.039840877056121826,

have worked together with the congressional hispanic caucus we have worked together with the congressional black caucus and we have worked together with the democratic caucus i rise today to encourage the entire house to be committed to the very values of this nation this should not be a republican or democratic issue of which it has become we stand here as democrats arguing for the empowerment of voters all over the nation yet legislative initiatives have been introduced by members of the judiciary committee and others i have joined a number of those legislative initiatives and these initiatives cannot be heard and cannot be voted on the american people need to know that there is no other reason than the republican majority does not want to have empowered voters this is unlike what we did in years past i have had the privilege of being on the house judiciary committee for a number of years and the most powerful and moving experience wasand there have been many experiences on the house judiciary committeewhen all of us came together to help write the restoration or reauthorization of the 1965 voting rights act 1815 it was a very emotional and tearful moment it was a moment of great extensiveness15 000 pages of testimony many many many witnesses individuals explaining how precious it is to vote but more importantly how not having protection for the vote can therefore disallow them to vote i guess the most provocative experience was a republican president being joined by republican and democratic members on a joyful sunny day signing the legislation that reauthorized the voting rights act of 1965 mind you that bill exhibits if you will the pain and suffering of so many who marched and marched and marched and marched not only did they march they died like jimmie lee jackson or our own colleague from georgia john lewis who reminds us every day of the fear and feeling of being beaten near to death in his march across the edmund pettus bridge in selma alabama he also reminds us how precious the right to vote is when dr martin luther king who refused to give up or give out or give in marched again and they made itwith so many people from all backgrounds and all over the nationto montgomery alabama on that fateful trip back everyone was celebrating that they had marched for the voting rights act that they had gotten through without violenceattributable of course to a texas president by the name of lyndon baines johnson when a wonderful wonderful ladywhose children i had the privilege of meetingwas driving back some foot soldiers whom we will honor shortly at the leadership of terri sewell when they were driving back and viola liuzzo was behind the wheel lo and behold somebody violently took a gun and killed her voting has never been easy voting rights has never been easy a lot of blood was shed it baffles me why we are faced with a situation where the united states supreme court eliminated section 5not an illegal provision but a provision that somebody disliked because i believe it empowered voters what the congress was tasked to do by the court which i think incorrectly and wrongly ignored 15 000 pages of testimony ignored tens upon tens of witnesses in a meticulous rewriting of the voting rights act to prove that it was still necessary in a skewed deliberation the supreme court decided to reject it indicating that it was long passe and of course some brilliant legislators used the example because we have eliminated polio because of the vaccination is it appropriate to get rid of the vaccination no it is not so with that skewed and if i might use the term weird reasoning we are left holding the bag and the door is open to the kinds of laws such as voter id laws that spread across america like a contagious disease because we did not have the protection of section 5 which the idea of section 5 was a preclearance for men and women of goodwill to look and determine whether or not a procedure was going to block individuals from voting of course the voter id law from texas sprung up you will soon hear from the gentleman from texas my dear friend and colleague because he was in fact the leader on the lawsuit let me say that that terrible law blocked a lot of people from voting i want to remind people that the day of august 6 1965 in the presence of such luminaries as the reverend dr martin luther king roy wilkins of the naacp whitney young of the national urban league james forman of the congress of racial equality a philip randolph john lewis robert kennedy hubert humphrey and everett dirksenmind you a lady was missing but in the event many women were foot soldiers the point was made on the voting rights act the vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men in this instance i would modify it and say women when the voting id lawbecause of the misgivings of the state of texas and its legislaturewas put in place there were 80 counties at least in texas that did not have a department of public safety office for individuals to be able to register or to be able to get an id that is a tragedy each moment there is something coming out of texas that wants to in essence put down the rights of individuals to vote one case that should be brought to our attention is a case before the supreme court that indicates a group of petitioners who dont like the fact that you represent a population of people so they want to characterize and get a definition of what a person means and they want to make that person be an eligible voter so in essence a sick person laying in a bed who needs health care and needs to be represented is not an eligible voter or a senior citizen that has gotten so old and feeble that they may not have been registered because of their illness and their feebleness but they need to be represented or it may be a childhispanic african american anglo or asianwho is not at the age of voting and they are not an eligible voter or as i know they are focusing on is hardworking individuals who happen to be immigrants and they are not yet eligible to vote and this case is brought primarily to make sure that those people who need to be represented to the extent that they are taxpayers but are not yet status they will not be counted this case is not anything to do with voter fraud these people are not trying to vote they are just trying to survive but you are telling me that they are human beings and this case is suggesting that they cannot be represented this is the devastating impact of not having voter protection in section 5 so i rise today to ensure that it is heard throughout the land we can pass voter restoration voter advancement we can pass fixing the voting rights act and restoring section 5 there are many people in this congress who previously were here when we stood with president bush a republican and republicans and democrats 981 982 in the senate massive support in the house to restore the voting rights act let me ask the question mr speaker why now why are we struggling in this presidential year not to allow people to vote let me close my remarks because we could go on withhow should i say itthe irony and as well the wrongness of not passing legislation but let me say this in closing redistricting is a result of the voting rights act those of us in texas are still in litigationfor 20 years some of uson the question of redistricting and making fair districts where all people are represented and the gerrymandering that has been done that disallows and disenfranchises whole chunks of minorities disallowing them from voting for the person of their choice do you know what it brings about it brings about this house in the majoritygood friends of minehaving the sheer gall to deny the presidents representative of the office of management and budget to present the presidents budget in its 41year history that has never happened but because we have these districts that are drawn not representing the vast numbers of people who should be able to hear the presidents

of the skewed redistricting that allows for the majority to be so overwhelmingly in charge that they would deny the normal processes of government the voting rights act and the empowerment of voters is crucial and a fair redrawing of lines to let all of the people be heard and all of the voters be able to speak that is why i am on the floor today i am looking forward to reasonable people coming

and will wind up on the presidents desk that is the vision i believe of many republicans and democrats in and out of this house as well it is the vision of the presidents but more importantly it is the vision of suffering families who do not have their loved ones with them the reason we must work together is that the leading killer of americans today which is drug overdose started first by prescription use in many instances between 2000 and 2014 almost half a million people died from drug overdoses that is a startling number in 2014 alone more than 47 000 people died of drug overdoses the largest percentage of overdose deaths in 2014 was attributed to opioids like prescription painkillers methadone morphine and heroin specifically 28 647 people overdosed and died because of an opioid in 2014 this is an emergency and it is a combination of prescription painkillers and heroin prescription painkillers abuse is the strongest risk for the future use of heroin that is our athletes or those who have had surgeryjust everyday americans who find themselves caught in the trap of addiction approximately three out of four new heroin users report that their use began with the abuse of prescription drugs heroin use becomes appealing to those who are addicted to prescription drugs because it is cheaper and easier to obtain and due to its potency heroin use tends to lead to addiction we know that from the 1980s and 1990s with crack cocaine in that crack was a more potent extraction of cocaine and we saw many of those individuals not get treatment they actually only got incarceration heroin addiction is often deadly just as crack cocaine was in leading to overdose or to other chronic diseases the rate at which the occurrence of heroin overdose deaths has increased is cause for alarm in the 4 years between 2010 and 2014 heroin overdoses more than tripled in 2013 11 million people admitted to the improper use of prescription painkillers and therefore were at a heightened risk of becoming addicted that is why we have worked together this week on legislation to put together something like an omnibus in order to reduce the risks of addiction and to fund appropriate treatment responses for those who abuse these drugs the bill that was passed yesterday reflects the strategy by proposing to establish a grant program to be administered by the department of justice to assist states and local governments it is important to note these statistics the rate of deaths from heroin overdoses that account from the white population saw a 267 percent increase between 2010 and 2014 in african americans there was an increase of 213 percent in 2010 to 2014 in hispanics there was a 137 percent increase from 2010 to 2014 and in native americans there was a 236 percent increase no aspect of american life has been uninfluenced by the devastation of heroin overdoses and deathsmany of it impacting families whose young bright talented athletic and otherwise young people have fallen victim to this this grant program is extremely helpful for which i am very pleased because it deals with monitoring the prescription drugs and it deals with matching those who are committed to working with police officers it is truly an important bill let me close by saying that we must have money to support all of this and i am hoping that this will not be the last stop we will make i rise in support of this amendment to s 524 the comprehensive addiction and recovery act this week the house adopted a number of bills thattogetherare intended to provide a response to the

5046 reflects this strategy by proposing to establish a grant program to be administered by the department of justice to assist states and local governments particularly by helping criminal justice agencies to tackle the opioid problem from a variety of angles this bill included in this amendment encourages the development of alternatives to incarceration that provide treatment as a solution to the underlying motivation for criminal behavior or conduct associated with mental disorders we must make our best efforts to prevent individuals from moving from painkillers to heroin by making treatment for addicts more accessible by encouraging the use of evidencebased programs such as medicationassisted treatment lifesaving overdose reversal drugs like naloxone are most valuable in the hands of trained individuals who regularly come in contact with individuals who are prone to drug overdoses this legislation will increase the use and availability of naloxone and other overdose reversal drugs to first responders addiction is a disease that affects the brain and eventually changes the behavior of addicts causing them to experience mental health issues and encounter legal problems treatment is the most reasonable and effective approach to diverting these individuals away from homelessness and prison there are also specific provisions we have proposed that allow for a wide range of services to be offered to our veterans who tend to suffer from mental health issues and addiction i support this legislation because i believe that it will help save lives and prevent and treat opioid addiction the approach congress is taking with the crisis of heroin and other opioids is thoughtful and comprehensive i hope it signals a departure from some of the failed approaches concerning other drug crises in the past for instance our response to the surge in crack cocaine in the 1980s was to enact draconian mandatory minimum penalties with vastly disparate treatment for crack and powder cocaine at that time we in congress took action that we are still trying to rectify at one point more than 80 of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were african american despite the fact that more than 66 of crack users are white or hispanic as we work on other legislation to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack issue we must reexamine our approach to that and other drug issues while law enforcement has an appropriate role and the bills recognize that the bills we adopted this week and that we put forth as an amendment to the senate bill today reflect a broader strategy that reflects the fact that this is an addiction issue accordingly we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums but we are funding antiaddiction mechanisms such as treatment alternatives to incarceration we are not adding to mass incarcerationwith all of the related and devastating collateral consequencesbut instead we are incentivizing state and local governments to prevent treat and heal that is what we should be doing and that is what we should have done for crack and cocaine addicts with that history in mind and with the chance to take smarter and more effective steps now i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the houseand in the senateto apply this more comprehensive approach including treatment alternatives to those suffering from crack and cocaine addiction yesterday in my closing remarks on h r 5046 i stated my intention to ensure that we make progress on addiction not only involving opioids but drugs like crack and powder cocaine as well as i express my support for this legislation i urge my colleagues to work with me in this broader initiative as well as join me in

the poor of el salvador each were bound together in tragedy on december 2 1980 maryknoll sisters ita ford and maura clarke ursuline sister dorothy kazel and a young woman named jean donovan each traveled different paths to el salvador in the words of sister dorothy they were united by a powerful sense of responsibility to spread the gospel to people who needed help they sought to bring peace and comfort to vulnerable persons caught in a maelstrom of political turmoil on the cusp of a brutal 12year civil war that followed the 1980 murder of newly beatified archbishop oscar romero who was killed by an assassins bullet as he said mass sister dorothy and jean had each joined a mission team from the diocese of cleveland ohio together they worked to ferry food and medical supplies to the sick and wounded in whom they saw the face of christ sister dorothy had been engaged but postponed her marriage to test a call to religious life jean donovan wanted to get closer to christ in the poor though her friends hoped that she would leave el salvador reunited with her fiance briefly to attend a friends wedding in ireland jean actually chose to stay in el salvador a little bit longer she was drawn by the beauty and warmth of the salvadoran people sister ita and sister maura both from new york and born nearly 10 years apart had each sought a life of service through the maryknoll religious sisters their paths led through chile and nicaragua respectively and ultimately to el salvador where they each responded to archbishop romeros call a plea for help it has been said of sister ita that her twinkling eyes and her elfin grin would surface irrepressibly even in the midst of poverty and sorrow sister maura for her part was outstanding in her generosity always saw the good in others and could always make those whose lives she touched feel loved all of these women could have left instead they remained in el salvador to be faithful sister maura said there is a real peace here in spite of many frustrations and the terror around us god is very present in his seeming absence they gave all that they had to the poor and homeless whose difficulties were compounded by the
