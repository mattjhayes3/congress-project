congress to eliminate funding for the fuels conversion office of the department of energys economic regulatory administration and to repeal provisions if not the whole powerplant and industrial fuel use act of 1978 these two items are interrelated as the fuels conversion office implements certain provisions of the fuel use act without adequate funding this office would not be able to fulfill its obligations to the law and without the law this country would take a giant step backward in its efforts to become energy independent the administration proposes to eliminate funding in fiscal year 1982 for the fuels conversion office which has the authority to issue conversion orders to coalcapable electric utility units burning oil under the fuel use act and its predecessor the energy supply and environmental coordination act of 1974 there is currently the possibility of converting 68 units at 32 plants with a combined capacity of over 13 250 mw from oil to coal conversion of all 68 units would displace approximately 350 000 to 450 000 barrels of oil per day and increase coal consumption by approximately 35 to 50 million tons per year with only a small number of exceptions the utilities which own these units have indicated publicly that they are eager to convert furthermore doe has examined the constraints to conversion carefully for each plant and has concluded that conversion is appropriate why one may ask would these utilities need conversion orders if they are eager to convert the answer lies with a provision of the clean air act which allows delayed compliance from new source performance standards for utilities armed with conversion orders but does not allow the same for utilities which voluntarily convert thus if funding is terminated for the fuels conversion office many of these utility units will never be converted since they will not have mandators conversion orders in the same sense if the fuel use act is amended in such a way that section 301 b is repealed these orders will never be issued in view of the modest amount of funding required to continue this program and the strong national interest in reducing oil consumption it would be unfortunate to say the least to eliminate funding for the fuels conversion office i would urge the appropriations committee to provide adequate funding for this program with the stipulation that some funds be used to process conversion orders in addition i would further urge that during congressional consideration of amendments to the fuel use act section 301 b is retained and not repealed finally amendments have already been introduced to the fuel use act which would remove restrictions on the use of natural gas as a utility boiler fuel while there is certainly an argument to be made to remove some of these restrictions in light of new discoveries of gas reserv3s in this nation i have three problems with this effort first i am not yet convinced oilfired boilers which are coalcapable should convert to natural gas instead of coal as this legislation seems to allow second while new reserves are being found much of this gas does not appear to be readily available using present technology third i would offer that if these restrictions on natural gas are lifted then it would seem fair to expedite the decontrol of gas prices by doing so all fuels would compete at their true costs instead of some fuels like natural gas having artificially low prices due to federal wellhead controls"], [7.092952728271484e-06, 0.49999290704727173, 1, "no no no no no that is included in

out that the fed discount rate was 12 percent a year ago yesterday it was lowered to 8v2 percent the annualized growth of monetary aggregates m and mi have averaged over 10 percent since august the effects of a change in monetary policy are felt after a lag of usually 6 to 9 months we are now seeing effects of changes in monetary and fiscal policy over the last year in increased housing starts

constructive about it and lord knows over the years congress has done a poor job on fiscal policy congressional directives to lower interest rates are bound to lead to renewed fears of inflation and

congress on the urgent need to repair our nations deteriorating transportation network just as people cannot function with veins and arteries which do not work properly so our nations economy cannot function properly with vital arteries of commerce that are worn out the condition of our nations infrastructure has reached crisis proportions our interstate highway system is deteriorating at a rate requiring reconstruction of 2 000 miles per year although it has yet to reach completion and secondary roads off the interstates are often in much worse condition more than 100 000 of our nations bridges are officially listed as dangerous and 45 percent of them are either obsolete or structurally deficient in my home state of colorado needed bridge repairs alone will cost 200 million we simply have no alternative but to begin a major effort to rebuild in the long term this is a costeffective effort estimates are that it costs five times more to rebuild a bridge once it has fallen than to repair it before it does yet the past 15 years have been marked by massive underinvestment in public facilities since 1965 the percent of gross national product devoted to our infrastructure needs has dropped from 3 6 percent to 1 7 percent in 1980 we simply must correct this deficiency we cannot expect our economy to achieve sustained growth if our public transportation network is in a shambles

public transportation network and providing jobs to an estimated 300 000 americans while i strongly support this bill for it will take us in a direction we simply must go i am deeply troubled by the primary and interstate 4r funding formulas contained in the bill the formulas contained in h r 6211 represent a dramatic change in funding which is very detrimental to the interest of not only western states but of other states which share our geographic and demographic transportation profile according to the colorado highway commission the formula changes would shift the balance away from the number of lane miles of state highway and toward vehicle miles traveled or its surrogate fuel consumption the primary formula in this bill would change the present careful balance which takes into consideration such things as area rural delivery mileage and intercity mail route mileage to one based simply on rural and urban population this change alone would lead to a decrease of 8 6 inillion annually and my states highway commission estimates that the combined effect of these changes could cost colorado over 21 million in expected revenues for next year additionally the changes in the interstate 4r program comes on top of a change made last year that already has cost the western states millions of dollars the formula change in h r 6211 represents the final step in a shift in the program away from the fair treatment of the western states with their extensive roads and few people and toward the exclusive interests of states with large populations and small geographic areas in short it removes the funding balance which is critical to a national program of this type i certainly hope that the floor managers of this bill in the other body follow through on their stated intention to oppose in conference any changes in the existing funding formula despite this serious reservation i urge my colleagues to support this bill we must rise above regional disputes and
