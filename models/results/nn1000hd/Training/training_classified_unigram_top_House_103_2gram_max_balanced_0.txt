1, "i rise today in strong support of our president and in strong support of house concurrent resolution 64 the budget resolution for fiscal year 1994 president clinton told the american people last fall that if he was entrusted with the responsibilities of executive governance he would bring changechange from the human disregard of the past decade he has already delivered on that promise because like martin luther king he believes that what selfcentered men have tom down other centered men can build up the president and the democrats in congress have presented an economic package that will accomplish what no republican even attempted in 12 years we have before us an investment package that carefully balances the needs and ambitions of our countryfor jobs housing education and economic developmentwith the daunting reality of an out of control budget deficit the budget package accomplishes this delicate balance by fairly placing the greatest burden on those that reaped the greatest returns in the hitandrun 1980s today for the first time in more than a decade the executive and legislative branches of government come together to outline the future of this country that future is paved by a plan that commits 2 out of every 3 saved from spending cuts and revenue increase for deficit reduction while 1 out of every 3 saved is used for new investment as a result the budget achieves substantial deficit reduction while also making sizable now investments to improve longterm growth and address unmet needs i must state for the record that i would have preferred a package that went further in addressing the needs of our devastated communities a package that would have contained more social investment i was particularly concemed when 63 billion in cuts were added to the presidents initial plan these are real cuts in significant areas some of which hurt that is why i believe that the economic stimulus package cannot be trimmed cannot be altered we must hold the line on this cutting frenzy that is also why i supported the alternative budget package offered by the congressional black caucus and the congressional progressive caucus which mirrored the presidents package in many ways but added to it in some areas this alternative plan achieved added investments for social programs through increasing the top corporate tax rate from 36 to 38 percent and talsing the top rate on capital gains income from 28 to 31 percent the alternative budget also eliminated the two regressive provisions of the democratic tax packagethe energy tax and the increase in taxes on higher income social security recipients but unfortunately i realize that we do not have the votes to make these changes to the budget so i believe strongly that the democratic budget is the best plan we can pass through the congress to understand fully the need for social investment and economic parity in this country we need to understand fully the present condition of this country and how we got here we must realize that the disastrous economic decisions of the reagan and bush years have choked us with a long running economic recession which has particularly affected low wage laborers and people of color and damaged the prospects for longterm economic growth in this country the senseless military buildup of the last decade has been rendered useless by the spread of democracy and the end of the cold war money was stripped from housing and other social programs to fuel the missiles and tanks that now sit there and await the arrival of a military enemy while the enemies of poverty hopelessness sickness and inequality devour our human potential as bill clinton and al gore articulated in their campaign literature during the 1980s our government betrayed the values that made america great providing opportunity taking responsibility rewarding work as census data shows there were 35 7 million poor americans in 1991 numbers which had not been seen in this country since before the great society programs of the 1960s it is important to note that this statistic is based on the government standard of poverty which lists the average poverty threshold for a family of four at under 14 000 which comes to approximately 67 per week to house feed and clothe each person in that familyan inconcelvable standard that requires careful review and revision this increase in poverty was particularly sharp among our youngest americans with now over 14 million children officially classified as poor like the overall number of poor people this number of poor children is greater than at any time in the last two decades certainly the recession has contributed harshly to these numbers but it is not the sole culprit even before the recession we saw many working class families less able to put their hands on the ladder of mobility let alone attempt a climb according to the center on budget and policy priorities in washington the principal determinants of these statistics have been declining wages and a weakening of the safety net a 1992 census report illustrated that the proportion of fulltime year round workers who are paid wages too low to lift a family of four out of poverty has grown sharply in recent years in 1979 some 12 1 percent of workers were paid wages this low by 1990 that figure grew to 18 percent the census data also reveals a longterm increase in poverty rates among working families the poverty rate for families with children in which the family head works climbed nearly onefourth between 1980 and 1991 but the declines in income have not been across the board changes to the unitedstates tax code during the early 1980s robbed pedro to pay paul average working families paid 5 8 billion more in taxes between 1977 and 1992 while those families earning incomes over 168 000 received a 83 7 billion windfall this redistribution of income is most staddy portrayed by the statistic that in 1983 the wealthiest 1 percent of the population controlled 31 3 percent of the wealth but by 1989 they controlled 37 1 percent of the wealth to understand the impact of these numbers think of dividing 100 among 100 people one person would get 37 and the other 99 people would each receive 68 cents that is the state of income distribution in this country the poisons of racism and sexism have further aggravated wage disparities while white male weekly incomes average 509 those of black and hispanics average 374 and 328 respectively the unitedstates bureau of labor statistics also informs us that these same weekly wages were 374 for white women 323 for black women and 293 for hispanic women making us the lowest paid of all groups a second factor pushing poverty rates up over the past decade has been declines in government assistance programs especially those for the poor and the unemployed many of these government cuts were directed where we could least afford them our cities general revenue sharing was eliminated urban development action grants were eliminated community development block grants were reduced by over 15 billion assisted housing money was cut by over 68 percent and urban mass transit funding was cut by close to 8 billion these longterm trends have forcefully intensified the polarization of our society into those that have too much and those that have no chance in my home state of new york the 1980s saw a 10percent decline in the incomes of the poorest fifth of families but an astounding 20percent increase in the incomes of the richest fifth of families l believe that this is not what the founding fathers and mothers of our nascent government had in mind when they assembled to form a more perfect union and promote the general welfare of its citizens so it should come as no surprise that our country wanted change there was a desire by the electorate for representation that was more in touch with them the desire to vote for someone who had a genuine understanding of the every day hardships faced by american voters the desire to vote for someone who would fight for their interests and the desire to vote for someone who would make their lives more secure so this country elected a democrat bill clinton to represent them in washington we must now translate the political empowerment illustrated by this election into economic empowerment for all americans we must have the vision to advance those initiatives that will help people contribute to the system in the long run rather than drain from the system the budget initiatives before us some directyothers indirectly will enable our people to produce for themselves the budget resolution assumes the major clinton initiatives that put people first protect our children and assist the most vulnerable in our society the budget provides full funding for head start by 1999 this essential proposal will help 1 4 million eligible disadvantaged children get ready for school stay healthy with immunizations and health checkups and receive nutritious meals by providing full funding of the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children by 1996 the budget proposal will add 1 9 million pregnant women infants and children to this vital program which addresses infant mortality to reduce hunger in america the budget package increases food stamps by 7 billion over the next 5 years the measure also makes a commitment to our youth by providing 2 million jobs in summer youth employment and training for economically disadvantaged youth aged 14 to 21 as well as funding to repair and maintain job corps centers and to begin building new ones the package also includes a substantial expansion in the earned income tax credit assistance for very lowincome people the credit would allow a minimum wage worker to at least bring his or her family up to the poverty line the credit is tied to earnings so it rewards work to shelter our people and develop our neighborhoods the budget package makes a substantial commitment to housing and community development the package mirrors the presidents proposal to increase rental assistance from 40 000 units to 100 000 units by although a comprehensive health care reform proposal will be presented to the congress by the administration in the spring the president and the democrats in congress did not ignore this issue in the budget proposal the resolution includes full funding for ryan white aids programs major increases for childhood immunizations substantial increases in biomedical research for womens health and increases for more health clinics in lowincome urban neighborhoods this is a budget package that invests in our future and our people i urge my colleagues to support this budget and then heed the call of pericles to walt for that 111494 wisest of counselors time for time will prove this package to be right for amenca"], [0.008189436979591846, 0.008189436979591846, 0, "my remarks tonight should be seriously considered by the democratic members of the freshman class in this body when these members ran for election last year did they tell the voters that they were intending to vote for the largest tax increase in unitedstates history i dont think so did they tell the votersthat they would cast their vote to raise taxes dramatically long before ever voting for any spending cuts i dont think so i dont think my colleagues ran as business as usual tax and spend democrats well then let me explain this budget bill the clinton administration is asking freshmen representatives to support its called the omnibus budget reconciliation act the name is purposely confusing so that the american public is deceived into thinking its something harmless or even good i want the american public to know that this now budget bill really is the largest tax increase in american history it will cost american taxpayers at least 332 billion over the next 5 years as a freshman i have a hard time committing american taxpayers to 332 billion as an engineer i always like to quantify figures using basic math lets see how much this tax hike will really mean to the american family my district is one of 435 districts so i took 332 billion and divided it by 435 the result is 760 million per district that means my district in california alone would be obligated to pay 760 million in new taxes over the next 5 years then i took this simple math a step further there are about 570 000 people in my district so i divided 760 million by 570 000 people i was shocked to see that every man woman and child would have to come up with over 1 300 this means that the average family of 5 will be assessed nearly 7 000 in new tax increases let me repeat 7 000 in new tax increases america has never had this huge a tax increase in its entire history but thats not all this tax bill also includes a new btu tax again lets be honest this is a hidden gas tax this btu tax means 8 cents a gallon that might not should like much but it is were told avg 450 yr of new btu taxes per family is not that big a deal to the average american family i guess this is true its only the price of 2 haircuts but this is not all this btu tax is indexed annually for inflation the cost of this new tax will grow higher and higher each year but wait there is more the btu tax isnt just a gas tax on automobiles it also translates into more taxes on electricity water heating oil and almost every other products so by the time all these new taxes are added together i wouldnt be surprised if the total burden to the average family of 5 will exceed 10 000 in new tax increases thats outrageous we must stop this madness the point i raise for my fellow democratic freshmen is that a yes vote on this tax bill will have grave consequences in 1994 good luck going home and telling people that we voted for the biggest tax increase in unitedstates history i just wanted to quantify this bill using simple mathematics so that the american public will be told the truth let me repeat for the average family of five were looking at nearly 10 000 new taxes i say dont raise taxes no nation has ever taxed its way into prosperity cut these hundreds of wasteful government subsides instead"], [0.008231927640736103, 0.008231927640736103, 0, "last year the president and democrats in congress proposed and enacted the largest tax increase in history

and to that cspan audience that at this time of the day is probably at a peak of 1 million to 1 million people i want to make something very clear at the outset that it is not my desire in discussing the clinton years to engage in any payback i was not one of those who was hurt by watergate and the collapse of the nixon administration i was not hurt personally but i was certainly hurt in my heart by that time i had been over to vietnam eight times seven as a journalist the first time as an air force captain ferrying a rescue airplane i was unable to get myself recalled to active duty as vigorously as i tried it is not payback time for me but i am going to put it in some very simple rough terms as i did to mr richardson earlier during the 1minutes i believe that bill clinton is an illegitimate president and i think he is hurting my nine grandchildren and any other grandchildren that god gives me and my sally i think he is ripping the moral fiber of this country to shreds on the national security front i had some initial feeling of confidence because of the appointments of jim woolsey a rhodes scholar who actually went to class at rhodes and got his rhodes masters degree from oxford which clinton never didmore about that in the coming weeks and months because of the appointment of a great justice and former prosecutor louis freeh as head of the fbi and because we did not get some disastrous appointment as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff he appointed john shalikashvilli thought well maybe things might not be too bad on the national security side but now i see people like jane hansen derek shearer strobe talbot sam brown morton halperin coming into the state department and it scares the hell out of me the white house thumbed its nose at all us in the senate and the house by putting halperin in the national security council where he does not have to bd confirmed i think the best way to prologue my remarks today is to ask for another resignation yesterday i said that roger altman should either retire resign or be fired that jane hansen who is over at treasury with him should either retire or be fired too patsy thomason over at the white houseshe doesnt have a security clearance anyway nor does dee dee myers after 1 year and almost 3 monthsshould retire resign or be fired with st patricks day yesterday i felt a little queasy about calling for the resignation or firing of william kennedy ili the last of the big four vince foster killed himself mrs clinton seems to be in trouble at least speaking from her platform of moral authority one of the rose employees in the government and she is an appointed government official at the highest level without pay and was never elected to anything ever vince foster dead web hubbell resigned in disgrace saying that all of the 60 lawyers at the distinguished rose institute were vindictive and ripping him behind his back on the billing problem it is the day between st patricks and st josephs day so bill kennedy i recommend you resign and get out of there with some dignity although you will spend a lot of time in court bill kennedy has the responsibility for security clearances in the whole white house compound nussbaum had a more direct ear to the clintons even though he was not a former rose firm employee like the other four he knew mrs clinton from the building across the street from this capitol the rayburn building they served together on the watergate house impeachment committee so he trumped kennedy and took security clearances into his nussbaums office and sat on them kennedy was one of those panicking in the middle of the night of vincent fosters death trying to open vincent fosters safe he and thommasson and a couple of the staffers of mrs clinton were the ones that stripped the office of all the madisonwhitewater files at this point heaven knows what else by the way you will see all of these people gone there is no big pressure on my part they will all be gone with the concurrent responsibility of the clinton administration having to fill all these slots go through a confirmation process the front page of yesterdays washington times say it all it shows dave gergen anthony lake thomas mac mclarty and george stephanopoulos looking not 16 not 15 but 13 years of age it says time to clean house young top aids gergen must have liked that seen as liability for the president an anonymous democrat a former democrat party boss said it is hurting the president and it is hurting our party mr clintons top staffers are both mishandling whitewatermadison and damaging the party now having gotten the william kennedy iii matter out of the way let me read in its entirety a column by mona charen nationally syndicated columnist i have gotten to meet mona personally several times i happen to think she is one of the best columnists in the country it is titled when the scandal monster strikes there is a related cartoon showing little kitty cat looks like a tom cat and clinton saying i have got my pride and then some cuss words all of the asterisks and circles arkansas is on his neck he is hitchhiking next to him is socks with a cat head and he is leaving town this is from the dallas morning news the subheadline is from mona it says if a republican had done that the press would be echoing with words like sleaze and abuse of power listen to the sage words of mrs charen when president clinton averred that he had never known anyone with a stronger sense of right and wrong as mrs clinton it allowed senator al damat0 new york republican to get off the stinging rejoinder thats the problem before anything is proved about what happened or did not happen with the clintons whitewater deals one thing is becoming clear these people who came to washington proclaiming the dawn of the new democrat are not just old democrats taxing spending endorsing quotas weak on defense god knows i have spent 18 years here with those old democrat types and they still dominate this institution but these are practitioners par excellence of old politics cash for influence back scratching sweetheart deals and womanizing upon examination mr clinton is beginning to resemble not his hero thomas jefferson whose memory was heavyhandedly invoked during inauguration week i remember senator al gore walking in monticello into one of the main drawing rooms and saying who are these people pointing at washington and ben franklin two most easilydesignated busts ben because of the long shoulderlength hair and the glasses i remember the monticello kickoff well that morning i tried to avoid the rest of the day charen says mr clinton is not resembling jefferson and not george washington but george washington plunkitt the tammany hall pol whose autobiography contained the memorable defense of honest graft that is a book for our former colleague tony coelho i always wondered where the title came from honest graft the plunkitt line was i seen my opportunities and i took em read mona says the march 21 edition of national review rick brookhiser provides a whitewater primer that sketches the outlines of the clintons cozy businessgovernmentfriendship ties to the constant refrain from the white house that there have been no allegations of wrongdoing by the president there can only be one response how many allegations do you want i will repeat that because i have a desk loaded with them how many allegations of wrongdoing including coverup and criminality do you want my colleagues and fellow americans how about david hale he goes to court next week he has accused clinton of leaning on him to approve a 300 000 sba loan to susan mcdougal the sba program was supposed to assist minority and disadvantaged businesses instead it found its way to a wealthy friend of the governor this susan mcdougal has returned to the scene of the crime and is in little rock she is under indictment in my county in californiafor scamming tens of thousands of dollars from one of the nations great philharmonic conduc tors zubin mehta she is my choice for the first one to crack and become whitewaters john dean at her press conference in little rock she issued a short statement and said no questions i am out of here her lawyer i will read his name later maybe next week when asked isnt she going to take the opportunity to clear the clintons as her husband tried to do sort of at least regarding mr clinton yesterday on the brinkley this week show and the lawyer said no comment and split keep your eye on susan mcdougal how many allegations do you want mona says and i echo it there is the allegation that thengovernor clinton asked his friend and business partner james mcdougal to help out the family finances by hiring hillary rodham clinton at 2 000 a month it is not disputed that hrc her royal clinton mrs clinton received 2 000 a month retainer to represent mcdougals savings and loan before the arkansas securities department the commissioner of which one beverly bassettschaffer learned this morning her brother was a huge contributor to governor clinton had been appointed by bill clinton she may be one that cracks beverly bassettschaffer since madison was taking on water in 1985 mrs clinton conceived a plan to save it she petitioned the securities department to permit madison guaranty to sell preferred stock in a letter addressed to dear hillary mrs bassettschaffer what do you know approved the what do you know is monas friends if a republican had done that the press would be screaming words like sleaze conflict of interest greed abuse of power by the way for those of you out there that are as bill clinton would say feeling pain feeling paid well i feel your pain i repeat again i watched the republican white house turn into shambles over a stinking thirdrate attempt as i said last night to steal the play book of the mcgovern campaign it was the most idiotic political thing i have ever seen in my life do democrats learn from that back to mrs charen she says this is why the s l screwup is costing taxpayers so many billions of dollars precisely because of what happened in little rock the congress was forced to vote billions to the resolution trust corporation where altman is within hours of resigning as its acting head james carville of mary matalin fame former campaign manager for the clinton campaign quoted mrs clinton as saying we were never about money well wrong jim all the columns from liberals that are starting to see the light here are saying maybe just maybe clinton himself was not about money but about power and sex but mrs clinton surely was about money one of the reasons i am not focusing much at all on mrs clinton in any of my remarks nor did i on this house floor in september and october of 1992 is because i feel her pain how would you any woman in this country like to live with what pat buchanan called a serial adulterer one of my daughters says serial is too rough a word use pathological use repeated use constant but i see they now call rapists serial rapists and if somebody does something compulsively pathologically over and over and over and over again then they are serial somebody tried to hand me the other day a list of 26 women and i rebuffed it i dont want to see that i have six in my head who have all come public and that is enough for this congressman to make the charge stick what makes it all so hypocritical is that this president goes to grade schools and to junior highs to lecture young people that sex is not a sport after hearing that i turned on jay leno and he was saying if it were a sport bill clinton would be getting a gold medal no not a gold medal back to mona charen she says mrs clinton says we were never about money the carville quote so they say mona writes but check the books even the evidence available now suggests otherwise the clintons spent the 1980s buying and selling and engaging in transactions whose complexity thwarts understanding even today not the stuff of financial naifs but even if their claim to have lost money on the deal turns out to be true and imagine the clintons feeding themselves to rush lmbaugh when mrs clinton and i say offensively surrounded by military people in uniform who were within arms reach of her surrounded by military people while he is surrounding himself again with military people at fort drum she says heaven knows what would you be saying if we made money i am glad we lost money russ limbaugh is grinning eartoear and saying imagine people telling you bragging they are glad they lost money and they want oneseventh of our national economy to devise a socialized medical health plan unbelievable back to charon when republicans lose money they are accused of excessive greed reaching and failing when democrats lose money its evidence of their moral superiority chew on this mona says there is an allegation that as governor bill clinton leaned on david hale then running an arm of the small business administration to help jim and me out the clintons deny this but it is a fact that the sba tasked with helping minority enterpreneurs did make a 300 000 loan to susan mcdougal former wife of james mcdougal and partner one of four with the clintons in whitewater development corp and 150 000 of that sum was invested in whitewater there are the records it was invested in whitewater when within hours the next day this is one of five books i have back in the cloakroom that contain many of the whitewater documents it is so big it reminds me of when president reagan stood up there at the second lectern and dropped that 14pound book of the budget one year well you should see the size of the books back here of some records made available by interested folks doing a lot of digging isnt it amazing how people can get into our bank records these days whatever happened to privacy what my colleague jim leach as a republican and his staffers on the committee on banking are finding out i do not know but god knows what fiske with federal subpoena power hundreds of fbi accountants and agents is going to find out down there at little rock and maybe an s l in illinois remember the old adage you can indict a ham sandwich bill clinton is as big a ham sandwich as youll even see mrs clinton defended the lasater case i may not get to that today but if somebody said to me what word smashes you in the face more than any other word in all the research you have done what screams out to be investigated the word is lasater wasnt that a good movie here recently lassiter yes tom selleck my pal a good solid conservative republican lassiter lassiter get this line i have a habit of red underlining important things it goes way back to school in the air force sometimes i will underline a whole red article and my wife sally said why dont you just dip it in ink i underlined a line last year and passed the article to my wife and she said you underlined something here but you didnt even tell me about this i said what i missed it it did not even sink in here is the line dan lasater paid off roger clintons 8 000 drug debt this is while they were both indicted for cocaine roger had already been in jail he was on his way he was an unindicted cocospirator in a cocaine trial where lasater bills friend went to jail where did we last hear unindicted coconspirator i dont know could it have been watergate here is lasater paying off the current presidents brothers drug debt back then 8 000 the point is my wife says to me to whom did they pay the drug ebt was that to the fbi for their investigative hours wasted was it to the dea the drug enforcement agency was it to court costs no my wife says i think what they could mean here is to the drug dealers anyway it is a good question wait until the members see the airplane deals that i discuss next week at mena airfield in arkansas infamous both for gun running to bad guys good guys and much drug running dan lasater remember that name guess who handled all of lasaters financial affairs while he was in the slammer awaiting his bill clinton pardon for cocaine abuse a big race track buff this is the guy that met virginia kelly clintons mother at the race track got her a box became friends introduced her to the then young governor guess who ran all of lasaters affairs for 2 years while he is in the slammer patsy thomason the person rummaging around the office of vince foster while he is undergoing an autopsy that is why i have called for her firing or resignation back to mona if it is true that vince foster was working on whitewater matters before his death then the clintons and he were in violation of the law that forbids government employees from working on personal matters for their bosses remember the indictment of senator kay bailey hutcmison of texas there is a great bitterness among democrats that the clintons are being subjected to any scrutiny at all they lament for the nation but their cries ring hollow as republican cries rang hollow in 1973 and 1974 they created this monster the scandal machine deploying it first against richard nixon and then against ronald reagan and then george bush and then trying to destroy robert bork and then coming within a hair of destroying clarence thomas and pardon the inadvertent pun ed meese richard allen over a watch as a gift in a safe that he never even saw touched wore touched it when he put it in the safe and forgot about a 300 watch and it destroyed this brilliant man dick allen for serving reagan although he still continues to serve his country in the private sector there was richard allen carol ianonne ray donovan who said where do i go to get my reputation back theodore olsen elliott abrams caspar weinberger and dozens more the democrats created this monster and now the monster has turned on its master this is why it is so galling to see my democrat colleagues take to the well to speak against congressional hearings we all know and i mean know that if any republican president had done anything near what this one has done there would be a congressional hearing before you could say obstruction of justice what hypocrites now a word about the rose law firm each state in our union is allowed to have two big beautiful statues in this wonderful capitol building i think there are now 98 only two states have submitted one statue i think one of them might be hawaii their first statue is the great priest of the lepers father damien who contracted leprosy himself and who is going to be beatified as a saint of the roman catholic church this summer in rome raised to sainthood by pope john paul so that shows you how important this is by the way downstairs in statuary hall there are 9 or 10 ministers and priests and nuns including from my own state of california who chose junipero serra who has already been raised to blessed and will probably be a saint before the decade is out the other one from california is the great reverend thomas king a protestant minister in california who spoke out loudly and righteously against slavery let us go to arkansas they have two the first one down in the hall of statues is james t clarke he died in 1916 as a sitting unitedstates senator he was a former governor of arkansas a great lawyer state attorney distinguishedlooking gentleman james p clarke now the statue that sits out that door in statuary hall between jefferson davis who is one of the two statues submitted by mississippi which honors his service precivil war as an admiral one the left of the statue i am about to mention is robert fulton the great designer of the steam engine into the steamboat in between is a statue that stunned me the other day it simply says and it is a 7foot 6inch statute of a towering thinasarail handsome man looks like hal holbrook in the tom cruise movie the firm and it said only rose arkansas the press has not written about this until this very week often i mentioned it on the floor listen to this and you will understand why those 60 lawyers at the rose firm are insulted and angered by the degradation of the name of their firm by all of the shenanigans by the famous four in the white house first hillary clinton then the nowdeceased vincent foster webb hubbell and william kennedy uriah m rose 1834 to 1913 so he lived to be 79 years of age was a lawyer of international reputation he founded the first law firm west of the mississippi in little rock he was also chancellor of the state charter member of the american bar association and its president in 1901 author of the arkansas constitution and the digest of arkansas reports appointed by theodore roosevelt president in 1907 as one of the delegates to the peace conference of the hague with the rank of unitedstates ambassador governor ambassador president of the bar distinguished lawyer and you wonder why the 60 current lawyers of that firm are furious and when web hubbell called them vindictive down there in little rock the lawyers of his former firm i knew the man was doomed because the billing story was certainly going to grow to be the undoing of web hubbell overbilling clients is poison for a law firm i think it is important that people should not generalize about park police not generalize about the rose law firm and on my side of the aisle not generalize about all democrats not generalize about the congress and understand so try and understand try and be openminded and listen when i say clinton is an illegitimate president now let me make this theme if the troopers in arkansas 10 of them 5 of them the 4 that signed an affidavit and went on tape with the l a times or even only the two that had the guts to see through the media flashback firestorm had gone public in february 1992 during the primary process bill clinton would not now be the president of the united states if jennifer flowers had not frosted her hairand spiked it had not sold the story to a tabloid the star and had a big press conference in new york the press could not have been able to ignore her story if she had released all 109 minutes of her recorded conversations with clinton in the fall of 1991 instead of just releasing 8 minutes clinton would not be president by the way those tapes were authenticated by none other than clinton himself in his call to mario cuomo sitting governor of new york to apologize for saying that cuomo acted like a mafioso on those recordings i have heard both the recordings and as i said yesterday i put the transcript in the record september 23 1992 at the cime i was panicking at the prospect that this flawed person flawed in character was going to be president of the united states if paula corbin now paula corbin jones had come forward with her sexual harassment charges against clinton during the primaries clinton would not be president jones story is far more compelling and detailed than anita hills ever was there are two friends of jones who have signed affidavits backing up jones claim jones says clinton not only propositioned her but exposed himself to her as well you know what the tragedy is it is easy to believe it happened if sally purdue ms arkansas from my time in the 1950s 8 years older than clinton had come forward at a press conference in little rock instead of a dumb talk show like sally jesse raphaels clinton would not now be president if the whitewater thing had been taken seriously when it was first raised clinton would not be president you know many people forgot that this issue was first raised by paul tsongas during the runup to the new hampshire primary recently i was picking up papers around my house and throwing them in the fire stuffing them under the logs all of a sudden i see some red underlining which catches my eye it is an article saying the clintons insist there is no impropriety in the 14yearold real estate transaction i say wait a minute that has to go in my whitewater file here and then i looked at the date march 9 1992 the day before super tuesday i raced to see the reporter kathleen decker the article says clinton and his wife insisted they never made a penny in the deal in arkansas we will know the truth on that when fiske is through with all of this but even if it is true so what it is the intent of their actions that is at issue would we release attempted bank robbers because the vaults were empty i read on what is this referring to the new york times story the day before on march 8 1992 i have that new york times story and others in the l a times and washington post this whitewater issue came up on the radar in march 1992 and the liberaldominant media culture killed it look why did they dump on this because in the debate leading up to super tuesday i believe it was maybe early in new york clinton turns to jerry brown 8year former governor of california when brown brings up the whitewater mess in a very respectful way i might add about my friend jerry and clinton very cleverly turns to him and says youre not worthy to sit on the same stage with my wife bingo the liberal media caves in lets not touch it either or we will be accused of attacking this woman who is going to be a liberal heroine who will do great things she is eventually appointed to the most important government commission of 511 people not one of them even a doctor or a nurse and we do not dare attack her and she pretty much got a free ride the rest of the campaign here is how i am going to structure this over the next few months first its the coverup stupid takeoff on james carvilles line what is whitewater the coverup who is david hale madison s l and the still distinguished rose law firm in spite of some alumni what happened in vince fosters office after this tragic suicide of a tall handsome intelligent catholic father of three beautiful wife what a tragedy a body just like chappaquiddick we have a body and then i am going to put in tom foley quotes our distinguished speaker about the october surprise as well as those al gore quotes on the same subject they are revealing and as i told bill richardson giving my friend from new mexico a headsup i am researching everything the whip david bonior said and everything mr richardson said and what everybody else said about the october surprise when they try to say this is just republican politics trying to tear down a presidencyi will be ready i would sit here some days at the beginning of the day as you may recall one or two of us trying to defend george bush and there would be 40 2 rows of theme team to use mr boniors lines about our group over here theme team 40 people lined up to gut george bush questioning his integrity questioning everything about his presidency ripping him and pulling him down so the little 1minute spots could be picked up or bites out of it on the evening news we all admire cokie roberts she can be tough on all of us not many people know that her husband is steve roberts one of the top political reporters at unitedstates news world report listen to this before my friends on the other side of the aisle try to get in my face i mentioned the title last night who is cheering where is the cheering press he says i repeat i saw the cheering crowds outside young people cheering the institution of the presidency here is a big photograph of a very glumfaced bill clinton and listen to what cokie roberts husband steve roberts writes george bush was recently asked what he missed least about washington george bush recently asked what he missed least about washington dealing with the press he snapped by the way reporters can have a lot of fun with an adjective and a verb they hate to say he said it is so bland so that is where he put in a lot of loaded verbs he snapped i have never seen george bush snap in my life maybe he responded quickly or sadly or mused philosophically but george bush said dealing with the press whenever he said that to me it was with a big sigh i remember he said to me in the oval office in july bob have you ever seen anything like the press now i have never seen anything like this in my whole career in my whole life not at the u n not as head of the party during watergate i have never seen anything like this it is like they take this race personally and they are trying to fire me keep that in mind that was directly to me it says the answer reflects an article of faith among republicans that a leftleaning prodemocratic press corps cost bush the 1992 election by leading cheers for bill clinton well i will tell you something steve let sally and i and you and cokie go out to dinner and i will document for hours why it is an article of faith for this republican that a leftleaning proabortion dismisspotsmoking dismissadultery press was shilling for clinton and covering his youknowwhat it almost made me think they

from 388 million this year to 541 million in fiscal year 1994 and 1 billion in fiscal year 1995 my amendment would prevent this profligacy and save the taxpayers 800 million it was just a few short weeks ago that the democrats in this house passed a 5year budget plan which included the largest tax increase in american history we were told then by the democrat majority that this hefty contribution on the part of hard working taxpayers was necessary to reduce the federal budget deficit and here they propose increasing spending on corporate giveaway programs by 158 percent and what does h r 820 do under this bill the federal government is going to build an enormous network of technology centers so bureaucrats can show business men and women what machines to buy and how to run their businesses and the same people who gripe about socalled junk bonds are putting uncle sam in the venture capital business if you thought the s l crisis was bad wait until bureaucrats start making multimilliondollar commercial loans and finally the government is going to spend hundreds of millions each year picking winners and losers in the name of promoting technology here is what we are saying to the taxpayers today the government that brought you amtrak the post office the usda and 500 toilet seats at the pentagon is going to teach real entrepreneurs how to beat international competition the reason this bill is on the floor of course is that the majority believes that committees here in congress and the bureaucrats at the commerce department know how to run the economy as george will noted in a column 2 weeks ago the liberals in washington dc believe they know far more about competing in the marketplace than the undiscerning men and women who have risked their life savings to start a real business in the real world well let us take a look at what the democrat majority has already done for business this year it has heaped another mandate on workers and business in the form of mandated leave legislation it has passed a budget resolution which promises business higher energy and corporate income taxes the majority has promised the business community and the country another 5 years of huge budget deficits which will deprive the private sector access to capital but we have only just begun on the way is striker replacement and the rest of the big labor and trial lawyer agenda which will undermine americas competitiveness the finest illustration of the economic illiteracy of the majority is this the democrat party opposes indexing the capital gains taxwhich lowers the cost of capitalyet supports indexing the minimum wagewhich increases the cost of labor but the democrats are here to help business today they say the party that beleaguers business with higher taxes and regulations at every opportunity now wants to help the majority wants to promote economic growth and jobs through investment sounding ironically like supplyside onservativq republicans but as my friend jude wanniski says the majority is operating on the dark side of the supplyside modelinvesting in government bureaucracies instead of the private sector so as russia sweden mexico france poland and on and onmove away from state planning to emulate the american model of free enterprise the majoritywhile paying lipservice to the market seeks to move more and more resources from the productive private sector to the wasteful public sector if my democrat friends are genuinely interested in creating real jobs in the private sector they should consider this over the last 4 years the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent these small businesses create 76 percent of the new jobs in the economy if you want to help the entrepreneur lower his cost of capital stop tying his hands with unnecessary red and green tape do not raise his energy costs and corporate taxes reform americas legal liability laws amend antiquated antitrust law in short get the government off the backs of small business but do not burden all businesses with massive new taxes and regulations and then give away a billion dollars to the politically wellconnected that will not make america more competitive i would close with a quote from adam smith who warned us of politicians who were onceited enough to try to direct an economy he wrote the statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would net only load himaelf a most unnecessary atten tion but same an authority which could safely be trusted to no council and senate whatever and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it support
