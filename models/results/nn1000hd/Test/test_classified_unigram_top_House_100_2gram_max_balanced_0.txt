in the administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding

in support of the conference report on h r 2470 the medicare catastrophic protection act which expands current medicare benefits to protect the elderly against devastating catastrophic health expenses the bill makes important modifications to medicare to limit an individuals outofpocket medical expenses including the cost of extended hospital stays doctor bills and prescription drugs and contains provisions to prevent one spouse from becoming completely impoverished before medicaid will pay the cost of nursing home care for the other it also contains a new medicaid waivsr authority that will help states care for medically fragile infants and young children in nonhospital settings i am especially pleased that the bill creates a new benefit under medicarerespite care to provide temporary relief for a relative or friend caring for an elderly family member who cannot be left alone the select committee on children youth and families recently held a hearing on the sandwich generation that highlighted the concerns of family members who provide continuous care for their elderly dependent parents and their own children at the same time the families who testified expressed an overwhelming commitment and desire to provide a loving home they noted however that limited family support services such as respite care made that task very difficult evidence released at the hearing confirmed that the most pervasive and severe effects of assuming demanding caregiving roles are emotional strain and family stress respite care is essential for these caregivers who often juggle careers child care hou3ework transportation and financial worries according to a study releases at the hearing respite care allows families to maintain their dependent parent at home and avoid institutionalization for a longer period of time families used respite only when they were desperate for help and not as a substitute for family caregiving in addition respite care was the family support service requested more often than any other members of the select committee have heard this request repeatedly from parents foster family carogivers and many who work with families the now waiver is designed to reduce the growing costs of maintaining these medically fragile infants and young children in hospitals and provide them with care in more appropriate and loss costly homelike settings infants and children up to age 5 who have been infected with hiv or who show signs of aids or who were drugexposed and affected at birth and who are or will be receiving foster care assistance under title ive of the social security act would be eligible for the expanded sot of services under the waiver the waiver will give states the authority to include under medical assistance the following set of nonhospital based servcies nursing care respite care physicians services proscribed drugs and medical devices and supplies provided as part of a plan of care for a medically fragile child who without such services would probably remain in a hospital for stays that result in higher total medicaid costs in san francisco alone the savings would be more than 4 000 per child per month the new authority would also waive the medicaid comparability rules and statewideness provisions that can deter states from seeking a waiver and thus allow states to target these needed services better new research conducted by the office of technology assessment also found that for every low birthweight birth averted by earlier prenatal care the unitedstates health care system saves between 14 000 and 30 000 in newborn hospitalization rehospitalizations in the first year and longterm health care costs ota concluded that expanding medicaid to pay for prenatal care for all poor pregnant women is a good investment for the nation i want to call special attention to a significant provision in the bill that protect medically fragile infants in a manner that is both more humane and costeffective the new medicaid waiver authority included in this bill will assist states in moving medically fraglie infants out of longterm hospital care by improving medical and other services available to these children in nonhospital settings in hearings of the select committee over the last few years we have learned about serious and growing problems in providing outofhospital care to growing numbers of medically fragile infants and young children last year when the select committee held a hearing on aids and young children there were approximately 400 reported cases of aids among children under age 5 by mid may 1988 more than 800 cases had been reported among children in this age group even more disturbing are increasing reports of babies being born who have been drug exjune z 1 988 ii13877 posed and may be at risk of hiv infection in new york city one study reported that 1 in 61 babies born last december carried hiv antibodies additionally new york citys infant mortality rate climbed in 1987 after a decade of decline due to substance abuse and aids in san francisco 12 percent of all the births at the county hospital are babies with substance abuserelated problems just a few weeks ago the committee learned that requests for foster care for drugrelated reasons in los angeles county rose several hundred percent between 1981 and 1987 many of these childrensometimes called boarder bables are in state care because their parents are unable or unwilling to care for them these children often have long hospital stays not because they require inhospital care but because of the tremendous difficulty in obtaining and paying for the services needed to care for them outside the hospital yet nonhospitalbased care for these children is not only better for them but has increasingly shown to be cost effective the san francisco fragile infant program which provides a specialized foster care setting with attendant health services for medically fragile infants costs from under 2 000 per infant per month in contrast to 6 375 paid by meditaid to care for an infant in a hospital californias health care system often touted as a model for the nation should serve as a warning instead a report recently released by the southern california child health network warned that the health of californias mothers and babies had begun to deteriorate because parental care services were becoming less available in 1985 californias infant mortality rate increased for the first time since 1965 at a time when policy decisions are driven by budgetary considerations it is especially compelling that the southern california child health network found that an investment of 43 2 million in health care services to the 36 000 pregnant women who go without care each year in california would actually result in savings of 73 4 millionfor a net savings of 30 3 million through avoided hospitalization of newborns the evidence continues to mount that the principal cause of infant mortalitylow birthweightcan be reduced at significant cost savings with earlier and more comprehensive prenatal care the select committee in its report opportunities for success costeffective programs for children 1988 update found that a 1 investment in prenatal care for high risk women can save 3 38 in the cost of care for low birthweight infants while more must be done to address the very real and growing concerns about longterm care and who will pay for it respite care is a key step in any solution to this problem i am especially pleased that this conference report is intergenerational in scope and reasonable in its expansion of medicaid coverage to the most vulnerable groups young and old who live below the poverty line the bill requires states to provide medicaid coverage to pay for medicare premiums deductibles and coinsurance for all medicare beneficiaries with incomes below the federal poverty line equally critically it requires states to provide prenatal care to pregnant women and health care to infants who live in families earning up to 100 percent of the federal poverty line almost half the states still have not opted to cover this vulnerable population leaving millions of women and children remain at risk since 1978 this nation has made virtually no progress in bringing more women into care in during the first 3 months of pregancy fewer than 1 in 4 pregnpnt women receive care in the critical first trimester and this limited access has tragic consequences in 1985 the national neonatal mortality rate failed to decline for the first time since 1960 our colleagues chairman rostenkowski of the committee on ways and means chairman stark of the subcommittee on health and chairman waxman of the subcommittee on health and the environment deserve our collective thanks for their leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor by passing this legislation today we will have taken an important step to assure security for the nations elderly and critical costeffective protection for some of the nations most vulnerable infants and children these are important first steps it is my hope that congress will also ensure than longterm and

congress volume i sets forth a strategy for this congress to consider as it acts upon legislative initiatives that will have a major impact on the lives of our children and their families volume ii in turn provides a wealth of information on a host of federally assisted programs which seek to provide necessary services for our children included are descriptions of programs which address the need for quality education opportunities for selfsufficiency the right to a safe and livable environment and services that will ensure healthy minds and bodies i shall focus my comments and observations on our network of child nutrition programsprograms which in my judgment play a key role in ensuring that our nations children first do have healthy minds and bodies and second are better able to obtain a quality education what is the current status of our child nutrition programs as the vice chairman of the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education which has jurisdiction over our child nutrition programs i believe that we have in place a strong national network of quality programs in which we can all take pride the past present and future success of our child nutrition programs is dependent on a strong federal state and local public and private sector partnership willing to invest the necessary resources to meet the nutritional needs of our nations youngsters when they are in awayfromhome settings at the heart of this network is the oldest and largest of our child nutrition programsthe national school lunch program today the national school lunch program provides nutritionally balanced meals to approximately 24 million school age children or 92 percent of all schoolchildren federal support is provided to participating school districts in a mix of cash and commodity support what level of support the federal government provides is in an inverse relationship to the economic status of the childs family the highest levels of federal support go to meeting the costs of providing meals to our neediest youngsters this is as it should be two important companion programs deserve mention the first is our school breakfast program which is designed to ensure that all youngsters begin their school day with the nutrients necessary to benefit fully from the days educational experience thanks to congressional action during the last congress i am pleased to note that modest increases in both cash and commodity assitance will now be available to improve the overall quality of the breakfast program meal patterns while our school lunch and breakfast programs play a vital part in meeting nutritional needs during the regular school year the summer feeding program complements that initiative by providing nutritious meals to our neediest youngsters during the summer months one of our fastest growing child nutrition activities is the child care food program which essentially provides meal services appropriate to youngsters enrolled in day care centers or family day care homes as more two wageearner families and growing numbers of single heads of households join our labor force the child care food progam will assume an everincreasing role in meeting the nutritional wellbeing of our younger children no overview of the status of our child nutrition programs would be complete without the mention of the special supplemental food program for women infants and childrenmore popularly referred to as the wic program wic is an early health intervention program that seeks to provide individually tailored food packages to lowincome pregnant women new mothers infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk medical services and nutrition education round out the wic program benefits wic program benefits cost an average of 30 per month in return studies clearly demonstrate that wic does make a difference in increasing the birth weights of infants of lowincome women who are at nutritional risk and the probability that these infantswill survive and enjoy a normal and healthy childhood what is the challenge facing the 100th congress in the area of child nutrition first we must see to it that the legislative changes enacted during the 99th congress are fully and quickly implemented second we must continue to take a long and hard look at all phases of child nutrition program policies and operations we cannot rest on our laurels so to speak rather we must strive to maximally utilize what will be of necessity limited resources to the end that we meet our commitment to providing for the nutritional wellbeing and improved educational opportunities afforded to all of our children what is at stake has been eloquently stated in the current offering of letters for women infants and children in the usa being conducted by bread for the world children are our future au of them while adequate diets wilu not compensate for the great differences in access to opportunity between those who have and those who do not it is a start food can enable some children to survive and many others to make better use of educational and economic opportunities food is

democratic resistance and economic incentives to the sandinista government to negotiate a peaceful settlement with them this measure also authorizes funds for the contadora peace process and urges the president to resume bilateral talks with the nicaraguan government and to persuade other central american nations to join with the united states in using economic sanctions to pressure the nicaraguan government into changing its policies the single greatest issue in determining this nations policy toward the situation in nicaragua is whether or not we are willing to accept the establishment of another marxistleninist beachheadlike cubain the western hemisphere to fail to recognize the threat the sandinista government poses to the security of central america and the united states is to bury our heads in the sand the head of our own intelligence agency bill casey tells us that since 1979 when the sandinistas seized control over the government they have developed the best equipped military in the region he estimates the sandinistas have 6 000 to 7 500 cuban advisers and another several hundred other communists from the soviet union and eastern european soviet bloc countries to assist in their military buildup and consolidation of power if we allow the soviets and cubans to develop this powerful beachhead in central america and that ferment spreads our nation will know a security threat that we cannot abide clearly there is only one choice consistent with our national security and foreign policy objectives we must apply pressure from all possible sources to make the sandinistas call a ceasefire and come to the negotiating table with the democratic resistance known as the contras this will be especially difficult at a time when nicaraguas conversion to a marxistleninists state is 80percent complete they are already suppressing the press and expelling those not on their side they are arresting and imprisoning political opponents they are exporting communism to other countries they are tightening down more on the private sector and the evidence goes on down the line that the sandinistas are crs426 intent on following everything cuba has done it is also an unfortunate political reality that marxist governments do not revert to democratic forms of government not one of the some 21 countries that have gone communist have been reversed in nicaragua however there is somewhat of a unique situation a grassroots resistance movement is fighting for a democratic form of government and the same kinds of freedoms this country enjoys but the leaders of the democratic resistance emphasize shortages of food medicine and clothing which severely impede their ability to successfully wage their fight by passing the michel amendment we can encourage and help the democratic resistance continue and bestow legitimacy on their efforts thus we would send a clear message to the sandinistas and to neighboring countries whose borders have been violated that we intend to protect the freedoms and the democratic form of government in this hemisphere if we are going to provide aidhumanitarian or otherto the contras we had better do it now and in a fashion that doesnt slowly bleed them to death and diminish the strongest incentive for the sandinistas to negotiate there are those critics who charge any support for the democratic resistance will result in the united states entering the war in nicaragua with our own military forces the president himself has clearly told us his administration does not seek the military overthrow of the sandinista government or to replace it with supporters of the old somoza regime we certainly dont want another vietnam on our hands we certainly must never again get into a situation that we dont intend to win but whether or not this country would ever have to make the tough decision of military intervention is not the issue at this time lets first utilize all the peaceful means that are available through the michel amendment to try to accomplish our objective of preventing another marxistleninist beachhead we better not keep sticking our heads in the sand and say the situation in nicaragua will go away by itself because that simply will not happen its a lot easier to pay for peace now by helping those grassroots resistance forces who want freedom for themselves and are willing

the establishment of a national bone marrow donor registry under the direction of the secretary of health and human services bone marrow transplantation is an increasingly successful medical procedure that annually saves the lives of thousands of children and adults suffering from a number of blood disorders and cancer the most commmon bone marrow transplants are of the matchedsibling type where marrow is donated by one family member to another it is estimated however that as many as 70 percent of the potential bone marrow transplant patients do not have a sibling donor bone marrow transplants using unrelated donors require a complex array of blood and tissue typings to find an acceptable match this is virtually impossible without a computerized network of potential bone marrow donors in fact of the 1 200 to 1 500 bone marrow transplants performed each year all but a few are of the matched sibling type where bone marrow is donated by a family member locating a nonsibling donor is a difficult and time consuming procedure requiring hundreds of calls by doctors and hospitals usually in a futile effort to locate a suitable match unfortunately matched donors are successfully found in only about 10 percent of these cases the other patients often die without a bone marrow transplant or must undergo a painful procedure where their own bone marrow is withdrawn treated with toxic doses of radiation and chemicals and reintroduced into the patient i became familiar with this unusual medical procedure when a very brave 10yearold girl named brandy bly from pinellas county fl required a bone marrow transplant but had no sibling donor the hospital where she was treated after a lengthy search was also unable to find an unrelated donor the only recource left for her doctors to pursue was a transplantation of her own bone marrow brandy survived the procedure which many patients do not and put up a valiant struggle for her life her struggle lasted 3 months when she died of complications associated with her surgery the bone marrow transplant succeeded but she died of complicatons associated with the powerful drugs used in conjunction with the procedure brandys family and doctors tell me that her chances for survival would have been significantly better and she could be alive today if they had been able to identify a compatible unrelated bone marrow donor in a timely manner according to medical experts ive discussed this matter with the quicker a donor is identified and the transplantation is completed the better the chance is for a patients recovery brandys experiences and those of her family made me aware of the need for a national bone marrow donor registry that could in the future save the lives of many children and adults like brandy whose chances for survival are bleak without it although it is not widely know a national registry is now being established under the jurisdiction of the department of defense to fill this void in our nations health care system it was at the direction of the appropriations committee i serve on that the navy medical research institute in 1986 contracted with the american red cross the american association of blood banks and the council of community blood centers to work with more than 50 blood banks and blood centers to establish a computerized base that one day will instantly have access to more than 100 000 potential unrelated bone marrow donors in the first year of this project more than 17 000 donors have registered to be part of this network and this month the first search of the data bank for donors were undertaken the defense appropriations committee last week approved my request to provide 2 1 million to fund the second year of a 3year contract to maintain the registry and it is in this second year of the contract that doctors expect to see the first successful matches and transplants from this system in response to my questions during our committees hearings earlier this year vice adm lewis seaton surgeon general of the navy said the registry is a very valuable national health program that should be continued but that its responsibility should be transferred to a more appropriate federal agency the most logical agency is the department of health and human services where a registry could be incorporated into a number of areas of research conducted at the national institutes of health it was during a hearing of the energy and commerce subcommittee of health chaired by my colleague from california mr waxman that i urged the department of health and human services to undertake a project to establish and maintain a national registry h r 3097 the legislation before us today would shift the responsibility for the registry from the navy to the department of health and human services to be managed by the department deemed most appropriate by the secretary the transfer would not disrupt the ongoing work of the registry and would allow it to be used for the treatment of patients and to facilitate research at the request of the energy and commerce committee and in response to my testimony earlier this year the office of technology assessment earlier this month completed a report which strongly supports the work of the registry and indicates that greater successes in unrelated bone marrow transplants can be expected with improvements in the matching of donors and recipients with reductions in the waiting period for transplants and with other improvements in the procedure using research based on the registry as a member of the health appropriations committee i want to commend the chairman of the committee for his efforts to ensure that the smooth transition of this program takes place and i want to pledge my commitment to see that the appropriate funding ismade available next year to continue the registrys work a national bone marrow registry with a permanent home in the department of health and human services will give hope to thousands of people by providing a fast and readily accessible means to locate an unrelated bone marrow donor ultimately the national registry will have on file at any one

contribute to the future financial solvency of both funds in addition i am particularly pleased that this legislation includes a provision which i developed after hearing from several railroad retirees in northeast kansas these retirees left railroad service and received severance payments upon which they paid railroad retirement taxes but they did not receive any retirement credit for those tax payments because they were no longer employed by the railroads this problem arose as a result of the solvency act of 1983 which annualized the tax base used for railroad retirement purposes the act also allowed deeming of months of service for benefit purposes to conform to the annualized wage bases however months of service could not be deemed for benefit purposes for any months in which the individual was neither in an employment relation to an employer nor an employee representative as a result individuals receiving severance payments could be subject to significant retirement tas liabilities while receiving credit for only 1 month of service because of the recent change in the law and the large number of recent severance payments in the railroad industry many employees accepting severance have been forced to make as much as a full years contribution to the retirement fund while receiving as little as 1 months credit for service section 301 of this legislation would
