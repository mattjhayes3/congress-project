all be summed up in just nine words tax tax tax spend spend spend borrow borrow borrow this bill is an insult to the american taxpayer it is an insult because the bill increases spending when the federal government is already 400 billion in the red 1 out of the 3 spent by this congress is borrowed money this bill is an insult because under this bill the 4 1 trillion federal debt will get worse much worse the federal debt is so bad that 1 out of every 5 that the american taxpayer sends to washington goes for nothing but interest payments on a national debt and now the democrats in this congress are going to increase the national debt under this bill things will only get worse it is an insult to the american people because the democrats in this house are raiding the social security reserves and other trust funds to the tune of 100 billion a year let me repeat that the trust funds in our country are being raided to the tune of 100 billion a year to cover the big spending that the democrats are pushing through this congress and under this bill social security will be raided even more yes social security is being taxed under this bill and the worst insult of all is that the democrats in this house want working families middleclass taxpayers and remember that tax cut they were promised americas senior citizens are going to pay even more taxes the american people should understand that under this bill the democrats will increase taxes on your social security benefits the democrats will tax social security and will tax social security benefits because the democrats in this house cannot control their big spending habits we republicans are opposed to taxing social security on february 10 the house republican study committee and the house republican research committee jointly held a congressional forum on the social security tax we revealed the damage that this bill will do to millions of senior citizens we detailed the unfairness of taxing benefits that average people earn through their lifetime of work just because the democrats in this house cannot say no to the special interest groups it is not only that they are spending money that upsets me it is that it is a payoff to the special interest groups yesterday i inserted in the congressional record the statebystate impact that this tax will have on senior citizens the democrats budget bill is an insult

caucus begins its 23d annual legislative weekend i join my colleagues in rising to honor the outstanding contributions and dedicated service of former supreme court justice thurgood marshall this years legislative weekend theme is generations celebrating the legacy of africanamerican leadership and so today it is certainly with respect and pride that we are celebrating the legacy of this nations greatest supreme court justice justice thurgood marshall justice marshall will be remembered forever as americas leading crusader in the fight for equality and justice he vigorously served as a true pillar of the civil rights movement as the chief architect of the legal strategy which questioned and subsequently put an end to officially sanctioned segregation in the united states justice marshalls legacy is destined to influence the lives of many for years to come a celebration of the legacy of africanamerican leadership would not be complete without the observance and acknowledgement of the profound contributions and achievements of this truly distinguished leader hindered by numerous obstacles countless confrontations and seemingly insurmountable challenges justice marshall always seemed to rise to the occasion he was forced to valiantly display his cunning ability to persevere in spite of all odds and forces working against him early on in life after completing high school justice marshall went on to attend lincoln university in pennsylvania in 1925 and upon graduation applied to the state law school in baltimore however because of the segregated time in which he grew up thurgood marshall was not admitted because of the color of his skin as a result he registered at howard university law school whereupon he graduated at the top of his class in 1933 and began a solo law practice in baltimore during the depths of the depression with an undying passion in his heart for justice and equality for all justice marshall was selected as general counsel to the naacp legal defense fund in 1936 where for 25 years he traveled throughout the nation representing the interests of black citizens who were systematically denied their constitutional rights provided in the constitution itself thurgood marshall made it his life ambition to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination he fought hard to protect individual and minority rights one of marshalls most important victories occurred in 1954 when he successfully argued before the supreme court the school desegregation case brown v board of education the court ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal justice marshall also valiantly represented the black students vho sought to gain entry to central high school in little rock ar he also fought to protect the civil rights of many of the students who staged lunch counter sitins and integrated the southern bus lines in freedom rides justice marshalls fervent dedication to and belief in the constitution of the united states gained the attention of more than just a few then president john f kennedy appointed him to the unitedstates second circuit court of appeals in new york in 1961 four years later former president lyndon b johnson nominated him for the position of unitedstates solicitor general and on june 13 1967 thurgood marshall was catapulted to greater prominence by being nominated by president johnson to be the first black to serve on the supreme court through thurgood marshalls professional career he sought to enhance and secure equality in the personal lives of all americans his legacy is one for all to recognize and acknowledge marshall so aptly used our constitutional september 15 1993 c traditions to revive our democratic traditions it is today that we take great pride in rising to celebrate the contributions of the late supreme court justice thurgood marshall i would also like to acknowledge and welcome justice marshalls widow cecelia marshall as well as other members of the

words of every republican spoken today and to associate myself with the remarks of a fighting commonsense democrat the gentleman from ohio with all the white house has been doing over the last couple of weeks the american people are justified in asking what in blazes is going on with the clinton administration and specifically what is up with his budget while the concern is real the focus may be a little off indeed many things are going up with the clinton budget we are considering today but the worst things about it are what things are going down i want to bring my colleagues attention to both the ups and the downs of the socalled plan needless to say spending is up despite omb director leon panettas comments earlier this year that the administrations budget would contain 2 in spending for every 1 in new taxes this reconciliation bill reverses this plan it actually contains 6 in taxes and fees for every 1 in spending reductions and it is a 20toi ratio over the first 2 years call me a cynic but that is more in line with what some of us expected indeed whether spending reductions will ever occur is open to question but one thing is clear the president and the majority democrats in congress are interested only in paying lip service to spending cuts in its exhaustive search for domestic programs that dont work and are no longer needed the administration came up with only 11 programs totaling less than 3 billion out of the 1 427 trillion in nondefense outlays in 1997 and of the 343 billion this bill contains in reconciled reductions less than 70 billion is not arrived at by higher taxes overall this budget adds nearly 38 billion in new or expanded entitlement programs which have after all been the problem with this budget all along while the administration has been forced into negotiating with congress over entitlement caps little has been said about the entitlement programs the budget creates even though halt a dozen human resources provisions were cut by 1 2 billion over 5 years incredibly 20 other programs were expanded by 1 9 billion creating a spending increase of 700 million so what did the ways and means committee do characteristically it added new taxes including extending the federal unemployment tax which now enjoys permanent status as a temporary tax only in washington the new immunization program is a good example of how the democrats pass up opportunities to reform social services and simply resort to throwing dollars at problems despite evidence that govemmentprovided immunizations will have no impact on the immunization rate the democrats passed on a republican plan to allow states to use rewards and punishments to encourage welfare recipients to immunize their children thereby adding another 2 billion to cost of this bill there is not even a pretense that the regressive energy tax portion of this tax bill will not be used for more spending the white house has stated that the energy tax will help reduce the deficit and put the government on a payasyougo basis for needed public programs thats more spending folks and itis interesting to see how the democrats have tried to hide the taxs regressivity by robbing one class of taxpayers to pay off another this budget spends at least onehalf of the 71 5 billion expected to be raised over 5 years on lowincome families and individuals including printed on recycled paper containing 100 post consumer waste h 2998 c a 28 billion increase in the earned income tax credit eitc 7 billion in additional food stamp payments and 1 billion for lowincome home energy assistance program payments this forces middleincome familieshardly our nations richest taxpayersto pay an excessive share of the administrations revenue goal and as the energy tax increases yearly it is impossible for the middle class to know the size of the bag it is left holding it truly is a stealth tax which brings me to the next item that is up with the clinton budgettaxes all of this increased spending will require passage of the most massive tax hike in history it calls for 332 billion in tax increases over next 5 years and adding the various hidden increases the tax bite will grow even larger in later years it creates a new individual income tax rate brackets at the 36 and 39 6 percent levels which reach even lower down the income scale than now these new tax rates are supposed to raise 31 billion of the 39 billion in deficit reduction for 1994 under this plan gone at least from this reconciliation bill is all pretense of a millionaire surtax the white house no longer pretends that it is anything more than another rate bracket with millionaires defined now as those earning more than 250 000 and of course this tax is retroactive to the beginning of 1993 even families with incomes under 20 000 contrary to the presidents claims will bear the burden every time they pay their heating bills fill their gas tanks of make a purchase of almost any kind the clinton energy tax alone will cost every american family 471 a year individuals with adjusted gross incomes over 150 000 who pay estimated taxes must under the clinton budget pay 110 percent of current year taxes as next years estimated taxes to qualify for a safe harbor so individuals with no increase in income or tax liability during that year are effectually giving the government an interestfree loan this is outrageous but it is even worse for corporations even though this bill sets the maximum corporate tax rate at 35 percent large corporations which pay estimated taxes must pay a full 100 percent estimation rather than the 97 percent under current law this reduces the margin of error in computing estimated taxes and virtually assures the assessment of penalties the administration hopes to gain 2 7 billion from this unfair illusory deficit reduction provision which will only speed up the payment of corporate taxes by a few months and make a cheap profit from hardtofollow rules which are broken there is a hidden rate bracket increase in this reconciliation bill on small businesses and family farms the biggest job creators throughout the 1980s the bill would phaseout the permanent personal exemption limiting itemized deductions and removing the cap on wages subject to the health insurance tax there is also a new maximum marginal tax rate of nearly 44 percent as my colleagues know the maximum marginal tax rate currently almost 32 percentrepresents the true incentive for entrepreneurs to earn extra money so once a person pays the highest stated tax rate of 39 6 percent adds in a medicare tax for selfemployed individuals of 2 9 percent and tacks on an itemized deduction limit at about 1 2 percent tell me what is the incentive for him or her to engage in the type of

take this occasion to talk about the potential for bipartisan effort because i had so many different members of the house tell me that whatever side they were on last night on the nafta vote they thought it was really healthy it was a bipartisan debate and a bipartisan vote that there were democrats and republicans on both sides and they thought it was healthy for the country to have that kind of bipartisan effort in talking with a number of reporters today i was asked again and again does the fact that 138 republicans voted with 102 democrats to pass something in a genuinely bipartisan effort mean that there is a possibility for bipartisanship what struck me was that there are a lot of opportunities for bipartisanship my colleagues just heard a special order done by mr kasich of ohio a republican and mr penny of minnesota a democrat about the pennykasich proposal to cut spending which is a bipartisai effort put together by democrats and republicans working in a room trying to develop some real solutions and trying to do something which will help all americans i think it is possible to develop a series of bipartisan efforts in health care for example i know that there is a coopergrandy bill mr cooper of tennessee a democrat and mr grandy of iowa a republican have worked on a managed competition approach to health care and i am told that tomorrow there will be a rowlandbilirakis bill mr roland a democrat of georgia and mr bilmals a republican from florida who have been working on a commonsense bill that would bring together good ideas in a positive way so there are opportunities for bipartisanship and for putting together in a bipartisan way real reforms the question i have been asked of course all day is are there opportunities for the house republican leadership and for the house republicans to work with president clinton and with the clinton administration on good positive bipartisan efforts and it seems to me that there are in fact many opportunities for us to work together i would suggest that what we need to do in looking at next year as the president prepares his budget proposals and as he looks forward to the state of the union as he considers legislative opportunities is we need to recognize that we could work together to set an agenda for americans that would be very very powerful in a bipartisan way we could agree i think for example that if nafta the north american freetrade agreement goes through as apparently it will in the senate on saturday that we need a bill what i would call an economic growth after nafta a bill designed to create jobs to make american industry more competitive to give american workers more job security to create a better opportunity for american to compete both in the north american freetrade areas and in the world and i believe as people watch the president in seattle dealing with the asian nations and looking at trade in the pacific they will understand why we need an economic growth bill a job creation bill designed really to follow secretary bentsens advice to the japanese the secretary of the treasury said recently that the japanese need to cut spending and cut taxes and cut regulation and stimulate their economy and i think that is advice frankly that we should take here at home i believe it ought to be possible to develop a real welfare reform bill to require work as a condition of getting money from the government and i think that the work which has been done by congressman santorum and congressman shaw and congresswoman johnson and congressman gary franks of connecticut have put together a welfare reform bill which i think if the president could look at he would find would be in fact a very very useful beginning for a bipartisan effort to pass serious welfare reform to take a first step toward saving the inner city i think also that in the area of health i honestly believe that we in the house republican leadership and on the task force led by congressman bob mxchel our leader where we have worked for over 2 years to develop affordable health care now a bill which uses personal responsibility and market forces to improve the health of americans a bill which has medical savings accounts it has group insurance for small business it eliminates preconditions so every american can buy insurance it offers the same tax break for the selfemployed that large corporations get it is a bill which has malpractice reform to lower the cost of defensive medicine and which eliminates antitrust problems for hospitals so that they can work together to buy the best equipment and to cooperate in community health programs we believe that affordable health care now is a start but i believe further that if secretary bentsen were assigned the job of negotiating a health bill with his background on the senate finance committee that we could in fact draft a health bill which would pass the house and the senate and which would become law and which would have an overwhelming majority favoring it there is an opportunity for bipartisanship i also believe that on crime the country wants very strong measures taken particularly on violent crime congressman bill mccollum and congressman gerona gexas have been real leaders in developing the right kind of approach to look up violent criminals to build more prisons to provide longer sentences to have honesty in sentenoing to have an effective believable death penalty there are a number of steps we could take on crime that i think would have a bipartisan majority if the president would only help put it together i also think that it is possible for us to look at truly reinventing government the fact is we are going through an enormous information revolution we are going through a period of tremendous change in which it is possible to provide more goods and services at lower cost it is possible to use computers and information technology to use fiber optics and satellites that there are many many steps that can be taken to improve the quality of government without making it cost more but i believe that we have to face a central question here when i am asked is it possible to have bipartisanship my answer is yes if that bipartisanship is based on principles that are at the center of american life now what i mean by that is that if you go out and you ask the american people what they really believe in they are actually remarkably common sensible about 75 percent to 78 percent of all americans want a balanced budget in their government because they know they have to have a balanced budget in their business and their family about 77 percent of the american people believe in the death penalty as an effective deterrent for hardened criminals eightyone percent of southern blacks and 79 percent of southern whites favor a work requirement for welfare including for women with young children about 78 percent of all americans believe in voluntary school prayer and believe that beginning the day with a voluntary prayer is a good thing not a bad thing when you go through item after item after item the number of americans who believe that we should adopt much tougher laws on illegal aliens that we should stem the tide of illegal immigration an effort which in the house has been led by republicans such as congressman byron galleoly of california and congressman lamar smrrk of texas congressman hemy bonlla of texas and congressman bill mccollum of florida overwhelmingly americans believe americans of all backgrounds including first generation immigrants believe that while we should defend unprotected rights of legal immigration we should be much sterner and much tougher toward illegal aliens and we should be effective in protecting this countrys border from illegal immigration again and again we find this 75 percent 78 percent 80 percent 82 percent majority that consistently has a broad sense of values that would make sense and that i regard as the center of american policy in that framework if the president emphasized the new democrat part of his administration if he emphasized the reinventing part of his administration if he emphasized the part that emphasizes change i believe in that framework that it is possible for us to really make a difference but in order to understand the potential for that kind of bipartisan centrist effort to replace the welfare state by genuinely reforming things i think it is necessary to look at some of the steps that ought to be taken and i would simply suggest that until we are prepared to look at those steps nothing is going to happen let me mention an example of an area where there is i think tremendous bipartisan support for change but it is change which seems to be difficult to get in a congress in which trial lawyers have too much power we need malpractice reform we need liability reform today our legal system has become a tax on working americans every american pays a little more because we have a litigation system which is very destructive edwsars deming who fathered the quality movement and the man who taught the japanese a set of profound knowledge on quality asserted in his book out of the crisis that reforming our litigation system was one of the two most important steps we could take to improve the american economy the other was reforming health care now let me give some examples where a recent study of what the litigation tax and think of all of these extra government requirements for lawsuits as a tax a government required expenditure of your money and recently and i believe this was reprinted in one of the news magazines a study came out that looked at the litgation box here is what it found out if you go and buy an 8foot aluminum ladder and pay 119 in retail price the true cost of that ladder is 395 you are paying in effect a 24 litigation tax that is the manufacturer of the ladder the wholesaler who moved the ladder and the retailer who is selling you the ladder are paying between them 24 in insurance against the cost of liability lawsuits so you could buy the ladder for 95 but the american litigation system the liability lawsuits that you read about are costing you an additional 325 it gets to be bigger when you get to a heart pacemaker the current retail price for a heart pacemaker averages 18 000 the true cost is 315 000 the litigation tax is 3 000 that means that every person who is buying a pacemaker for their heart is paying 3 000 for the lawsuits the liability and malpractice litigation that is all too common in america a 2day maternity stay the retail price averages s3 s67 the true cost is 2 867 because there is a litigation tax an extra charge to make up for the cost of malpractice insurance of 300 just two more examples a tonsillectomy retail price is 578 the true cost is 387 the litigation tax is 191 a motorized wheelchair retail price is 1 000 true cost 830 litigation tax 170 let me go through and summarize again just so you understand how big the opportunity is to help the american economy by lowering the cost of goods making it easier to export and create jobs and lowering the cost to consumers i am going to repeat what we are paying in a litigation tax in malpractice insurance and litigation insurance and liability insurance and in lawsuits for the way we have a lawyerdominated political system and here is an area where i believe we could have bipartisan reform in trying to pass a malpractice and liability reform and we could put together a bipartisan coalition of republicans and democrats if only the clinton administration would work with us here are the tax numbers i mentioned an 8foot aluminum ladder you are paying a litigation tax of 24 for a heart pacemaker you are paying a litigation tax of 3 000 for a 2day maternity stay you are paying a litigation tax of 5500 and for a motorized wheelchair you are paying a litigation tax of 170 all of that could be changed dramatically with a bipartisan democrat and republican effort to bring together votes from both parties to pass real reform at the center let me give you a couple more examples a bipartisan opportunity that i think could help us i believe we could reshape our foreign service so it helps americans create local jobs through world sales i believe for example that we ought to introduce the idea and i am preparing legislation to have a special ambassador for exports to japan i think the japanese market is so big and the invisible barriers to trade are so great that we ought to have an ambassador whose only assignment is to work on trade with japan and i would like to see somebody like bob galvin the former leader of motorola one of the greatest export salesmen in the world someone who is a mature senior exporter who has practical experience in a large corporation selling in the japanese market become the special ambassador for exports whose only job would be to get up every day and to find new ways to sell american goods in japan creating american jobs here at home there will be a bipartisan initiative that i would hope we could pass on a joint republicandemocrat basis second i believe that we ought to design a new system where before a foreign service officer became an ambassador they were given a 1year sabbatical to work in an american export company that is for 1 year we would allow them and in fact require them to get to work learning what an export company is like what it is like to sell american goods around the world so that when they became an ambassador they would have had a practical commonsense real understanding of the world of sales because it is by selling goods around the world that we create jobs here in the united states i believe that would be something where we could in fact work together and where we could create the opportunity for americans to see the congress succeed as democrats and republicans work on a bipartisan basis to pass that kind of change my point is that there is a lot that can be done on a bipartisan basis last night did not have to be the only opportunity for us to work together but the democrats who have been in control of the house for 40 years and who now control the house the senate and the white house i think need to understand an old saying of a democratic president lyndon johnson used to say that if you wanted him to be in on the landing he wanted to be in on the takeoff what he meant by that is that he wanted to share in designing the plan not just voting for the plan he wanted a chance to have inputin how everything was put together not just have an input at the very end on whether to vote yes or no i believe that if the president would set up some bipartisan task forces that we could in fact have a number of bipartisan efforts that would get votes on both sides of the aisle republicans and democrats together to pass them i am very encouraged in that sense by a meeting that the gentleman from illinois the republican leader and i had recently with two senators senator kerrey of nebraska and senator danforth of missouri they have taken the lead in developing with president clintons help a bipartisan commission on entitlement reform this is a commission to look at the whole area of entitlements things which have been written into law so that people automatically are supposed to be getting and what they are going to try to do on a bipartisan basis is review all the ways the federal government automatically spends money on individual entitlements now there is a bipartisan opportunity which if we can pursue it together and if we can find some commonsense solutions at the center i think could be very effective i would hope that over the next few months the american people will see us working together on that area so let me just summarize i believe we could have a bipartisan effort on health i believe we could have a bipartisan effort on economic growth and job creation and after the passage of nafta i think it is more important than ever we do that i believe we could have a bipartisan effort on crime i believe we could have a bipartisan effort on illegal aliens i believe it is possible for us to work together on reinventing government to apply the principles of the information revolution and the contents of alvin tofflers third wave and edwards demings concepts of quality and profound knowledge to truly have a revolution in the cost and quality of government i believe it is possible for us to work together on a bipartisan basis to save the inner city i am prepared and i think the gentleman from illinois and the entire republican leadership is prepared to work to have a genuine bipartisan effort next year if that is the direction the clinton administration wants to go then it is important from the very beginning in planning next years budget in looking at next years legislative initiatives and developing the state of the union in a broad range of areas it is very important that we be bipartisan from the beginning it is very important that we work together i found frankly the last few weeks a very positive experience i found working with the clinton administration on the north american freetrade agreement to be a good thing i thought it was good for america to have democrats and republicans working in the same room trying to pass the same bill trying to get something done i think it would be tragic if the administration now felt that it had to move to the left that it had to become partisan and that it could not continue that tradition and so i wanted to take just a few minutes this evening to encourage my friends on the democratic side of the aisle to encourage the clinton administration to continue this experiment in bipartisan effort and i wanted to pledge on behalf of house republicans that we would like to work together to see if we could not cut spending increase the penalties against violent crime stop illegal aliens from coming into the united states pass a good health bill that would work and that would help americans and create jobs and economic growth so america can compete in the world market we are pledged that we will work in that kind of a bipartisan way if we can get cooperation from the democratic leadership and if the clinton administration is willing to continue this experience in bipartisan effort"], [0.09033820778131485, 0.09033820778131485, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i support the chapman amendment i want to say why and what i think is good about it and what may not be quite enough that is in it first of all the underlying bill is deficient in ways that need to be remedied in terms of prison grant programs to try to correct the problem of too many people in state prisons around this country and not enough room to keep the repeat violent felons it is a very difficult problem because the underlying bill does not a provide enough money or b provide any real teeth in requirements that states move their laws along in return for getting the money to the point where they actually abolish parole for repeat violent offenders the problem is we have 6 percent of the criminals in this country committing about 70 percent of the crimes and serving only an average of about onethird of their sentences it is this group of people getting out again and again and again to repeat their crimes that are the key problem that the american public wants us to address across this nation right now with crime legislation anything else we do here today or tomorrow is not going to resolve the problem the american public sees if we do not move the states in the direction of actually implementing truth in sentencing and getting rid of the opportunity for these violent felons to get back out on the street to repeat their crimes what the gentleman from texas is doing in his amendment is first of all providing an adequate amount of money about 10 billion is what we have been told by the experts is what will be required to build enough prison space in this country to put violent felons away who are repeat offenders and keep them there for the full duration or at least 85 percent of their sentences to that degree i applaud particularly this amendment second i believe this amendment goes a long way to encouraging the states to do some of the things they should do by saying they must demonstrate they will increase the percentage of convicted violent offenders sentenced to prison increase the average prison term actually served and increase the percentage of the sentence to be actually served in prison however as the gentleman from texas knows i do not think his amendment goes far enough which is why i am offering one a little bit later to correct what i think are deficiencies still in his he does say they must show evidence ofgood faith that they are doing these things and maybe they may show good faith by going to an 85percent rule in other words by abolishing parole and by doing some mandatory sentences for violent felons and by changing their pretrial detection laws they may do that but there is no requirement in the proposal offered by the gentleman from texas that states actually go to an 85percent rule for those who are convicted of serious violent felonies there is no requirement for them to be eligible to get prison construction money that they do so and i think that that is a very very big deficiency in this amendment that is why a little bit later as i said i am going to offer an amendment that will do that that will say to put some teeth in this and say to the states that you must in order to get prison grant money from the federal government change your laws to do this however i want to point out to my colleagues that the chapman amendment is a freestanding amendment it does not substitute for the underlying language in the bill it would not be in any way affected by an amendment i am going to offer in a little while or the substitute by the gentleman from new jersey to mine it is totally a freestanding addition to this bill it adds 10 billion to it it is a constructive amendment it moves us somewhat in the direction of truth in sentencing i wish he had left his original language the way it was in the original bill but i support the amendment the way it is now and i urge that it be adopted i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.09189300984144211, 0.09189300984144211, 0, "this afternoon the topic of my special order will be before we raise taxes i want to emphasize theopoint that before we raise taxes we need to examine carefully every aspect of government as my colleagues know this is a city washington where the objective need to raise taxes is almost overwhelning and every time we turn around somebody has a new reason why we need to raise taxes and they always talk in sort of casual terms we need 10 billion here 15 billion there a littie consumer tax wouldnt hurt anybody 20 billi6n 30 billion there i want to suggest that we are all forgetting because of the nature of government language that this is about real money involving real families and that it is a question to go back to president clintons inaugural address of who sacrifices first and it is fine to talk about sacrifice but somehow it always turns out to be the working american the taxpaying american the retired american who sacrifices and the government bureaucracy and the government employee unions and the trial lawyers who do better and better i would suggest that this is a real test of the family budget versus the government budget and which one is more important to those of us who have been elected now we talk about a billion dollars that dulls the senses because the truth is no family budget in america is at the billiondollar level even billionaires are only down in the 50 or 100 million a year level and for normal americans 100 is a lot of money a 1 000 is an enormous amount of money as my colleagues know at 1 000 we are talking about helping our child go through college at 1 000 we are saving up for a down payment on a house or a car at 1 000 we are talking about a lot of money for most americans and at 1 million we are talking about a thousand families talking about 1 000 and when we get to 1 billion we are talking about a million families with 1 000 each so it is very important to get these discussions down to real amounts for most people 5 is real 50 is real 100 is real but 1 billion is just government and so we sort of get numb it is almost like an anesthetic when we start talking about billions of dollars we sort of forget what is really involved the decisions we will make this spring on who sacrifices on whether we decide to change the government or to change the family budget on whether the real choices need to be made back home by working americans in their homes and their businesses or whether the real changes need to be made in washington by the bureaucracies and the welfare state these go to the core of where we are at i believe there are three very large very tough questions that need to be answered before we raise taxes we need to ask first are we using the money we already have wisely enough to morally justify asking our american families for more money we need to ask second even if the system is efficient are we in fact doing what the american people want us to do with their money and third we have to ask if we want to cut the deficit is raising taxes the right answer or will a tax increase so weaken the economy that it will kill jobs cripple revenues and increase the deficit all three of these questions i think need to be answered before we raise taxes now let me start with the question are we using the money we already have wisely enough to morally justify asking other americans to take money out of their families i just want to suggest that anybody who comes to washington and watches the federal bureaucracy for a couple of days will understand that we do not have the moral right to ask american families to tighten their belts to send the money to washington anybody who has watched the frugality of a small business that carefully monitors everything it is doing in order to stay in business or who watches the family that carefully saves pennies and decides whether or not they can afford to go to a movie and whether it has to be the twilight movie that is 3 50 rather than the evening movie at 7 understands that for most americans in tight times there are real decisions about saving even a few dollars and when you come to washington or any aspect of the federal government you can see that we are nowhere near the kind of frugality we need i recently last monday did a speech entitled renewing american civilization i talked about applying five pillars of freedom quality technological advance entrepreneurial free enterprise the principles of american civilization and psychological strength let me say that three of those quality as defined by edward demming the concept of profound knowledge technological advance using technology to do things better faster for less and entrepreneurial free enterprise using the basic principles of the free enterprise system those three pillars could dramatically lower the cost of the federal government imagine for example if president clinton were to invite 5 or 6 or 8 or 10 of the top corporate downsizers to the white house people who had downsized ford downsized ibm downsized xerox people who are in the process of downsizing sears roebuck and said to them if the key is to save money in bureaucracy and if modern computers and modern information systems allow us to save money in bureaucracy what have you learned by doing it to a bureaucracy of a hundred thousand that i can now apply to a bureaucracy of 2 million what would the department of agriculture or the department of labor look like or the department of health and human services look like if we applied the same downsizing principles for that matter what will the pentagon look like if we require it to go through the same quality transformation that say the ford motor co or xerox has gone through what we know is we would have a lot fewer bureaucrats and a lot fewer offices shuffling a lot fewer papers what we know is we would be dramatically less expensive and we would be in a position to talk seriously about how much less the federal government would cost let me also suggest that when you look at what we are subsidizing in waste waste in education in places like the new york city school bureaucracy or the washington dc school bureaucracy waste in the unionized work rules of philadelphia and detroit and new york the kind of institutionalized waste of money it makes no sense there was one report last year that in philadelphia the union work rules literally required three people at the philadelphia airport to change a ltghtbulb because one person had to come and take the various lighting fixtures off a second person had to come to change the bulb and a third person had to come to sweep around the area after the first person put the light fixtures back on now we cannot afford that kind of waste in government i recently talked here about the problem of the new york city custodians who are given a brandnew jeep every 5 years by the school board and if they do not use the jeep at the end of 5 years they get to take it home as a personal vehicle and then they get a new jeep so all the alternatives in the new york city system are for nonuse of the jeep so it can become a personal vehicle with minimum miles on it and minimum waste and there was the recent custodian for the public schools in new york city who was indicted because he was sitting on his yacht when he was collecting money for supposedly cleaning up the school my point is that there is a tremendous amount of reform in local state and federal government that is needed before we raise a penny in taxes let me go a step further and suggest that precisely what made americas biggest corporations inefficient and ultimately economically insecure was their unwillingness to go through dramatic change general motors would be a healthier company today if over the last 10 or 15 years it had gone through change and sears and roebuck would be a more competitive company today if over the last 10 to 15 years it had gone through dramatic change now we see the private market forcing change at that level we see what is happening to these corporations in order to stay alive they have got to become leaner more competitive and more customer oriented yet what do we hear from the government not any talk about dramatic bold change not any talk about dramatic management reforms not any talk about downsizing the bureaucracy instead what the government says is that we really cannot change anything except in your pocketbook we cannot threaten any of the public employee unions we cannot talk about changing any of the bureaucracies we cannot think about changing the civil service laws or the personnel laws or the procurement laws all we can think about is getting more money out of working americans but before we raise taxes i think we owe it to the american people to apply the same management toughness to government that we are seeing applied throughout the private sector there is a second question we need to ask before we raise taxes even if the system is efficient and i do not believe it is or even if we went through that process of making it efficient are we in fact doing what the american people want us to do there is a very simple test of this which congressman bob walker of pennsylvania has put in the record it is a bill that would allow all taxpayers to set 10 percent of their tax aside to go directly to the debt they could set aside anything from 0 up to 10 percent let us say you paid 3 000 in federal taxes under the walker proposal you could designate anything from 0 up to 300 to go to the federal debt and the congress would receive an instruction to lower federal spending by the same number of dollars the congressional budget office suggested that congressman walkers bill would probably balance the budget within 5 years based on public opinion polls of how many people would be using the 10 percent deficitcutting mechanism but notice what it says it says that you do not have to pay for any more government that you think is wasteful or that you think is not useful it says that you could make decisions to force the congress to cut the size of the aggregate federal government i think that is a very useful idea and a better idea than raising taxes so one of the things we ought to look at is before we get around to tax increases before we raise taxes passing congressman walkers 10percent deficit setaside to allow the american people to vote by their pocketbooks on how much of their taxes up to 10 percent could go to reducing the deficit and forcing the government to set priorities let me carry it a step further what if we were to set priorities what if we were to say to the american people here are the 30 least important bureaucracies in washington could we close them down what if we were to say here are the 20 least important programs not that they are not good programs if you have a milliondollarayear income it is amazing what you can do that you would not do if you have a 20 000ayear income you do not need as many priorities and you would not have to make nearly as many tough decisions at a million dollars a year what we have in washington is a congress and a government which has an openended idea about how much they want to spend but has a fairly limited actual amount of revenue coming in and the deficit is the gap between our unwillingness to set priorities and the size of the real revenue if we were to actually test the system here is what we would find out eightyone percent of the american people want us to replace welfare with workfare it is an astonishing number eightyone percent of the people agree that we need to require people to work if they get money that by the way would dramaticallyohange the cost of welfare yet we are hearing talk that we ought to raise taxes on working americans to subsidize the welfare system and take care of people who are not working that is something 81 percent of the people object to seventyfive percent of the american people believe we ought to have malpractice reform and tort reform so we would have fewer lawsuits and fewer gigantic settlements and so we would have less litigation that would save more than 5 billion and the estimates go on up to 30 billion or 40 billion a year it would save money oa defensive medicine it would save money in lawsuit costs it would save money in court costs and it would save money across the board in terms of not having to pay professionals to do extra things just to be prepared to defend ourselves we ought to pass malpractice and tort reform before we talk about raising taxes then we come to an area where people do not want change and yet it is one of the areas that the democratic administration is talking about changing i am fascinated by this this is a wire story which was brought to my attention just a few minutes ago it talks about president clintons economic aides and i want to share this with my colleagues this is an associated press story in the first word of what clintons longdiscussed proposal will look like clintons aides said the presidents package would consist of 16 billion in immediate spending increases for fiscal 1993 which runs through sept 30 in addition the package will contain 15 billion worth of investment tax credits a tax break given businesses that invest in equipment there is no word in that story about any offsets this is a 31 billion increase in the deficit we remember that ross perot ran promising to cut the deficit and bill clinton ran promising to cut the deficit he was going to cut the deficit in half in his first 4 years the first proposal we are now hearing is a 31 billion increase in the deficit if my memory serves me that is around a 9percent increase on the current total deficit projection so we are going to actually increase the deficit on the way to decreasing the deficit does that not sound like something we have all lived through before where the politicians promise anything to get elected and then rapidly begin to figure how they are not going to do any of the things they promised we notice also that the new term in washington is investment investment has replaced pork barrel it is a good washington word and people who love big government and love the welfare state believe if they run around chanting investment long enough people will not notice that investment is just a new word for spending the article goes on to say thisand i am quoting from the associated press story that came over the wire a few minutes agothe administration officials spoke of a raft of upperincome taxes that arwe under consideration the official said in addition panetta spoke of the need for a shared burden in deficit reduction the off icial said although he did not specify what he meant the former house budget committee chairman has been an advocate of finding savings in the social security program panetta has been a supporter of one proposal under consideration the elimination of next years costofliving increase for the nations 41 million social security recipients the article goes on to say this also under consideration is a plan cc tncrease the amount of taxes social security recipients would have to pay on their benefits many senate democrats prefer that alternative since only the v4 bestoff retirees pay any taxes at all now notice this what are they talking about here when they talk about the concept of shared burden in deficit reduction now this is the democratic office of management and budget the director of the budget shared burden does not mean cutting the size of government notice this is an article saying they are going to increase the size of government by 16 billion so the bureaucracy the politicians the pork barrel recipients they are not going to suffer any shared burden shared burden according to this article is going to mean people on social security paying more taxes or alternatively people on social security having to give up part of their costofliving increase or even the elimination according to this consideration of the elimination of rext years costofliving increase now let me point out the one government program people actually seem to like is social security it is the one program where grandchildren seem to think it is reasonable to pay to help their grandparents grandparents are grateful they are getting money parents are glad that they are in a situation to help their own parents who are now retired and there is a social contract which is very deeply held this is the one program also by the way which has a very tiny bureaucracy we send out more social security checks with fewer civil servants than almost any other program in the government so which program do our friends in the democratic administration want to hit social security notice also to receive social security you actually were working you were actually putting money away you were actually paying the social security tax so once again who is going to get it in the wallet it is the working american in this case it is the retired version of working americans meanwhile is government going to get smaller no according to this article the very first step that the clinton administration wants to take is to increase the size of government by 316 billion exactly the wrong step here wehave not even the usual fig leaf let us vote for a tax increase and we will have smaller government because we will cut spending by the way that fig leaf is never kept the average over the last 20 years is that for every dollar of tax increase there is a 1 58 increase in spending but that is not the key here the key here is that you have an administration which is saying let us raise spending and raise taxes now what does that mean that means less money for retirees it wreans less money in social security it means less money in the private sector it means less money for families but it means a lot more money for bureaucrats a lot more money for politicians to give away as pork barrel and a lot more money for the public employee unions to be able to organize people now i think that it is very important for the american people to understand up front exactly what is at stake here this is the first shot in what is going to be a 4year process of the democrats attempting to raise taxes on working americans and retired americans to transfer the money to politicians and bureaucrats to have a larger welfare state and a bigger welfare system it is explicitly wrong and as long as the welfare state keeps growing i think we have an absolute obligation to fight any tax increase so before we raise taxes let us overhaul the entire welfare state let me go to the third question even if we were doing the right things and we were doing them efficiently would we want to cut the deficit by raising taxes or will tax increases so weaken the economy that in fact a recession will come on jobs will be killed revenues will go down and the deficit instead of decreasing will increase now notice everywhere around the world we are telling people who are trying to make a transition from big centralized governments that they ought to decentralize we are telling boris yeltsin in russia we are telling menem in argentina salinas in mexico privatize parts of your government shrink your bureaucracy go back to the free market go back to private property and yet here in washington we have all too many people in the democratic administration who are talking about bigger government bigger bureaucracy mora programs and higher taxes i believe that that will in fact kill the current recovery and put us back in a recession it might take 1 or 2 years but it will happen it will happen first because as they increase the size of government you are going to see interest rates go back up and you are going to see the inflation rate go back up i am now prepared to predict having watched for a couple of weeks we are now very very close to the low point for both inflation and interest rates we are at a 20year low it has taken us 12 years to recover from carters inflation it took a tremendous amount of pain both in the recession of 198182 and in the recession of 199091 but finally we are at the lowest interest rates for home mortgages the lowest longterm unitedstates bond rates and the lowest inflation rate we have seen in 20 years the result we now have liberal democrats promptly promising bigger spending bigger government higher taxes which will lead to more inflation and higher interest rates and i will be very prepared a year from now or 2 years from now to come back here to the house floor and defend that projection and look at what inflation and interest rates look like at that point i feel some confidence in talking about the economy because on august 22 1990 1 spoke at the heritage foundation on a speech entitled the was ington establishment versus the american people a report from the budget i want to take page 9 of that particular speech and share with people what i said in 1990 because i think we are right back in the same situation economic dangers i believe that we have to then take this analysts and look at a very real danger which can cause all of us enormous pain and that is a recession the world that existed at the beginning of the budget summit is over i went on to talk about the seizure of kuwait and what is happening in iraq we have the fact absolute fact in my judgment that the economy is clearly weaker today than it was a year ago and i want to make a point that is not made often enough in this city a recession is the worst enemy of a balanced budget if we have a recession and we have millions of americans put out of work the net effect of not paying taxes because you dont have a job and increasing unemployment and welfare because you need it will be to dramatically widen the budget deficit but there is a second hidden whammy now and that is the cost of the savings and loan bailout the government is now the largest seller of property in america therefore it has a greater interest than any other person or group in keeping property values up because if property values crash the cost of liquidating the properties goes up astronomically avoiding a recession now given those two objective realities and combining with them a caring humanitarian view that argues that a job is the best welfare program the number one goal on september 5th when the congress returns should be to adopt a proposal which will avoid a recession and for the life of me i cannot see how any member of congress or any member of the government could argue for anything else in terms of domestic policy we must be strong in the middle east and we must be strong in the american economy i believe we should have a tax cut package because we know what doesnt work and we know what does work in the 1970s we tried raising taxes going into a recessionthis was the famous hoovercarter policy and it didnt work in the early thirties didnt work in the seventies turns out when you raise taxes going into a recession you get a depression if youre unlucky and you get a very deep recession if youre lucky we also tried a different technique in the eighties called lowering taxes lowering taxes seemed to have a better effect than raising taxes now i am not an economist or a political scientist so i dont have any kind of linear projection here but as a historian i am willing to suggest that we would rather be like the eighties than the seventies now this is in washington by the way a very radical statement im serious large parts of washington want to raise tayes precisely to repudiate the eighties this is an act of purification and liberal democrats want to be able to go home and say you see we have finally done away with all the wicked things that ronald reagan did and now youll be safe and theyll say this to very long unemployment lines let me make the point that i said this on august 22 1990 and we were discussing at that time a situation in which we were in a budget summit and all the establishment figures of washington were saying raise taxes raise taxes as we all know president bush tragically gave in we raised taxes and what was the result it was exactly what i said in august 1090 recession was deeper the unemployment was longer the deficit grew bigger government revenues declined fewer people were at work they paid fewer taxes the result was the government had less money and the net result was a bigger debt and a worse economic situation sadly the final result was the defeat of president bush who finally looked back in august 1992 and said in houston at the republican convention that in fact it had been a great mistake to raise taxes in 1990 well let me just suggest to you that this is still a great mistake this economy is much weaker than its macro numbers when you see general motors talking about laying off thousands of people when you see sears talking about laying off thousands of people when you see ibm talking about laying off thousands of people when you see additional burdens being put on small business the fact is objectively we are a very fragile economy the german economy is in trouble the japanese economy is in trouble if we have one or two unexpected shocks we are going to go back into a recession now we have a very painful very hard bought gradual slow recovery under way and any effort to increase the deficit with bigger government spending is going to raise interest rates and that is going to weaken the economy and any effort to raise taxes is going to weaken the private sector and that is going to weaken the economy and the result is going to be more people out of work yet the fact is that in washington those obvious common sense historic lessons do not seem to get through to people i made that point on page 12 in the 1990 heritage speech when i said washington against america and we need to look at this city as a city which is almost totally out of touch with the american people today a city which has rejected every presidential election since 1968 in both parties they rejected the republicans and they rejected jimmy carter and then they rejcted more republicans this is a city which is proud that it has withstood all the screams of the american people for lower taxes less government and a replacement for the welfare state i think i could say that paragraph today and include bill clinton as well as jimmy carter what did we have last fall we had a presidential campaign in which a thirdparty candidate one of the most powerful of the 20th century campaigned against the deficit said we had to cut spending in washington we had to cut the deficit and what do we see we see the very first clinton socalled stimilus package giving the politicians and the bureaucrats 16 billion in bigger deficit because they are going to spend 16 billion more in washington we have as i said in 1990 a rejection of lower taxes by the washington power structure which wants higher taxes a rejection of lees government by the washington power structure which wants more government and a rejection of the concept of replacing the welfare state where workfare is supported by 81 percent of the american people by liberal democrats who in fact favor the welfare state now in that framework let me suggest that there is a book which has been a best seller which is worth looking at by folks by harry figgle jr with gerald swanson called bankruptcy 1995 the coming collapse of america and how to stop it this is a very powerful book which talks about deficits it is a book which talks about the need to cut spending and the need to cut the deficit i want to share with you a couple of key points that mr figgle and dr swanson make in their book this is a current best seller he talks about the budget reconciliation act of 1990 this lethe act which was passed against my opposition after the speech i made at heritage in august it was a deal made in october by the power structure of the city of washington to prop up the welfare state by raising taxes on the american people this from pages 59 to 61 is what mr figgie says"],

points of order and would not be in order under an open rule there were two of them that could be that do not violate the rules of the house and that in fact could be offered here today as we have pointed out time and again the gentleman from illinois mr fawells concern over those 4 or 5 projects was arrived at by offering motions to strike it has also been said by my good friend the gentleman from upstate new york and a couple of others that there are 135 give or take a few legislative amendments on this bill and that special treatment was given therefore to members of the committee on appropriations which is not fair to other nonappropriations members in the house i want members to understand what we are talking about here what those 135 socalled amendments are most of them are provisions that have been in place for years and that simply allow agencies to continue past operations we believe that only 21 provisions of the 135 are new that have been proposed by the committee and could be considered in any way as real legislative amendments most of those 21 make very minor or technical changes in the law the eight that are more significant are as follows just so members know what the complaints are about and what we protected so members do not think that members of the committee on appropriations have some special privilege of sneaking their own individual amendments into this bill one would allow for both white collar and blue collar pay raises the second would require a report on internal revenue service tax system modernization the third would require a report from the drug czar a fourth would make funds available for construction projects not authorized by law the fifth would require new courthouse projects to meet certain standards the sixth would allow agencies to finance recycling through the sale of recycled materials the seventh would provide leave for federal employees donating bone marrow or organs the eighth would require reductions in staff when implementing buyout legislation those are the eight major ones and not all those are major of the 21 new the vast majority of the 135 that people keep alluding to fall into 2 other categories one agencies without authorization which the gentleman from iowa quite properly alluded to and the second are socalled good government provisions the agencie s without authorization which need to be protected under the bill and which the gentleman from iowa was urging protection for yesterday are the mint customs drug czar federal law enforcement training center national historical publications and records commission the federal elections commission merit systems protection board office of government ethics and administrative conference of the united states finally the socalled good government provisions which would permit agencies to use funds to operate and maintain buildings purchase improvements automobiles equipment and provide awards require reports on controversial spending items and allow transfers among accounts those are the 135 to the best of the committee on rules knowledge no one had any problems with any of them none of the testimony yesterday before our committee spoke to any of them all of the testimony that we had and which has been alluded to and repeated today has been on behalf of amendments which violated the rules and therefore were not made in order we made in order no proposed amendments that violated the rules we are offering instead as we thought our good friends on the other side wanted and have been asking for and too often they are right and we have not sometimes in the pat been so fair about these rules as wp ought to have been we are trying now to be more fair we have proposed here an open rule why is it that our good friends

administrations original proposal in regards to reinventing government over the years i have made that point and supported efforts and i might add unsuccessful efforts to do just that but i think this sends an effective message not only do we need reform of the merchant marine to come of assistance to the merchant marine if you will but also to reform the way that the merchant marine is doing business several years ago in the heat of the cargo preference debate and some of them have been rather heated the point was made that if we wanted to expand food aid to the starving we could do so by eliminating cargo preference requirements and ship more commodities to the aid recipient countries boy did that get the attention of the merchant marine lobby and their supporters in the congress to this point some in this body at that particular time admonished members of the committee on agriculture that if we are worried about tonnage shipped then we should buy our commodities from the european common market because unitedstates farm interests had priced our commodities out of the world market madam chairman that shows us that kind of statement shows us how contentious and how parochial and how partisan some of these statements can be and really how this issue can be but the agriculture committee took that message to heart the year was about 1986 and the cost in terms of total subsidies in regards to the agriculture committee or the agriculture department was about 26 billion we were going through a farm crisis at that time we have reduced as the gentleman from minnesota has pointed out the governments supporters to agriculture and to unitedstates farmers our farmers have become very competitive in the world marketplace we have reformed our programs now it is time for the merchant marine to step forward in that cold shower and enjoy a very brisk reform i would point out that the gentleman from texas has indicated the value of our merchant marine and points out we subsidize agriculture let me point out to the gentleman my good friend agriculture represents about 20 percent of the gross national product i do not know what the merchant marine represents but we are about 20 percent 1 trillion dollars worth 21 million jobs 17 percent of the work force food and fiber for the gentleman from texas his family and 128 other individuals and still we take agriculture for granted the gentleman from texas and the gentleman from massachusetts who undoubtedly enjoys breaded fish for his meals only spends 10 to 12 cents out of their disposable income dollars for food freeing up the rest of it to buy all sorts of other things we are responsible for 43 billion in exports talk about subsidizing exports 43 billion worth about the only segment of our economy that contributes to the trade deficit now i recognize the problem of the maritime industry after all they are regulated there is not any other industry in the country that is more regulated than agriculture i would like to help them in regards to the regulatory reform that they so obviously need but i would point out as senator grassley pointed out in the other body that the permonth cost of a unitedstates flagmaster in regards to the merchant marine per month cost 44 000 fortyfour thousand dollars a navy captain only gets 8 422 per month and the gentleman from iowa has a chart that he is more than willing to show in regards to the pay 44 000 a month my goodness the median household income runs about 30 000 so i think there are some things we could do as well as the regulatory reform the pennygrandy amendment does not eliminate cargo preference all it does is say to the merchant marine you have to get by on freight rates that are twice the world rate recently during the russian aid effort our united states ships owners offered to ship our commodities at three and even four times the going rate we had a good illustration of this effect this year as the department of agriculture struggled to deliver on president clintons promise to provide food under subsidized credit to russia and the other republics of the former soviet union first only a handful of suitable ships were available we probably have six or five or four that can actually ship the grain and in the end the unitedstates merchant marine could not supply enough ships and some of the grain had to be moved under foreign flags despite our best efforts when it came time to pay for the freight listen to this when the usda asked for bids from unitedstates flag carriers one of the early bids came in at 138 per ton more than five times the going world rate of 320 to 30 per ton the secretary of agriculture wisely refused to accept a freight bid that was fully onethird higher than the value of the grain to be shipped but as later bids came in the usda was forced to accept rates upward of 90 per ton three times more than the world rate in fact only once this year has a united statesflag bid to ship grain to russia come in at less than double the world rate the rates were so egregious that secretary espy was moved to question the unitedstates merchant marine fleet for their assault on the treasury mr espy called the timnf of the increase in freight rates very suspicious now as a former marine who just attended the noon ceremony of the 218th birthday of the unitedstates marine corps no one is more aware than i that sealift is a vital element in our potential military operations abroad recognizing that need this congress has year after year continued to provide yes needed subsidies for the merchant marine but after all this spending what do we have to show for it when this nation moved toward war in the persian gulf of the 460 ships that transported military materials into saudi ports the unitedstates merchant marine actually contributed sixthat is between five and sevensix ships while some 80 unitedstates flagships moved military gear under dod contract only 6 actually moved into the war zone in the face of war the shipping interests said no thanks in other words when push came to shove despite 75 years of subsidies our military forces had to depend on foreign flag vessels to move the beans bullets and bandages for our troops in the war zone one more example under cargo preference 75 percent of all foreign aid shipments must be carried on unitedstates flag vessels with the costs paid from the funds that are devoted to the aid programs now in closing let me simply say this amendment will correct a deficiency in the cargo preference section of the bill more importantly we will limit the rates charged under cargo preference to no more than twice the prevailing international rate if we all agree the unitedstates merchant marine should receive some support from the taxpayer and i agree with that surely we can agree that no one should receive more than double the competitive price for the same job madam chairman i urge members

gentlemans amendment as i read it the local governments would be required to set up a procedure to compensate those whose view had been altered and i think that this would be creating a whole new type of entitlement that we feds should not be imposing on the local government"], [0.001532137393951416, 0.4984678626060486, 1, "last month i introduced legislation to create a mechanism for the federal government to review the pricing of prescription drugs sold to american consumers today i am introducing complementary legislation aimed at particularly egregious practices in one segment of the pharmaceutical market h r 1588 the orphan drug amendments of 1993 will serve to correct a growing number of abuses under the orphan drug act an october 1992 study conducted by the office of technology assessment provides clear evidence of the need for action on this matter this ota study was recontormed this past month by an even more detailed and comprehensive ota study covering the whole of the pharmaceutical industry the earlier ota report entitled federal and private roles in the development and provision of alglucerase therapy for gaucher disease documents the gross abuse of the taxpayer and gaucher patients by genzyme inc the taxpayersubsidized developer of the drug ceredase this example of abuse under the orphan drug act is by no means an isolated case the experience with amgens epo and with genentechs proprotin if cited would be equally as illustrative a summary of the ota study follows remember as you read it that the charge to an average adult patient for this drug is about 300 000 a year needless to say this can quickly consume all of ones insurance benefits leaving the patient with no insurance protection genzyme has justified this pricing structure by stating that they provide the product free of charge after the insurance policy is exhausted as reported by the ota genzymes pricing is similar in its consequences to a policy in which patients are offered a lifetime supply of alglucerase in exchange for the value of their remaining insurance coverage and associated copayments what is the consumer to do if other medicatlions are needed it was governmentsponsored research that discovered the underlying defect causing gaucher disease it was govemmentsponsored research that devised a method for harvesting the enzyme to treat the disease it was governmentsponsored research that refined the harvesting procedure in order to greatly improve the effectiveness of the enzyme and yet this company has the gall to price this product at such an outrageous level the orphan drug act was enacted in 1983 to stimulate research for rare diseases it has been successful in achieving this goal because of these successes some would suggest that we should not tinker just leave things alone i dont believe we can sustain that attitude to stimulate research that we all desire it required that we pay any price for the 29 million invested by genzyme 214 milliona conservative estimateis returned in profits each year this return is virtually assured as a result of governmentprovided market exclusively is a 214 million annual return on an investment oneeighth that amount reasonable is this sustainable if we are to attack more than one disease inflicting our population is this return necessary to stimulate subsequent research again i do not believe we can tolerate nor afford this type of profiteering this legislation would put a cap on the amount of profits taken during the period of market exclusivity after the period of exclusivity when some competition may develop the restrictions are removed i believe this to be reasonable and workable i look forward to your support and that of my colleagues in the house as we work to make necessary changes to the orphan drug act h r 1588 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled"]]}
