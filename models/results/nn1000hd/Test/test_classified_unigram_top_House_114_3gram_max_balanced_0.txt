for those very generous remarks but also for your tremendous leadership and for staying the course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes

leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health

because it will provide vital resources and strengthen protections of this important agency the secret service agency is one of the most elite law enforcement organizations in the world and has earned this reputation by providing 140 years of unparalleled service to this nation however the secret service is facing a number of challenges including the need for more resources better training better use of technology and a better understanding of emerging threats this bill addresses each of these needs i am particularly pleased that section 14 of this bill incorporates my amendment to create an ethics program office to fully and effectively implement and administer the ethics laws regulations and policies governing secret service employees in recent years the image of this oncerevered agency has been tarnishedboth because of misbehavior of agents and performance issues that resulted in security lapses much of the negative attention on the personal behavior of secret service agents was initially prompted by the revelations in 2012 involving the solicitation of prostitutes by agents of the secret service in cartagena colombia at the time it was reported that a dozen secret service agents engaged the services of prostitutes before a presidential visit to colombia for the summit of the americas i attended that summit and was appalled to have learned of the behavior of some of the agents in my capacity as ranking member of the judiciarys subcommittee on crime and senior member of the committee on homeland security i examined the cartagena incident and met with thendirector mark sullivan to express my concern and press for strong corrective action in fact i have engaged in persistent oversight with respect to issues involving the secret service ranging from the intrusion into the white house last year to the 2009 incident in which a couple evaded security to attend a state dinner at the white house honoring the prime minister of india i have met with directors of the secret service on multiple occasions over the past several years to discuss and address performance and misconduct issues agent misconduct of the sorts that have taken place in recent years is unacceptable it is more than offensiveit jeopardizes the ability of the agency to carry out its core mission to address misconduct issues and ethical lapses by secret service personnel the managers amendment includes a provision i developed in cooperation with the secret service that will help elevate the issue of ethical conduct at the agency through the creation of an ethics program office with respect to other issues related to the protection provided by the secret service it is clear that the agency has been operating at an unacceptable level of resources the agency is understaffed at the agent and uniform division levels resulting in shifts that are too long and which leave inadequate time for training the agency also needs to better use stateoftheart technology and communications equipment all of these deficiencies contributed to the security breakdowns that allowed a man to climb over the white house fence evade secret service officers while running across the white house lawn and then run into the white house itself the goal of h r 1656 is to prevent future such incidentsand to protect against even more sophisticated threats that could result in far more harm this bill also would require that future directors of the secret service after nomination by the president be subject to senate confirmation the current director joseph clancy appears to be doing a good job in reinvigorating that agency and we do not propose this as a criticism of him or the presidents selection of him in any way however this positionas is the case with the directors of the other law enforcement components of the department of homeland securityshould be senateconfirmed reinforcing the need to appoint the most highlyqualified candidates and elevating the position in stature with the consideration of this legislation today we recognize that it is unfortunately the case that the secret service has recently failed to live up to its high standards with respect to the protection it provides our president and others by adopting the secret service improvements act we can help restore the agency so that it will be better prepared to achieve its mission"], [0.0005774199962615967,

what is called ecpa we will talk about the irs a little bit this spring most americans are going to be filing taxes their tax returns and many americans including me are concerned about the irs ability to take information from americans without their consent or without a warrant sometimes that includes emails so lets talk specifically about the concept of government seizure of emails without consent of the person who sent it or received it and without a warrant current federal law is that if somebody has an email within 6 months of when that email was sent that email to be obtained by governmentnot just law enforcement but any government agencythey have to get a warrant to seize that but as soon as that 160 days runs past 160 days the government doesnt get a warrant because the law doesnt require it i think in the spirit of the fourth amendment the fourth amendment should require that email what is email that is an electronic message sent to another person lets go back to regular mail or snail mail which some people call it if i write a letter and i seal the envelope and i put the postage on there and i send it go put it in the mailbox one of those blue mailboxes and i drop that in the mailbox the government does not have the authority to go in that mailbox and take the letter out read the letter seize the letter without a warrant so it flows through the united states postal system from wherever to wherever and it lands in somebody elses mailbox that mail generally speaking is protected under the fourth amendment because it violates the fourth amendment if government seizes it and goes into the contents without a warrant the same should apply to emails it is communication it is just done electronically but the law does not allowlet me say it another way if emails are over 6 months old americans should be aware of the fact that government may seize those emails from a private company without your knowledge without your consent and without a warrant that is why i have introduced along with representative zoe lofgren from california that the law should be that emails are protected that it is a right of privacy and it is an expectation of privacy for americans that emails be protected and that government should be getting a warrant before they seize those documents because it is a violation at least in the spirit of the fourth amendment i hope that that legislation does finally come to the floor and we get a vote on protecting the fourth amendment the right of privacy for americans when it comes to emails the same applies not only just to emails but under the circumstances it would apply to geolocation devices that the government knows where you are i think the government to keep up with you needs a warrant to stalk you throughout the united states the third thing i wanted to mention in the remaining time is a completely different issue but it has to do with drones the right of privacy we are in the drone age it is estimated that by 2030 we will have 30 000 drones over the skies of the united states 30 000 of them drones are a marvelous invention they are highly technical they can be very small you can get one at a local store that you can put in the palm of your hand no question about it there are good uses for drones right now the law is that the faa regulates the use of drones throughout the united states it may permit some it may not permit may refuse to permit them it is a bureaucratic decision by the faa congress needs to weigh in on the issue of drones and set down constitutional guidelines people need to know the rules law enforcement needs to know the rules and private citizens need to know the rules about their use of drones and basically the fourth amendment ought to apply to the use of a drone except with the exigent circumstances that already apply to the fourth amendmenthighspeed chases disasters fires et ceterabut we need some guidelines on the issue of drones congress has the responsibility to protect the fourth amendment of the surveillance of americans by either law enforcement or by private citizens and develop a standard for both law enforcement and for private citizens to know what the standard is yes there are reasons why we should use them and the law should allow those but congress needs to make the decision not the faa i have a local sheriff or the sheriff in texas where i am from he generally says he doesnt want to use drones because he doesnt know what the courts are going to decide down the road as to whether or not that use of a drone was a lawful or unlawful violation of the fourth amendment so rather than wait for the courts to decide if this specific use is or is not a violation of the fourth amendment congress needs to come up with guidelines about the design and the protection of the fourth amendment that drones can only be used in certain circumstances otherwise they are not allowed to be used because they violate the fourth amendment of the united states so those are three issues that have the right of privacy that are being i think chilled today because there is more and more government intrusion into all of those areas into the massive data of phone information information that is put on your iphone for example that is being seized can be seized without knowledge without warrant the massive amount of emails that can be seizedwe really dont know how much is being seized because over 6 months your personal email is not protected by law government agencies not just law enforcement can seize thatand then the skies will have 30 000 of those drones there needs to be some regulations within protection of the fourth amendment and we need to work with industry and government to outline what those rules ought to be to protect the fourth amendment protect the right of privacy of individuals to be secure in their homes in their papers and their effects from government intervention and government intrusion congress should set the standard for what a reasonable expectation of privacy is especially in those areas that i mentioned and the one regarding drones as well so i hope that we see some movement in this legislation once again zoe lofgren and i have introduced legislation as well as others to protect the right of individuals to be free from searches of their emails after 6 months without a search warrant we have that legislation pending as well hopefully we can rein in what i call the stalking government about stalking american citizens america is not about keeping up and following every citizen in the united states by government that is what other countries do that is what countries like the soviet union used to do that is not what america should be doing and congress needs to weigh in on this to protect individuals right of privacy under the fourth amendment which was the spark according to john adams to the american revolution that concept of the fourth amendment being violated and that is just the way it is i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0009067058563232422, 0.5009067058563232, 1, "i have an amendment at the desk the acting chair the clerk will designate the amendment the text of the

intently to our colleague from new york talk about the president needing to get up on the top of the mound and throw a perfect strike here with this deal i have seen the president throw a baseball and lord help us if that is what we need to stop this because i think we are in a major major pickle here and it has been the result of bad policies from the beginning almost 2 years ago in 2013 this house voted to increase sanctions on iran and we did that with over 400 votes on a bipartisan basis and that was really the obvious thing to do at the time because the leadership of iran the mullahs were chafing under the sanctions regime that was in place and the way to deal with a country like iran with a leadership that is dedicated to militant islam is when they are starting to chafe you turn the screws harder we did that thing we did the right thing in the senate harry reid would not bring that up for a vote the president decided that rather than that route he would simply provide unilateral sanctions relief to iran saying this is a gesture of good faith now we want you to reciprocate with your nuclear program basically from that time forward iran has said go fly a kite we are not giving up anything so the agreement we seem to be on the verge of submitting to the congress allows iran to keep their entire nuclear infrastructure the underground bunker at fordow is fortified for a missile attack why do you need to fortify a nuclear facility against a missile attack if it is for peaceful purposes so they get to keep that they have a heavy water reactor in iraq that they get to keep that is used to produce plutonium they dont need it for peaceful purposes they have advanced centrifuges that they are allowed to keep again no use for those for peaceful purposes so iran is basically in a situation where if you turn back the clock almost 2 years when this house voted those sanctions with over 400 votes if you asked iran and the iranian leadership what they most wanted they probably said well look we want to keep our nuclear infrastructure but we want to get rid of these sanctions and guess what that looks to be what is going to happen and that is going to be a very very dangerous and bad deal i do think it is worth pointing out as much as we can the nature of this regime they are not only fomenting problems in the middle east they are not only dedicated to the destruction of israel they are dedicated to the destruction of the united states the most deadly attack on unitedstates marines since iwo jima was in 1983 at the marine corps barracks in beirut when hezbollah which was supported by iran bombed and killed 220 unitedstates marines another 21 personnel that is a major amount of american blood on their hands in iraq in 2006 2007 and 2008 they were responsible for killing hundreds of our servicemembers through the shiite militias that were operating as their proxy forces and may have killed as many as 1 500 so again that is major major american blood on their hands this is a regime that has never since 1979 showed any evidence of changing or deviating from their ideologyrooted and militant islam they are a danger not only to the region but to the world we have seen now for some time since this president has taken office iran has steadily increased its influence and power in the region they are the number one actor in iraq by far they are now battling for yemen with the houthis they are the number one patron of hamas on the gaza strip they are the number one patron of hezbollah in lebanon and they are the number one patron of assad in syria and so this is a massive shiite crescent throughout the middle east and guess what when sunni arabs see our administration bending over backwards to cut deals with iran they see the shiitebacked militias that are backed by iran and iraqthe ones fighting isisthat makes the average sunni arab say you know what i am much more likely to want to join isis than have to live under shiite oppression so the presidents policy i think has been bad for expanding irans influence but i think it also has the effect of driving more sunni arabs into the hands of isis and so it is loselose policy i thank my friend from pennsylvania for having this discussion i hope that this bad deal doesnt happen but if it does we need to have robust debate in the house we need to pick apart the deal piece by piece and show how this is not something that is good for security in the world we can see that already before the deal has even been agreed to because you see an arms race in the middle east with the sunni arab states that has been underway now for some time that is a direct result of the bad policies that this administration has engaged in visavis iran so the regime in iran is an enemy of the country we need to recognize that and we need to make sure that we scrutinize any deal that comes to this congress that allows iran to maintain a nuclear capacity and that it is voted down resoundingly"]]}
