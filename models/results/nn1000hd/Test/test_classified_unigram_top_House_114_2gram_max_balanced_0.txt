throughout the world but republicans have abdicated their responsibility the zika virus the flint water crisis and the opioid addiction that is ravaging communities in the inner cities in suburban america and all throughout the rural parts of this country yet house republicans have failed not just to put forth a budget that would provide a roadmap to deal with these issues but they have chosen

include a tax hike on working families and would leave millions uninsured without any coverage at all this is not a serious proposal and more than 2 000 days after president obama signed the

really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for

racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional

disparities i would like to thank my colleagues congressman hakeem jeffries and congresswoman joyce beatty for hosting this timely special order historically racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care while the affordable care act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities for example the department of health and human services is currently working to expand access end racial and ethnic discrimination perform outreach to underserved communities improve workforce diversity and expand data collection and reporting while this is an ambitious plan it is one that is extremely necessary unfortunately coverage access and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status for example research shows that privately insured african american and hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care unfortunately african americans and hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts the same research also showed that privately insured african americans and hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs since social determinants like economic stability education and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on healthrelated programs reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing affordable food access to education job opportunities communitybased resources public safety public transportation and more our society must make many changes before we

other three pieces of legislation that we will pursue after this i dont know what it is going to take because he was on the front lines he doesnt have to conjecture i personally thank chairman goodlatte i personally thank ranking member conyers and of course our brothers in the senate senator cardin senator lindsey graham we had a press conference in april and introduced this legislation at that press conference was gina miller gina miller was the fiancee of a washington state trooper tony radulescu who was shot at a traffic stop in washington state and killed he went to high school in new jersey he was a vet from the gulf war as many of our police officers are i promised gina i would not take off the wristband she gave me until we pass this legislation it is fitting in this month when we honor all law enforcement it is fitting that we move this through the house of representatives i am honored to stand with mr reichert as we present this and i am honored and thank you all for coming on this piece of legislation we have heard the numbers about how many police officers were killed in the line of duty in 2013 and 2014 it is a grave reminder that these attacks are too common in our communities last year we mourned the loss of jersey city officer melvin santiago who was killed in the line of duty responding to a gangrelated robbery officer santiagos death set off a series of targeted threats against the jersey police officers from the assailants fellow gang members the grave risk that our law enforcement officers face was tragically confirmed this past christmas when onduty new york police department officers ramos and liu were murdered while simply sitting in their squad car when threats like this occur the rapid dissemination of critical timesensitive information is essential and the national blue alert system would provide that in new jersey and across our nation regardless of what aspect you talk of about police work law enforcement talk must be followed by action so cops the police officers just dont need a pat on the back from us while we place our grandchildren in the back of the car to see what it is like to sit in a police car they need our actions here in washington to help communities throughout america so i thank chairman goodlatte for putting this bill before us tonight and the other bills that will follow"], [0.8196154534816742,

assets as the regulatory landscape has evolved for the nations financial institutions since the financial crisis i have worked with my colleagues on the financial services committee to ensure that our community banks are not unduly burdened h r 1553 is a part of that effort as it will extend muchneeded relief to main street banks by allowing wellmanaged wellcapitalized community banks an opportunity to take advantage of an extended 18month examination cycle while bank examinations are vital to the safety and soundness of the american banking system the time and resources that banks put into preparing for and responding to examinations can be extremely time consuming particularly for smaller banks with limited staff and resources that cannot afford to divert key personnel away from their core business in order to prepare for examinations h r 1553 also allows banking regulators to better allocate their resources to financial institutions that warrant additional attention and away from community banks that have otherwise demonstrated that they are soundly managed and well capitalized i have heard from community bankers in missouri and from across the country that straightforward bipartisan commonsense regulatory relief proposals like h r 1553 can contribute significantly to community banks ability to lend to main street businesses and reinvest in our

each year at no costlet me repeatno cost to the unitedstates taxpayer including 8 315 jobs in my home state of tennessee that is around 1 4 million american jobs in the past 5 years in fiscal year 2014 exim bank supported 27 5 billion in exports and 164 000 unitedstates jobs the bank returned 675 million to the unitedstates treasury in fiscal year 2014 reducing the deficit in fiscal year 2013

make it more transparent and to make it work for them back in their districts they dont send me to washingtoni dont go home every week to my district and my constituents come to me and say stephen we wish you would shut down the government this week we wish you would end stephen the only good government programs that work we want you to abolish them they send us up here to make these things work the exportimport bank is in need of serious reforms and that is why a few months ago we started to work on a reform package our bill to reauthorize with reforms with 31 reforms to fix the bank and to make it work better and more transparent and more accountable for some reason some of my colleagues in the house have taken a very different approach they have taken a political approach that this is going to be the hill so to speak that they are going to die on and the facts dont matter all that matters are the political outside groups calling for whatever is in their best interest not the best

leadership for a short period of time because i was a new member at the time and when he would come to this floor to this well to speak as the speaker of the house his oratory was just so compelling people would stop what they were doing to listen to what jim wright had to say and how he said it in some ways that was of another era that hearkened back to how the business or the work of congress was conducted where people would come and actually listen to the debate he was a man of great oratorical skill of course a legislative master but he was also a person of great courage and a person of great principle tonight we gather on the floor to honor the memory of this great speaker of the house from the service that earned him the distinguished flying cross in world war ii to leadership that
