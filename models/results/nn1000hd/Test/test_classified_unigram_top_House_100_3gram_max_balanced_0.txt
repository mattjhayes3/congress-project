reflected in the administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding

for the contadora peace process and urges the president to resume bilateral talks with the nicaraguan government and to persuade other central american nations to join with the united states in using economic sanctions to pressure the nicaraguan government into changing its policies the single greatest issue in determining this nations policy toward the situation in nicaragua is whether or not we are willing to accept the establishment of another marxistleninist beachheadlike cubain the western hemisphere to fail to recognize the threat the sandinista government poses to the security of central america and the united states is to bury our heads in the sand the head of our own intelligence agency bill casey tells us that since 1979 when the sandinistas seized control over the government they have developed the best equipped military in the region he estimates the sandinistas have 6 000 to 7 500 cuban advisers and another several hundred other communists from the soviet union and eastern european soviet bloc countries to assist in their military buildup and consolidation of power if we allow the soviets and cubans to develop this powerful beachhead in central america and that ferment spreads our nation will know a security threat that we cannot abide clearly there is only one choice consistent with our national security and foreign policy objectives we must apply pressure from all possible sources to make the sandinistas call a ceasefire and come to the negotiating table with the democratic resistance known as the contras this will be especially difficult at a time when nicaraguas conversion to a marxistleninists state is 80percent complete they are already suppressing the press and expelling those not on their side they are arresting and imprisoning political opponents they are exporting communism to other countries they are tightening down more on the private sector and the evidence goes on down the line that the sandinistas are crs426 intent on following everything cuba has done it is also an unfortunate political reality that marxist governments do not revert to democratic forms of government not one of the some 21 countries that have gone communist have been reversed in nicaragua however there is somewhat of a unique situation a grassroots resistance movement is fighting for a democratic form of government and the same kinds of freedoms this country enjoys but the leaders of the democratic resistance emphasize shortages of food medicine and clothing which severely impede their ability to successfully wage their fight by passing the michel amendment we can encourage and help the democratic resistance continue and bestow legitimacy on their efforts thus we would send a clear message to the sandinistas and to neighboring countries whose borders have been violated that we intend to protect the freedoms and the democratic form of government in this hemisphere if we are going to provide aidhumanitarian or otherto the contras we had better do it now and in a fashion that doesnt slowly bleed them to death and diminish the strongest incentive for the sandinistas to negotiate there are those critics who charge any support for the democratic resistance will result in the united states entering the war in nicaragua with our own military forces the president himself has clearly told us his administration does not seek the military overthrow of the sandinista government or to replace it with supporters of the old somoza regime we certainly dont want another vietnam on our hands we certainly must never again get into a situation that we dont intend to win but whether or not this country would ever have to make the tough decision of military intervention is not the issue at this time lets first utilize all the peaceful means that are available through the michel amendment to try to accomplish our objective of preventing another marxistleninist beachhead we better not keep sticking our heads in the sand and say the situation in nicaragua will go away by itself because that simply will not happen its a lot easier to pay for peace now by helping those grassroots resistance forces who want freedom for themselves and are willing to fight for it than to pay for war with our own blood on a far larger scale once that beachhead has grown into a monstrous threat

on children in america a strategy for the 100th congress volume i sets forth a strategy for this congress to consider as it acts upon legislative initiatives that will have a major impact on the lives

descriptions of programs which address the need for quality education opportunities for selfsufficiency the right to a safe and livable environment and services that will ensure healthy minds and

minds and bodies and second are better able to obtain a quality education what is the current status of our child nutrition programs as the vice chairman of the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education which has jurisdiction over our child nutrition programs i believe that we have in place a strong national network of quality programs in which we can all take pride the past present and future success of our child nutrition programs is dependent on a strong federal state and local public and private sector partnership willing to invest the necessary resources to meet the nutritional needs of our nations youngsters when they are in awayfromhome settings at the heart of this network is the oldest and largest of our child nutrition programsthe national school lunch program today the national school lunch program provides nutritionally balanced meals to approximately 24 million school age children or 92 percent of all schoolchildren federal support is provided to participating school districts in a mix of cash and commodity support what level of support the federal government provides is in an inverse relationship to the economic status of the childs family the highest levels of federal support go to meeting the costs of providing meals to our neediest youngsters this is as it should be two important companion programs deserve mention the first is our school breakfast program which is designed to ensure that all youngsters begin their school day with the nutrients necessary to benefit fully from the days educational experience thanks to congressional action during the last congress i am pleased to note that modest increases in both cash and commodity assitance will now be available to improve the overall quality of the breakfast program meal patterns while our school lunch and breakfast programs play a vital part in meeting nutritional needs during the regular school year the summer feeding program complements that initiative by providing nutritious meals to our neediest youngsters during the summer months one of our fastest growing child nutrition activities is the child care food program which essentially provides meal services appropriate to youngsters enrolled in day care centers or family day care homes as more two wageearner families and growing numbers of single heads of households join our labor force the child care food progam will assume an everincreasing role in meeting the nutritional wellbeing of our younger children no overview of the status of our child nutrition programs would be complete without the mention of the special supplemental food program for women infants and childrenmore popularly referred to as the wic program wic is an early health intervention program that seeks to provide individually tailored food packages to lowincome pregnant women new mothers infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk medical services and nutrition education round out the wic program benefits wic program benefits cost an average of 30 per month in return studies clearly demonstrate that wic does make a difference in increasing the birth weights of infants of lowincome women who are at nutritional risk and the probability that these infantswill survive and enjoy a normal and healthy childhood what is the challenge facing the 100th congress in the area of child nutrition first we must see to it that the legislative changes enacted during the 99th congress are fully and quickly implemented second we must continue to take a long and hard look at all phases of child nutrition program policies and operations we cannot rest on our laurels so to speak rather we must strive to maximally utilize what will be of necessity limited resources to the end that we meet our commitment to providing for the nutritional wellbeing and improved educational opportunities afforded to all of our children what is at stake has been eloquently stated in the current offering of letters for women infants and children in the usa being conducted by bread for the world children are our future au of them while adequate diets wilu not compensate for the great differences in access to opportunity between those who have and those who do not it is a start food can enable some children to survive and many others to make better use of educational and economic opportunities food is preventative medicine providing protection from disease food assistance can limit the stress placed on parents without enough money to provide their children with the basic necessities of life it represents what is best in amerlca a dedication to our children and our future and an attempt to nip the poverty cycle in the bud"], [0.8370609879493713, 0.16293901205062866, 1,

of a free trade arrangement with japan the idea hardly originated with me rather it has the support of a number of highly esteemed experts in the area of united statesjapanese relations including the united states ambassador to japan mike mansfield as the possibility of an fta with japan became more and more the subject of discussion the international trade commission was requested to explore the advantages and disadvantages of such an undertaking the report revealed a large universe of positive ideas about such an agreement and as exports reflect further the possibility of improving the bilateral relationship seems to be gaining in popularity consequently i am determined to move the process closer to reality as our second largest trading partner with total twoway trade exceeding 100 billion developing a longterm trading relationship with japan has never been more important a free trade arrangement would provide us with the opportunity to develop that relationship by eliminating all trade barriers in both the united states and japan and establishing new mechanisms for resolving trade differences the united states will profit considerably the removal of trade tension and the overall feeling of good will which generally accompanies an agreement of this nature will finally provide the united states with our long desired free access to the japanese marketplace my bill draws on the positive features of the itc report and derives from it a very basic sot of objectives necessary for the negotiation of a united statesjapan fta chief among the negotiating objectives set forth in my bill are the removal of formal and informal trade barriers the creation of new mechanisms for dispute settlement and most importantly the improvement of market access in both countries as a means of stabilizing the bilateral balance of trade my bill also would allow both countries to determine the initiation date for negotiations by mutually agreeing to the forum structure and timetable this would assure that both countries plan to oblige themselves to reciprocal trade disciplines success in these areas will ultimately lead to the improvement of the united statesjapanese political atmosphere increased economic benefits and the advancement of other united states trade objectives rather than continue trade negotiations with japan in the adhoc manner with which we have become accustomed an fta offars both countries the opportunity to improve our political atmosphere it is likely that a dispute settlement mechanism would eliminate the friction we now experience under our current system the special trade relationship that we have gained with israel and anticipate we will achieve through the united statescanada fta will increase our willingness to reach mutually desired goals the principal reason for entering into a free trade agreement is the economic benefits it will provide to the manufacturers and consumers in the signatory countries open markets increase competition thus eliminating inefficiency which ultimately results in lower costs to the consumer there is no reason to believe that a united statesjapan fta will have anything less than the desired result additionally an fta will advance other unitedstates trade objectives our trading partners will see clearly that the united states intends to pursue the most open and mutually advantageous trade arrangements that are possible whether it be through multilateral or bilateral agreements rather than sit idly by watching the enormous economic progress of nations engaged in free trade hesitant nations will likely learn the value of joining progressive trade efforts and of contributing to improved trade disciplines worldwide the bilateral process therefore can enhance the multilateral process my purpose of exposing the advantages of an fta is not to misrepresent the itc report as indeed it too explored the disadvantages of such an agreement as well admittedly the differences in our
