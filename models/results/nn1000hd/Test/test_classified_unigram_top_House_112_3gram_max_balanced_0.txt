of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of

the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt

beyond shameful that over 45 million americans including over 16 million children are living in poverty in the wealthiest nation in the world the data also shows a wide racial disparity with the poverty rates for whites standing at 9 8 percent while the rates for african americans and hispanics remain unacceptably high at 27 6 percent and 25 3 percent respectively in 2005 i founded the

are finally beginning to dig ourselves out of the hole that was left by the bush administration and slowly moving the poverty rate in the right direction we must do more and we can do more one of the most critical responsibilities we have as a government is to promote and enact policies that keep our middle class strong and provide opportunities and a safety net for those striving and fighting to become middle class and to get into the ranks of the middle class to enhance their quality of life but far too many americans are continuing to suffer joblessness and have dropped out of the middle class and into poverty because of this republican donothing congress republicans in congress have continually blocked efforts to extend and expand vital safety net programs which safeguard millions of american families and children who face stark realities of unemployment hunger and homelessness further their continued blocking of critical federal support to our states and localities has caused

reason i have authored the tax relief certainty act which would make permanent the tax cuts established in 2001 and 2003 repeal the estate tax and provide permanent relief from the alternative minimum tax while i would have preferred this conference report was more than another piecemeal approach to tax relief the question we face today is whether this congress is going to avoid a tax increase on working families during these difficult economic times i believe that we should not allow a tax increase on working families and therefore i will support this bill i am pleased that this conference report includes important reforms in unemployment benefits as i travel around indiana small business owners in one community after another have told me about the need to reduce dependency on unemployment insurance i believe we can provide a safety net for those who have fallen on hard times while at the same time protecting the incentive to work this legislation takes an important first step toward reforming unemployment insurance by reducing the maximum number of weeks of eligibility for benefits based on a states unemployment level and creating national job search requirements for everyone collecting state and federal unemployment insurance benefits i am also pleased that this conference report contains language that will not interfere with indianas efforts to return the states unemployment trust fund to solvency the deal before us today is nothing to write home about but it does avoid a tax increase on working families during these difficult economic times and starts us down the road toward unemployment insurance reformand i urge my colleagues to support it"], [0.8549447506666183, 0.14505524933338165, 1, "i ask unanimous consent that all members have 1 legislative

place in the country now we may be reaching a point at which this should be looked at again i believe there is no discrimination now in my state i think the judiciary committee ought to look at this carefully but this is not the place to do this and it is such a sensitive issue section 5 of the voting rights act applies to jurisdictions determined to have had a history of discrimination against minority voters section 5 requires certain covered jurisdictions based on the formula set forth in section 4 to preclear their congressional redistricting plans with either the department of justice or with the unitedstates court for the district of columbia before implementation in order to be granted preclearance jurisdiction has the burden of proving that the proposed voting change neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color or membership in a language minority group litigation is pending now in the federal district court including the case of texas v holder which challenges the constitutionality of the coverage formula and preclearance requirements in sections 4 and 5 in its 2009 decision in northwest austin municipal utility district no 1 v holder the supreme court may have signaled a willingness to reconsider the constitutionality of the preclearance regime and coverage formula but this is not an amendment that i think is appropriate here again as we deal with this thing we have to be very very sensitive because quite frankly i remember in 1982 when i voted for this there were editorials in the richmond timesdispatch that were ripping me apart for this vote but because i do believe that everyone should have the right to vote i voted for it but i would also say to end we may be approaching a time that this would go because we want a nation where no one is discriminated against and we may have reached that point but i think the judiciary committee should hold extensive

troubling even though this bill only extends the program for 30 days i hope that this brief window will give our counterparts in the senate enough time to pass their flood insurance reform bill so

research at the department of energy it separates out 10 million to spend on a cooperative effort with nasa to restart the production of plutonium238 advancing the state of nuclear energy technology was the initial mission of the doe and it was hugely successful developing technologies now used in power plants submarines and deep space missions this last focus is now one of the smallest doe spends about 40 million a year building plutonium238 radioisotope thermal generators rtgs for nasa and for national security purposes this program began in the fifties rtgs flew on all of the apollo missions and many times since in deep space rtgs are often the only possible source of power unfortunately in the early nineties the unitedstates shut down plutonium238 production and since then the department of energy has been using stockpiled material and material purchased from russia to build these devices recently though russia refused to continue that relationship and our supply of plutonium238 is almost exhausted there are no other viable ways to provide this power so the unitedstates must restart production to allow any deep space or national security uses to continue this project has been requested in the last three budget requests under the bush and obama administrations over the course of 5 years the total cost of the project is estimated at 75 90 million by agreement between the agencies the project would be equally funded by nasa and the doe as nasa has the largest need for the power and the doe has the expertise and would build and maintain the facility the 10 million requested this year in the nasa budget was included in the cjs billing making its way through the appropriations committee this 50 50 cost share is consistent with the decadeslong history of the rtg program in which nasa has paid for each rtg produced for its purposes and the doe has paid for the infrastructure required in the context of the nuclear energy research budget which in fact receives a modest increase in this bill this is a very small project but it would have an outsized influence on our ability to do the kind of space exploration that no one else in
