but im not excited this is not an open rule we had an opportunity to have an open rule we called for a vote unfortunately my friends on the other side of the aisle voted against it but having said that there are a lot of different amendments in here that represent a lot of different viewpoints and so im okay with it so i will begin by saying that secondly i want to share with my colleagues that this is a good bill and it is not a boondoggle as the gentlewoman from michigan referred to it it is a necessary protection for people the question was asked well why should the government be involved in flood insurance well one of the reasons why is because the private insurance industry has no interest in providing the kind of coverage at an affordable level to people who need it if there was money to be made if they thought they could make money you could bet the private insurance industry would step up and try to fill in the void but they havent and they wont and so without this you will end up dealing with these catastrophes with disaster relief funds that congress would have to approve and thats not a very efficient or good way to deal with the issue of floods i would also like to point out that this is an important bill not only because it is bipartisan in nature but i think there is also a bipartisan consensus that it is important that we move forward with this again i want to commend mrs biggert and the members of the financial services committee i want to commend congresswoman maxine waters who worked together in a bipartisan way who produced a bill that passed 540 you dont see that very much and this has been a very contentious congress and there have been lots of partisan divides when it has come to voting on bills but in this one area there is consensus which i think is an indication that it will win broad bipartisan support in this congress so i want to thank the gentleman from texas for bringing this rule to the floor i want to thank all of those who are responsible for the underlying bill and look forward to supporting it and i hope my colleagues at a bipartisan level will support my amendment which i think is a good amendment with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.00014269351959228516, 0.5001426935195923, 1, "the longer i listen to this debate the more confusing it becomes i remember a wise man telling me once you cant get blood out of a turnip but you can slice it you can dice it whip it and do everything but it still ends up being turnip juice i rise in strong support of mr grimms amendment and i do so because there seems to be a tremendous lack of clarity its amazing how we can all read the same words but arrive at a different meaning and we can read them over and over and over again so it would seem to me that the best way to have clarity is to make absolutely certain that these agencies understand that yes they do in fact have the authority to say yea or nay yes or no to entering into project labor agreements im a strong supporter of organized labor it doesnt mean that i think labor unions are perfect oftentimes many of the people in the community where i live feel that they cannot access labor unions that they cant get in that they cant get membership yet and still i think that project labor agreements are the best way to get the quality and the assurance that were getting the best bang for the buck so

library of congress whose sole mission is to preserve the books and documents that tell our nations history the library of congress a 211yearold institution and our national library offers an incredible range of research interactive programming and innovative technologies however most would agree that books remain the fundamental components of any library since 1995 the library of congress has been conducting a specific preservation campaign to save its books the current program known as the thirtyyear mass deacidification program aims to treat and preserve millions of hardbound books paperback books manuscripts newspapers maps artworks music scores letters pamphlets and drawings the program ensures that future generations are able to enjoy the important historical artifacts that are housed in the library of congress many of the older books and papers at the library of congress are printed on acidic paper which can turn brittle and fall apart with age deacidification extends the useful life of these works for up to 1 000 years longer than their useful life without treatment delaying the acidification process means more books would deteriorate beyond repair unfortunately many old books in the librarys collection are already too brittle or in such poor shape that they cannot be preserved further we must continue the work now to maintain the remaining books that can still be saved before they deteriorate further i am offering this amendment which would restore 1 million in funding for the thirtyyear mass deacidification program at the library of congress decisions that will affect the preservation of our nations heritage and history must be made carefully we have to ensure that the library has the resources it needs to maintain its collections for example if we cut 1 million from this project for this 1 year as this legislation proposes to do the project will take an estimated 20 years longer to complete while books continue to age and lose years off their useful life furthermore the cut to this particular program is about 20 percent its disproportionate to the overall levels of cuts to expenses in other programs within the library of congress while cuts must be made this program is something that cannot be put on hold it cannot wait books will continue to decay and we will risk losing irreplaceable works that chronicle and illustrate our nations history"], [0.00030040740966796875, 0.49969959259033203, 0, "i thank the gentleman from california the president owns this economy he owns the high unemployment ratethe 23
