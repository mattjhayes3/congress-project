abusive situations that they cannot control the impact of these situations is significant and it could well result in homelessness and a loss of necessary financial resources for food maintenance and

support for the family and she was able on her own to obtain housing although it was still neither decent nor safe yet because of her financial situation she was threatened with eviction legal services helped her to get section 8 housing and the family was able to relocate to decent housing with adequate space this stabilized the family during a very disruptive and unsettling time millions of children are the victims of abuse from their parents and others who ard responsible for their care this abuse goes on somewhere in the country every minute of the day and legal services in maryland

welfaretowork which is an extremely important amendment that has been put together with this bill which is referred to as the fathers count legislation beginning on title ill of this legislation welfare to work program eligibility which was reported out favorably by the committee on education and the workforce is a bill which attempts to correct a very serious problem with the original welfare reform legislation in that legislation we attempted to be so strict in defining the eligibility of people who could qualify for welfaretowork and in setting up the requirements virtually eliminated 90 percent of the people who might otherwise have been able to participate i say that very liberally because in talking to the department of labor that administers this program they are saying that only about 10 percent of the funds have been utilized looking at the figures programs in may and june of this year they are saying that hopefully it has risen to about 13 to 15 percent which suggests to me that this legislation which we reported out of the committee on education and the workforce is an absolutely essential correction in my own state and i have talked to the people there and they say the one thing that eliminates almost all of the custodial parents from participating is the restriction that says you must not have a high school diploma or a ged and almost all of the people on welfare or the parents on welfare have their high school diplomas in my state and so they are automatically disqualified so this correction which we are making eliminating these very strict requirements is essential if we expect to take this welfaretowork opportunity to the people that really need it the second point i want to make is that the current law even the current law which has all of these defects opens up opportunity for welfaretowork opportunities and assistance and other kinds of programs to both custodial parents and noncustodial parents it is opened up completely to both aspects in fact to make sure that the noncustodial parent has an opportunity there were restrictions of funding 70 percent in one area 30percent in another it is an important point

private sector private interest group that does not really have any public accountability equally as important the main argument that the proponents of this bill have made the proponents of the scarborough amendment is that this process by turning over authority to unos that this process will actually increase the number of donations organ donations which is the goal we all aim for i would cite from the institute of medicine on page 10 the committee believes strongly that the effectiveness and productivity of organ procurement is highly dependent on good working relationships at the local level that is clearly what we need to do but they go on in spite of what we have heard from the other side to say however our committee finds no evidence that broader organsharing arrangements will lead to reduced rates of donation that if organs go farther across the country it simply does not affect peoples proclivity to donate organs what makes people want to donate organs is that they

wars and the president came out and said why do you not solve your problems locally that gave the incentive for local environmentalists local business folks local government leaders to sit in what was the quincy library group and they met there because they could not shout dt each other at a library and they actually got together and put together a forest management plan that worked for the local communities and also provided for better forest health than the current law that applied in that land now this is a wonderful plan and i think thatthe bill as it is crafted allows for flexibility in

a vote on the floor of the house passed 429 to 1 and is currently being stymied by the administration because it drives a wedge into the local and national leaders of the environmental community and the national environmental leaders are threatened for the loss of power even at the expense of a plan that provides better forest health i would submit that is really what is going on here i think it
