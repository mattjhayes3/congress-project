have indicated that they should be judged based on their capacity to complete the basics of their job responsibilities which include the passage of a budget resolution in fact it was thencongressman ryan who in 2012 stated that failing to enact a budget has serious consequences for american families there are at least three current health crises that we are trying to deal with in america and throughout the world but republicans have abdicated their responsibility the zika virus the flint water crisis and the opioid addiction that is ravaging communities in the inner cities in suburban america and all throughout the rural parts of this country yet house republicans have failed not just to put forth a budget that would provide a roadmap to deal with these issues but they have chosen to simply ignore these crises in a manner that represents such a stunning departure of what responsible members of congress should be doing at this particular point in time i am thankful that we have

force and in solidarity with the majority of americans who are demanding that congress take meaningful action to prevent gun violence we all know the statistics whether it is through mass shootings that make the headlines or the unseen violence that happens daily on our streets gun violence takes the lives of more than 30 000 of our nations citizens each year a number that far exceeds other industrial countries now all these countries have their share of violent extremists and madmen but only our country gives easy access to weapons of mass killing and that makes all the difference for america rather than seeking out commonsense solutions to address this crisis the republican majority continues to cower to the gun lobby and the firearms manufacturers now they plead the second amendment but constitutional law 101 would tell us that all of our rights including the precious freedoms of religion and speech must be balanced to protect innocent third parties and to protect the safety of the wider community one commonsense measure we should all agree on is background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill you cant shout fire in a crowded theater because of your freedom of speech and neither should you be able to buy a weapon if you have a history of violence and criminality in fact almost 90 percent of americans including the majority of gun owners support universal background checks for all gun purchases the problem is that our present background check system is rife with loopholes background checks are not required for private sales at gun shows they are also not required for internet sales bipartisan legislation has been introduced by representatives peter king and mike thompson that would finally close this egregious loophole it is an entirely sensible reform that would have a measurable impact on the safety of our schools homes and neighborhoods without preventing lawabiding citizens from using guns for selfdefense or recreational purposes despite attracting 186 cosponsors including several republicans the background check legislation has never been brought to the floor or even received a hearing in committee it has been languishing for more than 15 months meanwhile the shootings and the suicides and the massacres continue to accumulate my colleagues we must do better our fellow citizens are totally fed up both with the unspeakable killing and suffering and with a feckless congress that hasnt lifted a finger to prevent it now this week after intense public criticism and a historic protest by democrats on the house floor republicans seemed for a while to be willing to hold a vote on legislation they claim would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms after all nearly 2 500 individuals on the terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in this country but rather than embrace existing bipartisan legislation to actually fix the problem republicans put forth a woefully inadequate proposal that would require law enforcement and courts to grapple with unworkable processes unreachable standards to be completed in an unreasonably short period of time their bill would allow suspected terrorists to receive firearms by default after only 3 days if the court is unable to work through a complicated process that is the same flaw that allowed the white supremacist charleston shooter to obtain the weapon that he used to murder nine people at emanuel ame church in other words the bill is totally inadequate now under pressure from their most extreme members republican leaders refuse to even put this bill on the floor what should be on the floor is bipartisan legislation h r 1076 that would permit the attorney general to block gun sales to suspected terrorists this legislation based on a proposal from the bush justice department would still allow individuals to challenge the government in court to restore their gun ownership rights we dont have to choose between protecting our communities and respecting due process and so we ask our colleagues how much longer must we wait how many more people have to die to move us to act how many more american towns and cities must be added to the constantly growing list of places like orlando and columbine and aurora and charleston and newtown moments of

rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine

affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths

allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the

deaths in this country there were 45 000 deaths from drug overdoses many of those folks suffered from depression there were an estimated 1 200 homicides by people who are seriously mentally ill about half of all deadly police encounters occurred with someone who is mentally ill there is an unknown number of mentally ill who died 25 years sooner because they tend to die of chronic illnesses there is about one homeless person per day in los angeles who dies we know about 200 000 homeless people in this country are mentally ill it is a sad case in any numbers but if you add those numbers up even the most conservative version is that there were some 85 000 deaths last year related to mental illnessand it is probably much higherand more have died from mental illnessrelated problems than the total united states combat deaths of the entire korean war and vietnam wars combined that is sobering but it is worse it is worse because we could prevent a large number of these mental illness problems we could save many of those with mental illness from their early demise we could save their families from suffering but unfortunately the federal government is the problem let me lay out this evening in this special order some of the particular problems that we have in particular for those who are low income medicaid itself is one of the biggest discriminators against people with mental illness getting treatment first consider this fifteen percent of medicaid recipients have serious mental illness that is far more than the general population serious mental illness is things like schizophrenia bipolar illness schizoaffective disorder and severe depression thirtyone percent of those on ssi have serious mental illness twentysix percent of those with social security disability have serious mental illness in the general population by the way there is only about 1 percent with schizophrenia about 2 6 of the general population have been diagnosed as bipolar so look at how much higher those numbers are among the poor that makes sense because mentally ill people are three times more likely to have low income as a result of their mental illness lowincome individuals are three times more likely to have mental illness many as a result of being poor poverty and homelessness are both associated with serious mental illness both are associated with inadequate primary care and preventative care but here are some ways that medicaid makes it harder for people with mental illness to get care first of all there is a rule called the sameday doctor rule if you take someone to the doctor and the internist or family physician is very concerned that person has a mental illness they are told they have to come back another day before they can see the psychiatrist that is a serious problem because when you have the warm handoff in the doctors office you have 95 percent that will return versus less than half if they have to come back another day and treatment is the key to getting better there is a 16bed rule from the institute of mental diseases which says that if the hospital has more than 16 beds and you are between ages 22 and 64 we are not paying for it the problem with that is that serious mental illness tends to emerge in 50 percent of the cases by age 14 and in 75 percent of the cases by age 24 so at the very time when problems are emerging the very time when someone may have their first serious crisis that may require some inpatient care they are told there will be no room only 45 percent of medicaid recipients with schizophrenia actually get evidencebased care only 35 percent of those with a bipolar diagnosis who are on medicaid get evidencebased care listen to this statistic ninetytwo percent of lowincome children and foster children are prescribed drugs off labelthose are drugs that are not approved by fdaaccording to an hhs inspector generals report and many of those prescriptions according to the report are done without clinical justification the homeless with schizophrenia have a rate of hospitalization for complications of hypertension almost twice as high as others fifty percent of individuals with schizophrenia are noncompliant with treatment regimens during their illness and dont adhere to medications they need assistance in doing so also half of those with serious mental illness have at least two chronic physical health conditions such as chronic pulmonary disease infectious disease cardiovascular disease gastrointestinal problems and these people are generally in poorer health so what happens is that those with serious mental illness and a number of other clinical aspects have compromised physical symptoms and we dont have a place to treat them we used to have 550 000 psychiatric hospital beds in the 1950s now we have less than 40 000 during that same time the population of the united states climbed from 150 million to over 300 million today so where do people who have an acute mental health crisis go sadly whether it is acute or chronic about 200 000 of our homeless are mentally ill twentyeight percent of them get some of their food out of a garbage can we also have a large portion of those with mental illness filling our prisons when we closed down those psychiatric hospitals some got better but basically we traded the hospital bed for the prison cot a blanket over a subway grate an emergency room or a gurney or a slab in some morgue the incarceration rate among the seriously mentally ill is 16 percent of the population some 60 percent of the incarcerated may have some level of mental illness and then what happens in the area of violence well in general people with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population but when untreated serious mental illness occurs they are 16 times more likely to be perpetrators of violence as i said before there are over 1 000 homicides a year and we have no idea how many are victims of crime estimates are it is 6 to 10 times greater what happens if a person with mental illness is not treated the longer a person waits for treatment for a psychotic episode the longer it takes a persons illness to come into remission

gentleman from florida mr ross to clarify that private flood insurance may be an available option for homeowners to satisfy mandatory coverage requirements under the national flood insurance program for florida homeowners this is a winwin giving them more options for flood insurance coverage and using new competition to drive down prices and expand coverage options for consumers the national flood insurance program is an important tool that empowers and protects homeowners all across america the biggertwaters act of 2012 took an important step in opening up the market and allowing private flood insurance policies to satisfy mandatory coverage requirements under the program however as we have learned sometimes even the best laid plans can have unintended consequences with a lack of clarity as to which private flood insurance policies are allowed in the program the market has not been able to expand and consumers have been left with just one choice to insure their properties from flood risk the national flood insurance program i recently heard from one of my constituents in martin county florida about how the premium for just 1 year of flood insurance coverage through the nfip ended up being five times the price they expected it to be to make matters worse the maximum coverage was only half of what they paid for the home itself yet they were required to purchase the higher priced plan that did not provide the coverage they needed because there were no other options this highlights the urgent need to allow competition in the flood insurance marketplace to meet homeowners needs and drive down costs but to do that we must allow the states to license and regulate flood insurance policies exactly like homeowners insurance car insurance or health insurance yet almost inexplicably floridas private flood insurance market remains restrained because homeowners are not given the choice to look to private market policies for more flood insurance options the bank will not accept other policies because their regulators havent approved them this bill will solve this problem by allowing state insurance commissioners who have long been considered by congress as the most appropriate regulators of insurance to certify private insurance plans to provide equivalent or better protections for flood insurance other than the nfip plan everyone i talk to agrees that floridas insurance commissioner is certainly better equipped to regulate flood insurance in our state than the federal banking regulators by breaking this down we break down a major barrier to marketplace expansion this legislation will foster more competition greatly benefiting homeowners across florida and the nation i thank the gentleman from texas chairman hensarling for his leadership
