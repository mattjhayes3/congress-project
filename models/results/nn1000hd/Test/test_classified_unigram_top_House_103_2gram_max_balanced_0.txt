part of a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit the president and the democrats raise new taxes without eliminating a single federal program in the first few years of the plan the plan includes a 71billion energytax and 32 billion in taxes on senior citizens according to several studies the energy tax will cost the unitedstates economy almost 600 000 jobs by 1998 and it will lower economic growth by 35 to 50 billion the energy tax will raise the cost of practically every good and service that americans produce resulting in higher prices for consumers and making american workers and companies less competitive in the world market the average american family of four will pay an additional 500 per year in energy costs as a result of the energy tax according to a study by the american petroleum institute this is in addition to the 2 150 that the average household already pays each year in energy costs a study by the affordable energy alliance shows that a large number of the states highpaying industries mining manufacturing construction and agricultureuse a lot of energy and will be the ones hardest hit by the tax if the clinton tax had been in effect in 1990 north carolina residents and industries would have paid 714 8 million in additional energy taxes the alliance notes that a tax burden this large will slow the economy of the state cost jobs and make goods and services produced in north carolina less competitive in world markets consider for example the case of a company in my district called the timken co the timken co is a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and alloy steels if the proposed energy tax becomes effective the direct cost impact on the company resulting from higher energy needs will be 5 6 million to put that in perspective the companys net income from worldwide operations amounted to only 4 5 milion in 1992 the energy tax will cost manufacturing jobs and diminish the ability of energyintensive industries like the timken co to compete in the international market clintons plan will also raise taxes on social security recipients under current law older americans with a modest income 25 000 for singles and 32 000 for couples pay income taxes on up to 50 percent of their social security benefits but under the clinton proposal seniors will pay taxes on up to 85 percent of their benefits this increase will raise 32 billion over 5 years a study by a senior advocacy group shows that the average senior citizen will pay 483 a year in new taxes finally the presidents plan will have a devastating effect on small businesses according to information from the national federation of independent business 80 percent of businesses in america pay taxes as individuals not as corporate entities the tax code also taxes the profits of a business not what the owner takes home this means that business owners are taxed on the money they reinvest back into their business as a result the

will reflect a confluence of political will presidential vision for reform compromise by the major political parties and insistence on integrity in the electoral process by mexican voters significantly more than 90 percent of the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes which promise to change the face of the electoral process in mexico the mexicans have faced many challenges throughout this electoral reform era and campaign season not the least of which is the trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican history as our neighbors south of the border elect a new president 500 members of the chamber of deputies 96 senate seats as well as political leaders in 6 states and the federal district of mexico city because of the sweeping electoral reforms pushed by president salinas the united nations is now on the ground providing trainiing and technical assistance for domestic election observers additionally

remove the de facto regime on september 18 we had a close call an armed invasion of haiti was launched with no authority from congress and then fortunately recalled had the invasion continued it would have been a constitutional tragedy it is important that congress go on record clearly on this point the invasion the administrationstarted lacked the constitutionally required approval of congress for us now to remain silent about this would only encourage some future president again to ignore the constitutional requirement for congress to act before the country goes to war let me make it clear what my provision does not do it does not attempt to limit in any way the inherent authority of thepresident the commander in chief of our armed forces to respond as necessary to any national emergency involving an attack on or imminent danger to the citizens territory or armed forces of the united states my provision does assert the clear constitutional authority of the congress to grant its explicit prior approval before the united states launches a planned invasion of another country the records of the constitutional convention show that when the drafters vested in congress the power to declare war they meant not only a formal declaration or war but also the general category of decisions about initiating offensive military operations against another country james wilson an author of the constitution put the rationale this way it will not be in the power of a single man or a single body of men to involve us in such distress for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large the assertion of congressional authority is not some vain struggle for turf or prerogative with the executive branch the requirement for a debate and vote in congress is not an end in itself but a means to a greater end it provides an effective measure of the understanding and support of the american people for such a grave un dertaking as war the founders appreciated the need for such understanding and support and they saw the congress as the proxy of the people as best able to make the decision the last time our government faced this situation was before the persian gulf war after resisting a vote in congress for some time president bush eventually recognized that it was necessary the public debate and vote incongress worked as the founders intended when they vested the war power in congress increasing public understanding confirming public support and giving the president and our military forces the political legitimacy and moral support that was crucial to their success if on the other hand the american people through congress had registered opposition to the proposed war the country would not have been put in the dreadful position of fighting a war that did not have support at home i was pleased that president clinton was able to achieve an agreement to remove haitis military leaders without an invasion and without american bloodshed at the same time i remain deeply troubled that the president was willingup until the very moment that an agreement was signed with the de facto authorities in haitito launch an invasion without congressional approval in the case of the haiti crisis there was not even a fig leaf claim of some emergency requiring unilateral presidential action no one was claiming that we faced such a sudden threat that there was no time for congress to act and no one was claiming that there were american citizens in danger who needed to be rescued the country would not be as divided and confused as it currently is about our presence in haiti if the president had sought the congressional authority he needed for an invasion a congressional debate and a vote would have forced the president to make a clear case to the american people to support his claim that serious national interests were at stake in the haiti crisis the administration would have been forced to provide a clear plan to discuss the objectives for a military operation and eventual transfer to united nations authority in other words to make its case passage of house joint resolution 416 with the prior

to eliminate patenting altogether as h r 322 would do but rather to ensure that miners pay fairmarket value for surface rights just about everyone agrees that the industry should pay a royalty on the minerals extracted from public lands but the royalty shouldnt be set so high or imposed in such a way that is punitive or which makes it economically infeasible to mine under the royalty calculation of the bill for example not only the value of minerals would be considered but also the value added by processing after the minerals are extracted but the federal interest ends at the mouth of the mine and there is no legitimate federal claim to the value added later by processing to assert a claim to that added value is unreasonable it is unfair the bills royalty provisions also ignore the tremendous costs involved in just exploring for minerals costs incurred before even a dolws worth of return is earned such costs ought to be deductible from the royalty calculation just about everyone

would take approximately 3 billion tons of fill 2 billion and 41 years to comply with that backfilling requirement for asarcos ray mine it would take 1 4 billion tons of fill 1 4 billion and 20 years to comply for kennecotts bingham canyon mine its as much as 5 billion tone of fill 7 billion and more than 50 years to comply with the backfilling requirement that isnt reasonable it has nothing to do with significant threats to public health or the environment it is merely punitive and is just one of the ways this bill ties to discourage anyone from ever developing a mine on public land this bill is not about correcting abuses of the mining law but rather about trying to shut down virtually all mining operations on public land no matter how well those operations are conducted this bill represents an attack on jobs according to a coopers lybrand study of the original and nearly identical version of the bill as many as 44 000 jobs could be lost over the next 10 years combined with lost output and lost earnings the unitedstates treasury would experience a net lossthats right losso about 422 million over that period and at a time when state and local governments am crying out and rightly so about the costs of federal mandates h r 322 will deny them a significant amount of revenue as well an estimated 106 million with this bill congress is putting the squeeze on the states both sides of the financial balance sheet madam chairman the mining industry is not the enemy our nation needs mining and the mineral supplies it produces not only for strategic purposes but to satisfy the demands of peoples everyday lives our goal ought not to be to shut down the mining industry but rather impose reasonable requirements to protect taxpayers interests as well as the environment h r 322 is legislative overkill it will make every mining operation think twice about developing any claim no matter how promising and no matter how responsibly to the environment the operation is conducted it will cost jobs it will reduce revenues to the treasury madam chairman this bill ought to be defeated"], [0.00018858909606933594, 0.5001885890960693, 1, "the gentleman is absolutely correct on the question of rushing into this issue this is a huge trade agreement with complexities beyond our imagination we require environmental impact statements when we build a road into leary oh or require an environmental impact statement when we do almost anything in this country but we are looking to sign an agreement that will have more environmental impact than anything in this country which has been done perhaps in its history the supporters want to rush through and not do an environmental impact statement but the big issue on the timing of this is if you remember last year president bush a strong supporter of nafta his administration negotiated it president bush said they were clearly rushing to get it finalized before the 1992 election now that president clinton has taken officeyou have to say what is the hurry mr president to president bush now that president clinton has taken office he has set a selfimposed deadline by midjuly on these side agreements by the end of the year we want to make it effective by december 31 of this year you have got to say to mr clinton what is the hurry mr president in getting this negotiated common sense says if two people are negotiating something if i say to you ron klink mr klink we are negotiating this i want to finish this by tomorrow at midnight what is he going to do he is going to wait and wait and wait until i am going to cave in because i want to get it done by midnight so the president of the united states whether it is president bush or president clinton now for the president to give away to the salinas government the strategy by saying we have to have these side agreements done by july the treaty the agreement in effect by december 31 we are just simply saying to the salinas govermnent go ahead and take advantage of us nobody in labor management negotiates or acts that way as a great nation negotiating with mexico and canada we have no business acting that way either it is putting us at a distinct disadvantage you have to say what is the hurry mr kantor the trade representative what is the hurry mr president federal judge richey has moved right by saying just a little more caution give us an environmental impact statement and it will take a few months 6 8 10 months that is ok just slow down a little a lot of us in congress are saying let the mexican elections pass let the canadian elections pass let us see where we are in a few months after we have worked on the environmental impact statement take your time on this do not give your negotiating strategy away to the mexicans and the canadians move

for our country but for our trading partners around the world for america it means jobs it means competition and open markets however there is something more at stake here at the close of the cold war harry truman and republican senator arthur vandenberg joined together to formulate the marshall plan and like that historic moment in our history todays vote sets a stage and a platform for americas role in an international marketplace well into the next century this is a critical vote should we fail to pass this this week america will be in retreat if we take the reins and pass this legislation we will have every opportunity to be the leader in this new age of international competition and i urge the passage of this important treaty i am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the implementing legislation for the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatti that is before the congress this historic agreement represents over fortyfive years of trade negotiations between the united states and other member countries and the administration should be highly commended the world is continuing to evolve into a single global economy in which international trade provides the crucial link between nations as this evolution continues the internajional trading system must adapt in order to realize the maximum potential benefits worldwide and the uruguay round agreement is essential to break down existing trade barriers and thus to make these benefits a reality further the new trading rules established by the agreement will provide a more consistent and enforceable trading atmosphere as countries continue to seek competitive advantages in the global marketplace on a more regional level the passage of this legislation will add another critical building block to the goal of free trade in the western hemisphere the uruguay round agreement establishes a more stable atmosphere for continuing the work initiated by the north american free trade agreement in lowering trade barriers in central and south america more importantly for me the uruguay round is a substantial component in further opening trade opportunities for texas companies interested in accessing markets south of the border for states such as texas the uruguay round opens important foreign markets to our products being the nations third largest exporter of merchandise texas economy will be bolstered by the gatts creation of significant export and employment opportunities the timely implementation of this agreement can only be good for my states economy from 1987 to 1993 texas merchandise exports almost doubled rising by 97 percent this rise was the second largest among all the united states texas leading export industries of industrial machinery computers electronic equipment and chemical products together accounted for 57 percent of our states exports in 1993 texas is uniquely positioned to build on past successes to benefit from the uruguay round and the opportunities the gat will create in negotiating the uruguay round agreement the administration was successful in achieving unitedstates trade objectives the agreement reduces trade distortions for agricultural and industrial goods creates regulations for new areas such as services and intellectual rights and establishes an improved process for resolving trade disputes for industrial countries tariff barriers have been lowered from an average of 40 percent in the early 1950s to an average of less than 4 percent at the completion of the uruguay round specifically with respect to all signatories tariffs will be reduced on manufactured items by an average of onethird mostly by zeroing out tariffs in selected product categories for the united states and most other developed countries these categories will include steel construction and agricultural machinery furniture paper toys medical equipment and drugs as well as beer and distilled spirits industrialized countries will phase out their quotas on textiles and clothing in four stages over a 10year period for the first time however developing countries will also eliminate their textile import barriers the uruguay round agreement also effectively incorporates agriculture goods into the gatt framework agricultural tariffs will now be reduced approximately onethird over 6 years the effect will be seen in increased unitedstates agricultural exports and increased farm income further the final gatt accord will establish a new governing body for world trade the world trade organization the wto is designed to facilitate implementation of the uruguay round and more importantly to enhance the enforceability of decisions relating to international trade disputes the uruguay round agreement also includes provisions applicable to antidumping and countervailing duties these provisions are the fair result of difficult compromises between a myriad of interests in particular i would like to thank the administration for their work to improve the definition of import concentration in regional industries antidumping cases in the past interpretations of antidumping laws have made it difficult for regional industries to prevail in pursuing fair treatment as specified in the statement of administrative action the new language should provide more consistent interpretations and should more closely align future interpretations and should more closely align future interpretations with the original intent of the congress as expressed in the legislative history of the trade agreements act of 1979 i commend the administration for recognizing the unique nature of regional industries and providing regional industries with a fair remedy to respond to unfair trade practices the uruguay round agreement and the implementing legislation represents a detailed compromise between various sectors of the unitedstates economy the united states stands to realize significant benefits based on this agreement such as increased economic activity through the expansion of markets and lowering of trade barriers the agreement will provide stimulus for job creation at home as well as improved welfare worldwide we must seize the opportunity to pass the implementing legislation at the earliest possible time so that other countries will follow our lead and the benefits of the agreement can be fully realized to further illustrate the importance of gatt i would like to bring your attention to a recent editorial by former president gerald r ford and i include the follow by gerald r ford next week congress will return to washingthn to vote on the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs a~nd trade this is the most important vote of the 103rd congress for it is about fundamental issues the nation we are and the nation we aspire to be senators and congressmen should bear in mind that our nations economic healthnow and in the futureis inextricably linked to the outside world sixty percent of the wheat we grow half of the computers and aircraft and over a third of the machine tools semiconductors and construction machinery we produce each year are shipped to overseas markets this agreement makes us a lot more competitive it dramatically cuts the taxes that other nations impose on the products we ship for example it cuts japans koreas and indias tariffs by more than half europe our single biggest market will reduce its tariffs by 37 without the uruguay rounds sweeping changes we condemn ourselves to a lawless international jungle where trade conflicts multiply for an increasing share of what we sell abroad is not covered by internationally agreedupon trade rules for example there are no rules covering trade in agriculture nations are free to subsidize their producers and thereby price unitedstates farmers out of world markets nor are there any rules covering services nations are free to bar our companiesfrom providing accounting telecommunications health care or engineering services in their markets and there are no rules to prevent foreign pirates from copying software books cds and recordings from american producers such theft amounts to 60 billion a year this agreement changes all that as the worlds largest exporter of goods and services the unitedstates is the largest beneficiary of this agreement and it would be the largest loser from its defeat our legislators have hard perhaps disproportionately from those who are concerned that the agreement will break the budget but the truth is quite different reliable economic studies show that the agreement will boost unitedstates economic growth by 100 billion to 200 billion a year and thus generate about three times more in tax revenues than we lose in tariffs our legislators have also heard from some who assert that the proposed world trade organization creates a form of world government that will run roughshod over unitedstates sovereignty but this vote does not affect unitedstates sovereignty nothing in the agreement changes unitedstates laws or standards only congress can change our laws this vote isas much about our continued role as global leader as it is about our economic prosperity for nearly 50 years we have led the world in dismantling barriers to commerce among nations we have helped to fashion a world in which nations are bound together by trade and investmentwhich discourages international conflict and encourages collaboration our nation has stood as a role model for so many nations encouraging them to make the tough transition from statecontrolled to marketdriven economies persuading them to enter the world community and end their selfimposed isolation although 10 presidents have occupied the white house since world war ii there has been one constant regardless of party affiliation each has encouraged trade liberalization for five decades we have enjoyed bipartisan support for a policy that opens markets and expands trade i stood with president carter bush and clinton a year ago at the white house to lend my support to the north american free trade agreement the gatt negotiations were launched under president reagan all but brought to a close under president bush and finally concluded under president clinton this agreement deserves bipartisan support as legislators prepare for this vote they should reflect on the fact that we are the leader in an increasingly integrated world the forces driving such integration are many technology and communications airplanes and fax machines we cannot stop this process lets not make the mistake of 1931when congress approved smoothawley the protectionist hightariff legislation that deepened and accelerated the great depression we must participate in the adoption of international principles that will move us forward minimize potential areas of disagreement and resolve conflicts when they occur this is a vote about the future and what our role in it will be a vote in favor of the agreement is a vote for prosperity not poverty for order not chaos the vote should not even be close"], [0.0005053877830505371, 0.5005053877830505, 0, "i yield myself the remainder of my time the speaker just a short time ago used the term cynicism the american people are very cynical about what is going on i would ask my colleagues and as a matter of fact members of the press and everybody at home to take out your campaign reform checklist let us look at what is actually in these two bills first of all you just heard it once again from the majority leader this bill before us today does nothing and it will do nothing until democrats vote a revenue package to make it work if they vote a revenue package all of the good stuff they have talked about is on the shelf until they put money in this bill now ask yourself why would a member of congress who is an incumbent with hundreds of thousands of dollars in his or her campaign war chest give a political contribution to another incumbent who has a war chest of hundreds of thousands of dollars would you not think it is because the incumbent is trying to influence the other incumbent why would a member of congress want to influence another member of congress because we play games inside this body such as who sits on which subcommittee who gets to be a member and who gets to be the chairman of a particular subcommittee those insidious devices to pay off people inside this system are called leadership pacs the republican substitute bans leadership pacs the democrats proposal does not the gentleman from washington talked about bagmen with money about money under the table that is why it was in the 1960s and the early 1970s all of this reform such as the political action committee movement was designed to get corporate money out of the system socalled soft money because under federal contribution laws you cannot give corporate money but we still have corporate money in the system today the michel substitute bans soft money theirs does not it allows soft money to stay in the system we ban the bundling of contributions we think it is wrong they ban the bundling of contributions except for those groups that are politically correct we say that if an incumbent has hundreds of thousands of dollars that he or she carries over in a massive campaign war chest why not let a political party match that incumbents amount and give the challenger the same amount that the incumbent carries over if the incumbent does not want the challenger to have a lot of money do not carry it over it is an automatic fix on the problem of an incumbents war chest we propose thatsolution in our substitute they do not we looked at the idea of the senate democrats and the senate republicans that they put in their campaign package the banning of political action committees and if that ban is unconstitutional limiting them to 1 000 we decided that was a good idea we have it in our package the house democrats do not the democrats on the floor of the house are standing in the way of fundamental political action committee reform i personally believe that the supreme court would uphold the constitutional right of political action committees to freely and voluntarily organize but i see no constitutional guarantee that political action committees get to put more money in the system than anybody else there is nothing wrong with a 1 000 limit on political action committees finally democrats say they limit campaigns and they have a mechanism for limiting the dollars yes but only if they spend only if they go ahead and vote the revenue do they then have a 1 million limit you know i heard the majorityleader say that that is the heart of campaign reform let me tell you what the heart of campaign reform is going to be we have read about political consultants in the news recently what we have seen is that they take these megabuck campaigns and play games with each other let me ask you what is the system that has a better chance of games being played a system which allows you to raise a million dollars of which you do not have to raise a penny from people in your district or a system where every time you want an outside dollar you have got to go to people who are actually in the district and ask them for a contribution do you think the political shenanigans that go on in campaigns now negative campaigning the mudslinging and all the rest would go on if you had to go to your constituents and say i need your contribution before i can take another contribution the reason so much negative campaigning goes on is because candidates import the money they get it from other places threequarters of the american people agree with us they want to require candidates to get money from their district money is the means not the end it is votes the votes of individuals are the end in this process why do we not reunite the voting precinct with the financial precinct why do we not tell candidates in this country today you should go to the people who can vote in the election to determine how much money is spent in the campaign not some arbitrary number dictated by incumbents to guarantee that they still have got those war chests to carry on the negative campaigns bring financing back home you will limit the spending but more importantly you will clean up the sewer kind of campaigns that now go on the michel substitute is real fundamental reform across the board and i urge its support"], [0.0005109906196594238, 0.4994890093803406, 0, "i ask the members to listen very carefully because i think the gentleman is misinterpreting the amendment the gentlemans point of order is incorrect because it relies on an incorrect reading of the language of the

the point of order is based on reducing the words and phrases to the point that they are susceptible of any meaning this i would note is not strict constructionism where we confine our interpretation to the text but rather an extreme form of deconstructionism the pertinent part of my amendment encourages the states to consider granting certain protections to volunteers whose function and duties are directly connected to the administration of a program described in section 122 a of h r 2010 this language references back to the entire section 122 a not just to a part of it as the gentleman

through subgants to other entities to carry out full or parttime national service programs including summer programs that address unmet human educational environmental or public safety needs subject to the section b i these national service programs may include the following types of national service programs and then the section discusses these types of programs this is what section 122 a describes it describes a recipient carrying out a program with public support and then lists the types of programs that may be funded read fully as it should be section 122 b describes programs receiving funding under the act funding under the act recipients of a grant and i am quoting now recipients of a grant under section 121 a that is funding under the act the section does not describe a hypothetical unfunded program but rather recipients of the assistance and what they may use it for what the gentleman is attempting to do is to read into my amendment words which do not exist his claim is essentially that my amendment includes the words of the type described when in fact it does not if my amendment did include those words i would concede that it references the latter portion

position on this issue and that is what i explained last night i think this is the only issue where i differ with the gentleman from new york and i was on his side last year and the year before that and the 4 years before that and the reason i have changed is i have been to china and i have seen the boat that we are about to miss in kwangtung province in the southern province 7 000 factories where a few years ago there was none and i looked around and i saw how are they supplying these factories and those are coming from oklahoma from new york and from the united states and it is a
