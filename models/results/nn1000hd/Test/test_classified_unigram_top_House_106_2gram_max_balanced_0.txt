ask my colleagues to accept it my district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social

inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am

on resources and based on an understanding and agreement that we have reached i will be asking for unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment let me first say that the cara bill that is before us today and tomorrow is extremely important for the conservation future of our nation for this reason i am a strong supporter of the bill and voted for its passage as a member of the committee on resources cara is a remarkable bill that will dramatically increase environmental and conservation efforts in all 50 states the amendment that i am offering tonight addresses a very pressing conservation need regarding the upper mississippi river basin the upper mississippi river basin is one of our nations great ecological and recreational treasures its rich wetlands and back woods serve as north americas largest migratory route the region boasts tremendous diversity in animal and plant species income from fishing hunting boating and other recreational activities total roughly 1 2 billion annually and the areas tourist industries much of which are centered on the river contribute 6 6 billion to the regions economy it is also the primary drinking source for 22 million americans and the upper mississippi river refuge has more visitors every year than yellowstone national park unfortunately increasing soil erosion threatens this region and the wildlife habitat for instance soil erosion reduces the longterm sustainability and income of family farms and sediment is entering the river basin and costing the american taxpayers roughly 100 million each year in dredging costs alone one of the best ways to reduce sediment and nutrient losses from the landscape is to protect sensitive riparian areas through voluntary program for land purchases conservation easements and the implementation of best management practices all fundamental components of the cara bill my amendment seeks to assist conservation planning in the region through the development of a scientific sediment and nutrient monitoring network the goal of the network is to enable states and other governmental and nongovernmental entities to make better decisions about where to direct resources and to determine which conservation measures are most appropriate in the mississippi river basin the amendment i am proposing tonight is but a single component of a far larger basin initiative that i introduced earlier this year h r 4013 the upper mississippi river basin conservation act we have over 18 cosponsors from eight states h r 4013 establishes the monitoring network contained in my amendment here tonight as well as a stateoftheart computer modeling program to identify significant sources of sediments and nutrients it provides grants and incentives to states and counties to implement best management practices and other innovative voluntary programs it calls for increases in the usda highly effective but underfunded land conservation programs finally it contains data protection provisions designed to protect the privacy of individual landowners in the basin which i know is very important to a lot of property rights advocates in this body the legislation relies entirely on voluntary programs and creates no new regulations i believe this approach to watershed management is the wave of the future it is proactive rather than reactive seeking to stop harmful nutrients and sediments before they make it into the river basin rather than relying on expensive cleanup and mitigation efforts after the fact the approach is basin wide rather than piecemeal seeking to look at the entire ecosystem and develop management plans appropriate to a largescale physical system finally this approach relies on interagency and intergovernmental cooperation attempting to coordinate the diverse but sometimes fragmented conservation efforts of federal state and local agencies as well as nongovernmental organizations i urge support of h r 4013 and invite my colleagues to

went with a few of us to talk to both sides and we spent considerable time with mr arafat discussing this issue earlier this year i had the privilege of addressing the palestinian national council along with former prime minister peres and the former head of the soviet union mikhail gorbachev my message on all three occasions was very simple a unilateral declaration of statehood by arafat would permanently destroy the peace process let me repeat that if arafat goes ahead with a unilateral declaration of statehood whether it is on may 4 or may 25 or july 11 the peace process is over let me say to some of my colleagues some on my side of the aisle who are straining for equivalence the equivalence would be to call on israel not to unilaterally declare statehood israel has been a state for over 50 years an ally of the united states a member of the united nations with diplomatic representation all over the world there is no equivalence here because the two sides are not equivalent we are talking about a unique historic situation whereby a sovereign and independent state is in the process of voluntarily negotiating the surrender of territories it occupies and possibly negotiating the creation by mutual consent of another state now some have belittled this resolution as being not binding well it may not be binding but it surely has consequences let me state here and now so that

palestinian authority instantaneously so this is not an academic debate should it be necessary to introduce such legislation it will pass overwhelmingly some think that since there have been technical

having amendments all over the place i would love to have floor time and have a 3day debate it is going to be a 3day debate at least it has been a bipartisan proposal all the way and i would hope we would get something done where it could be pulled together and we might look at it as a base bill which does not preclude the gentleman from massachusetts"], [0.0001323223114013672,

alabama our distinguished chairman has been most cooperative on this issue of tibet it is a priority for many of us on the committee and of course the gentleman from new york chairman of the authorizing committee has been a champion on the tibet issue for a long time but as the gentleman from alabama said the funds are in the bill already because this is a priority the plight of the people of tibet challenges the conscience of the world and by and large the world ignores their plight our bill does not and the more attention we can call the better even though this may not be able to be received by the full house this evening nonetheless the bright light that the gentlewoman focuses on tibet once again is appreciated and will contribute to freedom there one day"],

the ranking member for yielding this time to me i would like to respond to the gentleman from indiana very briefly regarding the question he raised about how we are providing for a stable europe by the actions that have been undertaken last week i traveled with the gentleman from new york to the oxford forum in belfast ireland while there our interlocutors were parliamentary officials from germany and from england we left there and went to london and met with robin cook all along the way including with the prime minister of ireland all we heard was praise for the overall aspect of this particular operation and how it has unified the alliance in the new paradigm i think we really need to examine it from that point of view but i do rise in opposition to the amendment from my friend from indiana it is unfathomable to me that as a peace agreement has just been signed and we are about to achieve our goals for ending the ethnic cleansing in kosovo that some members of this great institution are attempting to prevent the united states from participating in an international security force quite frankly i am not only shocked i am outraged at the lengths to which critics of our commander in chief will go to embarrass him rather than at this time celebrate a triumph and applaud our military for having achieved a successful operation we are about the business of continuing to try to hamper the efforts that are put forward for peace first these persons tried to prevent the commander in chief from stopping genocide in europe now they are trying to stop him from securing

authorization this conference report is important because it focuses on providing our soldiers sailors airmen and marines the equipment and other resources necessary to accomplish the vital mission of protecting this nations vital interests there has been considerable debate during this election year about the status of our militarys readiness this discussion often focuses on a range of topics including pay facilities new equipment size of the force and procurement well im proudto stand before you and tell you that this report does more than debate pontificate or raise additional discussion items this report funds and places resources where the service chiefs feel they are needed and in a number of cases provides additional funding to address the service chiefs unfunded requirements for their procurement readiness and modernization efforts it is also important to acknowledge that this conference report also addresses a number of quality of life issues for our military personnel there are a number of important initiatives included in this report some may see these initiatives as an increase in benefits however things like increased minimumhousing allowances for young families and a 3 7 pay raise and a comprehensive set of improvements to the military health care system are not perks or increased benefits they are simply the least we can do for those service members and their families who sacrifice every day beyond all of the campaign rhetoric and posturing this report demonstrates congress commitment our commitment to our nations military and the men and women who serve in that military i urge all of my colleagues to support this conference report"], [0.00037550926208496094, 0.500375509262085, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i might add quickly here
