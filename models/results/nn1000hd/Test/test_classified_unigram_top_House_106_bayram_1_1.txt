many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled

suburbs and cook and will counties a lot of industrial as well as farm communities and even though this district that i represent is so very very diverse i find there is a common message and that is the folks back home want us to come here republicans and democrats and work together to find solutions to the challenges that we face that is why i am so proud that over the last 5 years we have done so many things we were told we could not do we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years we gave a middleclass tax cut for the first time in 16 years we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation and a great accomplishment just this past year was we stopped the raid on social security for the first time in 30 years that is progress on our agenda and we are continuing to move forward to find better ways to help find solutions our agenda is pretty simple paying down the public national debt saving social security and medicare helping our local schools and we also want to bring fairness to the tax code that is one of the issues i want to talk about today because i believe that as we work to bring fairness to the tax code particularly to middleclass working families that we should focus first on the most unfair consequence of our current complicated tax code and that is the marriage tax penalty which is suffered by almost 21 million married working couples let me explain what the marriage tax penalty is under our current tax code if they are married both husband and wife are working they pay more in taxes than they do if they stay single let me give this example a marriage tax penalty example a machinist and a schoolteacher middleclass working folks in joliet illinois with a combined income of 63 000 paymore and here is how they do it if they have a machinist making 31 500 he is in the 15 percent tax bracket if he marries a schoolteacher with an identical income of 31 500 under our tax code they file jointly their combined income of 63 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and for this machinist and schoolteacher they pay the average marriage tax penalty of almost 1 400 more just because they are married under our tax code now if they chose to live together instead of getting married they would have saved that 1 400 our tax code punishes them if they choose to get married that is just wrong it is a pretty fair question is it right is it fair that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher in joliet illinois pay more in higher taxes let me give my colleagues another example here of two schoolteachers also of joliet illinois michelle and shad hallihan they were just married in the last couple of years a wonderful young couple i have had a chance to sit down and talk with them and of course i have a nice wedding photo the point is that shad has taught a little longer than michelle and he makes 38 000 a year his wife michelle makes 23 500 because they chose to get married to live together in holy matrimony they suffer the marriage tax penalty because their combined income when they file jointly pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket for them for michelle and shad hallihan in joliet illinois two schoolteachers they pay almost a thousand dollars more michelle has pointed out to me since they have just had a baby that is almost 3 000 diapers that 1 000 of marriage tax penalty would pay for in that family if they were allowed to keep it now the republicans in this congress believe that eliminating the marriage tax penalty should be a priority and we believe that in this era of budget surpluses when the federal government is taking in more than we have been spending that we should give some of it back we want to focus that on bringing fairness to the tax code this past year we sent to the president legislation that would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for people like michelle and shad hallihan unfortunately the president and vice president gore chose to veto that legislation because they wanted to spend the money on new government programs my colleagues should it not be a priority to help people like michelle and shad hallihan married working couples who work hard and who are unfairly treated by our tax code we have legislation today which now has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house that is cosponsoring the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 cosponsored by myself and the gentleman from missouri and the gentleman from indiana as well as 230 members of the house that is why it is so important we want to bring fairness to the tax code that is why i am so pleased that the leadership of this house led by the gentleman from illinois the speaker of the house has made a decision to move a standalone piece of legislation a standalone bill which wipes out the marriage tax penalty for the vast majority of those who suffer in the next few weeks the speaker intends to bring that legislation to the floor that is good news as we work to bring fairness to the tax code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty i was just informed earlier today that the president in his state of the union speech tonight is going to discuss eliminating the marriage tax penalty that is good news because it is time to make it a bipartisan effort and while the president and vice president gore vetoed the legislation last year he is now coming our way i am very pleased let us make it a bipartisan effort let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty and let us send the president a standalone bill and let us bring fairness to the tax

support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is

in the allocation of the fossil research money is to ensure we get the best possible use of the resources this is an interesting statistic onethird of the worlds population 2 billion people do not even have access to electricity of course that again is going to cause a tripling of consumption over the next 50 years as the lesser developed nations try to expand their economy it is a market for

gas to be more efficient that is part of the fossil research we can get gas from deeper and more complex formations we can get a better extraction because we need all these energy sources we need coal

testing on animals and it will require federal agencies to consider the iccvams recommendations on alternative test methods more importantly h r 4281 eliminates the incentive for industries to prefer status quo animal tests by giving the iccvam the authority to make an otherwise fragmented regulatory process coherent cost effective and more readily accessible the adoption of h r 4281 will demonstrate a commitment to increasing the alof health and environmental safety of all americans by simplifying the process by which industries implement more technologically advanced methods of research into their product safety testing protocols we must ensure that as we enter the 21st century the federal govemnment is working efficiently to incorporate scientific progress into product safety tests and not solely relying on antiquated and inhumane animal tests to safeguard human health with this in mind i strongly urge my colleagues to join me by supporting h r"],

that is being rescinded might be needed in order to maintain agricultural markets it is precisely that reason that just in case we find this year that that capital will be needed i want it to be available and i think it makes much more sense for this body to have that capital available in case agriculture or any other producers of anything in the united states might benefit by whoever might use that capital that it might be available and we are kind of into the nevernever land here because if this really was emergency spending this debate would not even be taking place here today i happen to believe it is emergency but i happen to believe at this stage in the budget debate that we need to pay for all expenditures even emergency spending and that is why i am here striking emergency the president asked this be emergency and not be offset some folks on both sides of the aisle believe it ought to be offset i believe that unless we strike the particular offsets and do an acrosstheboard cut we are playing with fire that will far more damage agriculture this year than any of the problems associated with the amendment that i offer in striking the funds for salaries etcetera at this time that is the record and i could not agree more with the chairman a moment ago in his explanation of what he is doing and why be cause he and i agree on this but this does not take congress off the hook my amendment puts congress on the hook because my colleague and i both know that if we have acrosstheboard cuts some things are going to be very meaningful some areas of the budget will have much more meaningful cuts than others because some are tighter than others so i do not say i am trying to take anybody off the hook i am saying i am willing to put us on the hook and i think acrosstheboard cuts are much more doable i do not want to use the word honest i just believe that they put congress in a more responsible way of saying yes we want to pay for we want to live within the caps and we mean it and i thanked the chairman a moment ago for agreeing that that is his interpretation of what i am trying to do we have a difference on this but to those who argue that this capital unexpended is not going to have any effect on kansas wheat farmers this summer be careful be careful when they make that argument in case they win because if the economy of the world should turn around and go even worse mr greenspan in what he has warned us and let me just quote the disappointing export developments and pressures on farm prices over the past few quarters can be traced to an important degree to the recession that began in asia more than a year and a half ago and has since spread to other regions of the world falling shipments to asian countries accounted for more than 80 percent in the drop of value of farm exports over the past 2 years let us be careful what we do today there are real prices to be paid if we are in error i believe an acrosstheboard cut would be much sounder for national policy and agriculture policy than what is being suggested by the majority bill"], [0.0014905333518981934, 0.4985094666481018, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume as i indicated earlier in summary the bill restores all safety enforcement powers to the department where they will be administered by the office of the secretary for fiscal year 2000 only so that safety is not reduced while congress considers comprehensive motor carrier safety legislation i would just like to read if i could briefly from a letter from our united states secretary of transportation rodney slater that is dated today i am writing to urge congress to act quickly on legislation to restore enforcement authorities underlying our motor carrier safety programs that were suspended october 9 as a result of enactment of h r 2084 the department of transportation appropriations act the need to act is cleai we currently have 922 cases pending involving a total of 6 million in outstanding civil claims our work with the departments inspector general and the unitedstates attorneys office is in abeyance and the exercise of some other authorities is now subject to question i submit the copy of his full letter for the record this is in response to a clear need outlined by the secretary of transportation i urge speedy passage of this legislation"]]}
