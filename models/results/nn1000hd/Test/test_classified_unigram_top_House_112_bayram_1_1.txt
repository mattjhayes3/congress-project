cosponsored restores accountability to the regulatory process by requiring an upordown vote in congress and the presidents signature on any new major rule before it is enforced on the american people

however will cost the economy more than 1 billion each at the current pace the current regulatory burden for 2011 alone will exceed 105 billion and the federal government has created more than 81 9 million hours worth of paperwork this year alone costing employers 80 billion just in compliance its no wonder a recent gallup poll found small business owners citing complying with government regulations as the most important problem they face nebraskans have not been immune to the reams of red tape being handed down by federal regulators just yesterday it was reported the city of grand island nebraska population 51 000 will be saddled with a 3 2 million compliance cost due to a new federal emissions regulation this epa crossstate air pollution rule was finalized june 1 and will be enforced but this is only one example there are additional even more costly rules and unworkable timelines coming down the pike all of which mean a much longer winter for americans struggling with high energy costs but it doesnt stop there recently the department of labor proposed a misguided rule which would restrict youth involvement in agriculture work yes anything from milking cows and feeding calves to hauling and detassling corn would come under fire under the departments current rule everyone agrees the safety of these young people and workers everywhere is of the utmost importance but by allowing such heavyhanded thoughtless regulation were greatly restricting opportunities for rural youth these jobs often seasonal teach young people responsibility and the value of hard work and theyre able to earn a little spending money in the process im also a proud cosponsor of the farm dust regulation prevention act of 2011 h r 1633 which the house is slated to consider later this week this bill would prevent the epa from regulating farm dust or the type of dust which naturally occurs in rural areas farmers and ranchers already are subject to strict federal and state regulations to control dust it makes no sense for the epa to impose costlier requirements on top of the existing standards while the epa has backed off without legislative action nothing certainly prohibits the agency from regulating farm dust in the future during a time of economic hardship keeping the door open for additional regulatory overreach is not the answer actually im often reminded of a meeting i had in southeastern nebraska with representatives from a federal agency good people they are one of them said it had been more than 20 years since hed ridden on a gravel road for me this meeting certainly emphasized the disconnect between washington and rural america these are only a few examples of the regulatory burden and uncertainty facing nebraskans who recognize economic growth ultimately depends on job creators not regulators i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support commonsense regulatory reforms like the reins act this is yet another step towards increased accountability improving the regulatory process and providing certainty for job creators in my home state of nebraska and in states all across this country"], [0.04273098707199097,

since the republican caucus has taken over the majority they havent put one jobs bill on i mean they havent done a poor jobthey havent done anything it is as if they are not in favor of americans having jobs we know they are but they havent demonstrated it in anything they have done which is the important thing instead as part of the republican no jobs agenda they bring up a bill to cut 1 million jobs cut 1 million jobs from the american middle class these cuts are republican answers for the job crisis that they created cutting 1 million jobs if you are a nurse no jobs if you are a teacher no jobs if you are a firefighter or police officer no jobs if your jobs are from american manufacturing no jobs and if you are a small business person who is going to have any money to even go into your store no jobs for them either the list goes on and on if you want to know how we cut the deficit it is by putting america to work not by cutting social security make no mistake when the republicans say they are cutting costs they are cutting social security they are cutting medicare they are cutting medicaid until they cease to exist republicans want working americans to shoulder the whole burden the burden of a taxpayerfunded spending spree for the rich while protecting millionaires and billionaires who refuse to pay their fair share the republican answer to the crisis they created is you pay american people they must make you pay for big oils billion dollar subsidies they want to make you pay for higher drug prices they want to make you pay for taxes to start a small business they want to make you pay for ceo bonuses they want main street to take the hit while wall street gets a bonus while democrats work to create jobs reduce the deficit and rebuild america

out for constituents first not corporate friends and now the american people are saying show us the jobs we have been seeing a no jobs agenda a jobless agenda forty days in the majority and nothing to create jobs no jobs for the american people madam chairman we need to make this change will the republican caucus even today madam chairman say you know what we are not going to cut 1 million people 1 million public employees out of work we are going to actually do something to create jobs it appears not madam chairman what we need to do is withdraw some of these massive oil subsidies what we need to do is save some money by not rewarding the wealthiest among us and industries who have not been responsible corporate citizens and actually use it to put americans back to work so that they can pay some taxes and actually reduce this deficit make no mistake about it madam chairman we are concerned about the deficit 200 billion of it goes to interest on the debt that money could be going to programs that help people to help children to help seniors that can make and strengthen and improve our infrastructure and our country but instead it goes to this massive debt built up by republicans with their massive tax cuts to the rich two wars and a big pharma giveaway they created the problem now when we try to solve it they want to put us back in the hole so i want to say that if this

bill to pass this congress and as youve heard from my colleagues we need to begin with the american jobs act which was proposed by our president barack obama and just to be clear while were advocates for the african american community we are advocates for everyone and this bill is good for everyone everyone who lives in this country and it is a good bill for our country we happen to feel that putting people back to work in this country now is more important than fighting over an election that is more than a year away the american jobs act provides tax cuts that will help businesses grow and create jobs it will help provide incentives to hire the longterm unemployed and it will keep teachers and other essential workers like police and firefighters in their jobs where we need them to be and it will strengthen repair and build needed and faulty infrastructure and in doing so will create even more jobs and it will give people a decent job which will allow them to take care of their families to buy what we make here in america and it will stimulate economic growth it would give every american worker and their family a tax cut through extending the tax payroll tax holiday and do more to fix the mortgage crisis that got us here in the first place by allowing more refinancing of mortgages it would help our fellow americans take better care of their families putting their children in better schools supporting small businesses building consumer confidence and spurring the spending that our economy needs to get back on track this is what this congress ought to be doing not focusing on the solitary goal of making president obama a oneterm president that is a losing proposition anyway no one should be willing to let our fellow americans suffer fall into and become mired in poverty remain unemployed lose homes and to cause our economy to crumble further just because they have political and whatever other differences with our president the republican leadership led by the tea party extremists are taking this country in the absolute wrong direction by insisting on cutting and cutting and cutting important programs and services like the women infants and children program maternal and child health and supplemental nutrition assistance programs at a time when there are more people and more children in poverty by working to deny the opportunity for health care to the over 30 million people who we worked so hard to get insured including sick children and people who would otherwise go bankrupt because of catastrophic illnesses over which they had no control people who are already getting care because of the affordable care act that is being so wrongly maligned i agree with some of the posters i saw in the newspaper this weekend calling for jobs not cuts jobs not cuts that is what we have been saying all year including here on the floor of the house every monday that weve been in session if our leadership listened instead of talk talk talk i believe that is what they will hear the american people at large are saying jobs not cuts and we have a golden opportunity to listen to them for over the last 2 weeks there has been an occupation of wall street because while homeowners and pensioners and many people have suffered because of their meltdown we have not seen the kind of remedies for the folks on main street the side streets or the rural roads that would make them whole they are speaking loudly and effectively on their and on our behalf and then right here in washington d c today and for the next 3 days the take back the american dream conference is here they will be on the hill on wednesday calling on us to end the nightmare that the dream is turning into for far too many people and to restore the american dream access which has been the hallmark and the pride of this country what is happening at this conference and the one in new york is that americans are saying enough is enough and they are fighting back against the cuts that are making it hard for far too many people in this country to survive theyre fighting back against attempts to repeal health care reform fighting back against proposals that would weaken social security medicare and medicaid and fighting back against voter suppression laws theyre fighting for jobs for a future for our children and theyre fighting for our democracy it is so very interesting this talk about president obama and democrats waging class warfare all because we want everyone in this country to do their part to help this country recover from a deep recession all because we want to let tax cuts that were only supposed to be around for 10 years that have now been extended to 12 years finally expire like they were supposed to come on colleagues lets be honest they were never meant to be permanent and how many jobs have these tax cuts created as was loudly touted they would do in 2001 at the end of the clinton administration he handed over this government with an over 2 trillion surplus now after those tax cuts enacted in 2001 after almost 12 years of them we are in record deficits and the worst recession since the great depression and president obama did not create that he inherited it the poverty rate is at the second highest in 45 years and it is hitting as youve heard african americans and latino americans hardest the share of americans in deep poverty with incomes below half of the poverty line is at the highest level ever recorded and african americans are more likely to be in extreme poverty while we hear a lot about how much of a share of taxes the richest 1 percent or the richest 10 percent pay let me remind everyone that white americans wealth is 20 timesand you heard it earlier but it bears repeating20 times that of african americans and 18 times that of latinos and that between 2000 and 2007 not 10 percent not 20 percent not 40 percent but 100 percent all of the increase in wealth went to the top 10 percent in this countryall the top 10 percent the gap between rich and poor got wider the rich got richer the poor got poorer thats a very dangerous trend for the future of this country and then unemployment has reached record highs as well you dont hear about it much you hear it from us but in far too many places our rural and our urban areas communities of color unemployment remains in double digits african american unemployment nationally is over 16 percent but as youve heard we know that it is higher than that in many parts of our country so if we want to talk honestly about class warfare class warfare is what too many people in this country have been experiencing since 2001 and now that we have a president who wants to end it he is being accused of class warfare if we really want to end class warfare my colleagues my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should be supporting rather than opposing him lets get real in all of our 40 years the congressional black caucus has always been a caucus of action our agenda has been consistent and weve pushed every congress and every president and so we resent anyone trying to put a wedge between us and our president to further their own agenda one which is clearly not ours but we continue to be the conscience of the congress as maxine waters coined when she was chair the fairness cops of our nation that is why when we could see none of our 40 jobcreating bills come to the floor under the leadership of our chairman emanuel cleaver and the jobs task force chair and former cbc chair maxine waters we called on the private sector as well as government agencies to come with us across the country to get people working again and that is why we worked so hard with our hispanic and asian colleagues to get the affordable care act passed and we will work just as hard to see that it gets implemented we are not going to sit quietly and let a vital door that is just opening for many to be slammed shut in our communities and communities like ours who need it most many scholarly reports have shown that just eliminating health disparities could save 1 24 trillion in just over 4 years in indirect and direct costs in addition to saving lives so if we really wanted a deficit reduction eliminating health disparities and achieving health equity is deficit reduction at its best and thats why we will continue to work relentlessly as a caucus to save homes to build and equip better schools to support regulations that protect our families and all families from the health and other effects of pollution we have also worked together on budgets and because we know that our country can invest where needed in health care education green energy and job creation and reduce the deficit at the same time we are preparing to send our recommendation to the joint select committee on deficit reduction it will likely be based on our proposed 2012 budget and it will end class warfare by allowing the highend bush tax cuts to expire while strengthening the middle class continuing to create pathways out of poverty for our fellow americans and protecting social security medicare and medicaid this country is fortunate to have

it saved a little bit of money and then we ended up spending 10 times as much money bailing people out when it collapsed so you have got to be careful what you are doing but the problem here is were arguing about something that no longer exists this program that they sued us under no longer exists we have fixed it two or three times we tried to address this it was never good enough for the brazilians but we made some changes and we made some more changes and then we made some more changes in the 2008 farm bill its still not good enough for them cotton went through some very difficult times i dont have any cotton in my district this is not a parochial issue for me but if they wouldnt have had that safety net we would have been out of the cotton business but what was going on at the same time we had brazil using government money to increase cotton production in brazil and this is something that isnt considered in the wto because we are such geniuses that we agreed to this agreement that tied our hands and gave our competitors the ability to eat our lunch and thats whats going on you know jbs which just took over a big part of the livestock industry in this country is financed by the brazilian government they own 30 percent of jbs nobody complains about that the brazilian government created most of this competition that collapsed the cotton prices worldwide and then we agreed to let china into the wto and they promised that they werent going to go into cotton production we shipped our textile market to china and collapsed all of our textile industry and what happened they increased production like crazy india increased production like crazy our cotton prices went down below the cost of production because of these trade agreements that we got involved in but the way theyre structured theres nothing we can do about it but theyre going to sue us over a little step two program that we now got rid of trying to keep our people in business now if you want to ship the whole cotton industry to brazil and china and india you are on a good start to doing that and if you keep on this road youre going to ship the rest of agriculture to these socalled developing nations that are not developing nations if youve been to brazil in agriculture they are anything but a developing nation but theyre protected under the rules that we agreed to in this wto

how the bomb was triggered how the bomb was triggered a substantive discussion of the myriad negative impacts of the technology that came out of the manhattan project is relegated to obscurity a public forum tucked away in a corner provides space for public input when the unitedstates dropped atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in august of 1945 more than 200 000 people were killed instantly in the years that followed over 100 000 additional people died of radiation poisoning the japanese people today continue to experience the devastating and longterm effects of the bomb it is now widely acknowledged by many top unitedstates government officials at the time of the war that dropping the bomb on japan was completely unnecessary i want to get into that section at this moment so that those who say well we need to create a memorial to the bomb because it ended the war well thats not true im going to give you some quotes this is from dwight david eisenhower who was general of the armies and also later on president of the united states he said in july 1945 secretary of war stimson visiting my headquarters in germany informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on japan i was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act the secretary upon giving me the news of the successful bomb test in new mexico and of the plan for using it asked for my reaction apparently expecting a vigorous assent during his recitation of the relevant facts i had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so i voiced to him my grave misgivings first on the basis of my belief that japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary and secondly because i thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was i thought no longer mandatory as a measure to save american lives it was my belief that japan was at that very moment seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of face the secretary was deeply perturbed by my attitude thats dwight eisenhower in a book called mandate for change page 360 from general douglas macarthur norman cousins was a consultant to general macarthur during the american occupation of japan cousins writes of his conversations with macarthur macarthurs views about the decision to drop the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki were starkly different from what the general public supposed cousins continues when i asked general macarthur about the decision to drop the bomb i was surprised to learn he had not even been consulted what i asked would his advice have been he replied that he saw no military justification for the dropping of the bomb the war might have ended weeks earlier he said if the united states had agreed as it later did anyway to the retention of the institution of the emperor thats from a book called the pathology of power norman cousins leo szilard was the first scientist to conceive of how an atomic bomb might be made that was in 1933 he speaks of a meeting with j robert oppenheimer the head scientist of the manhattan project szilard i told oppenheimer that i thought it would be a very serious mistake to use the bomb against the cities of japan oppenheimer didnt share my views well said oppenheimer dont you think that if we tell the russians what we intend to do and then use the bomb in japan the russians will understand it theyll understand it only too well szilard replied brigadier general carter clarke who was the military intelligence officer in charge of preparing intercepted japanese cables we didnt need to do it and we knew we didnt need to do it and they knew that we didnt need to do it we used them as an experiment for two atomic bombs this is quoted in gar alperovitz the decision to use the atomic bomb alperovitz by the way who did 30 years of research on the subject said i think it can be proven that the bomb not only was unnecessary but known in advance not to be necessary another quote henry h arnold commanding general of the unitedstates army air forces the japanese position was hopeless even before the first atomic bomb fell because the japanese had lost control of their own air fleet admiral chester w nimitz commander in chief of the unitedstates pacific fleet the japanese had in fact already sued for peace the atomic bomb played no decisive part from a purely military point of view in the defeat of japan the use of atomic bombs at hiroshima and nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against japan the japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender this is admiral william d leahy chief of staff to president truman certainly prior to 31 december 1945 and in all probability prior to 1 november 1945 japan would have surrendered even if atomic bombs had not been dropped thats from the unitedstates strategic bombing survey this is from major general curtis lemay the war would have been over in 2 weeks without the russians entering and without the atomic bomb the atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all now its just not
