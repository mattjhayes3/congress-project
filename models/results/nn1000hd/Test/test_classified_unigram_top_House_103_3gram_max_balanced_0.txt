largest tax increase in unitedstates history as part of a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit the president and the democrats raise new taxes without eliminating a single federal program in the first few years of the plan the plan includes a 71billion energytax and 32 billion in taxes on senior citizens according to several studies the energy tax will cost the unitedstates economy almost 600 000 jobs by 1998 and it will lower economic growth by 35 to 50 billion the energy tax will raise the cost of practically every good and service that americans produce resulting in higher prices for consumers and making american workers and companies less competitive in the world market the average american family of four will pay an additional 500 per year in energy costs as a result of the energy tax according to a study by the american petroleum institute this is in addition to the 2 150 that the average household already pays each year in energy costs a study by the affordable energy alliance shows that a large number of the states highpaying industries mining manufacturing construction and agricultureuse a lot of energy and will be the ones hardest hit by the tax if the clinton tax had been in effect in 1990 north carolina residents and industries would have paid 714 8 million in additional energy taxes the alliance notes that a tax burden this large will slow the economy of the state cost jobs and make goods and services produced in north carolina less competitive in world markets consider for example the case of a company in my district called the timken co the timken co is a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and alloy steels if the proposed energy tax becomes effective the direct cost impact on the company resulting from higher energy needs will be 5 6 million to put that in perspective the companys net income from worldwide operations amounted to only 4 5 milion in 1992 the energy tax will cost manufacturing jobs and diminish the ability of energyintensive industries like the timken co to compete in the international market clintons plan will also raise taxes on social security recipients under current law older americans with a modest income 25 000 for singles and 32 000 for couples pay income taxes on up to 50 percent of their social security benefits but under the clinton proposal seniors will pay taxes on up to 85 percent of their benefits this increase will raise 32 billion over 5 years a study by a senior advocacy group shows that the average senior citizen will pay 483 a year in new taxes finally the presidents plan will have a devastating effect on small businesses according to information from the national federation of independent business 80 percent of businesses in america pay taxes as individuals not as corporate entities the tax code also taxes the profits of a business not what the owner takes home this means that business owners are taxed on the money they reinvest back into their business as a result the clinton tax plan will increase taxes for individuals increase the tax burden on small business owners and hurt economic growth and expansion consider the following

what is expected to be record numbers on august 21 the electoral process will reflect a confluence of political will presidential vision for reform compromise by the major political parties and insistence on integrity in the electoral process by mexican voters significantly more than 90 percent of the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes which promise to change the face of the electoral process in mexico the mexicans have faced many challenges throughout this electoral reform era and campaign season not the least of which is the trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican history as our neighbors south of the border elect a new president 500 members of the chamber of deputies 96 senate seats as
