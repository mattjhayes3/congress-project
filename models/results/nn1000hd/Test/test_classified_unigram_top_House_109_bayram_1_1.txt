of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.04420548677444458, 0.9557945132255554, 1, "i want to thank the gentleman from washington for yielding me the customary 30 minutes i yield myself 5 minutes democrats have been saying again and again and again and again the american people want and deserve a clean upordown vote on raising the minimum wage and this rule does not provide for such a vote minimumwage workers want and deserve a clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that

we have heard today presents it as a noble and responsible attempt to respond to the harsh economic realities facing our nation and our people but when we examineit objectively we cant avoid seeing the reality behind the pretense the bill is designed to do everything it can to protect the record tax cuts for the richest of americans for the majority that is more important than educating our children or providing health care to the veterans or helping americans raise themselves out of poverty or even protecting our country from the consequences of either national disasters or mounting national debt the authors and supporters of the legislation will tell us that if we wish to avoid increasing our national deficit which they have already driven to unprecedented heights we have no choice but to spend on the programs that americans rely on the most while they are busily cutting out the revenues that come into the government but once again they are offering a false choice for 5 years they have forced the massive tax cuts through the congress last week they made the most recent down payment on the cuts one was 70 billion while president bush signs that bill into law today republicans are asking us to pass this bill which adds another 158 billion to those cuts so in 2 weeks we have made those massive cuts and any justification melts away when we realize who is benefiting from it they are not for the poor they are not for the working class they are not for the middle class they are for the oil companies they wont spur our economy or help the average person afford their morning drive to work they are instead the cuts for billionaires and millionaires pure and simple they are not going to help the economy but they will indeed help people who dont need it and that assistance will come at the expense of everyone else but as always the case despite objections not just from democrats but much of the american public reducing or extending these cuts isnt even on the table here it never is they are considered too sacred to touch and just tonight in the rules committee once again we turned down an opportunity to pay for more by taking away part of their tax cut what do we get in exchange for this giveaway well the majority offered us a budget that will cut domestic spending between 1 and 2 percent every year as a result the party that tells us to support the troops is cutting veterans health care by 6 billion and we worry and fear for the over 20 000 young soldiers in iraq and afghanistan who have been grievously lifealtering wounded will not be able to get the care they need when they come back republicans who promised to leave no child behind will be cutting education funding by 45 3 billion and the budget of the department of education by 2 2 billion now not content to make education less rewarding in the present they apparently want to make our students worry more about loan payments in the future the bill eliminates all mandatory spending on student loans leaving congressional appropriators to somehow find 600 million to meet the students needs the majority wants to cut environmental protection efforts by 25 billion and take over 1 billion from community development and social service initiatives which we desperately need the poorest of the poor wont find any relief at all in this legislation in fact they will find the opposite the budget will underfund housing and child care assistance by 447 million over the next year and over 5 years the funding for them will fall almost 15 billion short what will the results be well consider the fate of the commodity supplemental food program which provides nutritious meals to 420 000 lowincome elderly and 50 000 mothers and children at a cost of 111 million a year the budget eliminates it entirely it may make sense that they are forcing the cuts through congress so they can afford the handouts to the rich but perhaps that really is what todays republican party stands for but apparently they also stand for something new contrary to their rhetoric irresponsible government spending the legislation before us will increase our deficit without a vote by 410 billion over the next 5 years at the same time it increases the debt limit by over 650 billion by 2011 the limit will stand at 9 6 trillion when the clinton administration left office the debt limit was about 4 5 trillion and they left us the greatest surplus we have ever had the majority claims the bill will make us more fis cally secure but what they really do is sow the seeds of greater insecurity both now and for years to come when we realize that it isnt necessity driving this bill but rather a world view that puts the richest americans ahead of everybody else we are not left with much else to say but shame we dont share these values democrats believe instead as did that great republican president theodore roosevelt and countless other americans that investing in the middle class which is disappearing quickly and guaranteeing broad prosperity is the surest way to ensure sustained economic growth"], [0.061282992362976074, 0.9387170076370239, 1, "i just want to make sure mr ryan that the american people understand what is happening in the present wedo not even have to go as far back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a bipartisan way and it will not be like it is now and it will not be business as usual and it will not be well i dont care if you do not like it"], [0.07189404964447021,

fiscal year of 2006 and with no budget in place for fiscal 2007 i commend my distinguished democratic colleagues on the budget committee for takingthis time to call americas attention to the fiscal challenges resulting from the republicans misguided policies and the wrong choices they have made for our economy misplaced spending priorities and bad decisions have consequences they are leading us further down the path to fiscal ruin and expanding the wedge between middleclass families and the superwealthy i am proud to join my colleagues to highlight the hypocrisy of the overriding republican economic philosophy that extending dividends capital gains and other tax cuts for millionaires and corporations create a rising tide that lifts all boats five years after the presidents 1 5 trillion tax cut our national debt now approaches 10trillion if our tax cuts performed as promised by those across the aisle an exploding economy would have wiped out this debt we have already proven that more needs to be done than just hope that sooner or later tax cuts will reach americans who need help the most but those who do need help must get in line and hope that the benefits of tax cuts for millionaires and corporations will ultimately trickle down to them perhaps the expanding gulf between the haves and the almosthaves is best illustrated by the fact that wages and salaries now make up the lowest share of gross domestic product since the government began keeping records on that in 1947 while corporate profits continue to break alltime records meanwhile the buying power of the minimum wage has sunk to its lowest level in 50 years what is missing are policies that ensure that the benefits of higher corporate earnings productivity and globalization are widely shared such as real government support for higher education a progressive tax code and affordable health care when choices are made at the expense of our safety net choices that benefit the top 1 percent who will never struggle to pay a mortgage never struggle to keep up with gas prices never struggle to put their children through school it is clear that a new direction for our economy is long overdue how can the republicans argue that this economy is bound in the right direction when our nation is saddled with recordbreaking deficits over 4 consecutive years combined with deep and painful cuts to hospitals to schools and to security at least the republicans budget outlook since 2001 has been consistent americans could bank on the american budgets to slash funding for proven homeland security programs veterans benefits education and health care priorities all the while cutting taxes for millionaires who need the break the least as reallife indicators of poor federal spending choices such as stagnant wages soaring crime rates and rising health care premiums and drug prices begin to take their toll on americans it is our responsibility to react instead inaction reigns under the direction of the current leadership in some cases this inaction has yielded to halfhearted solutions such as an energy bill that does more for oil aild gas companies than lower gas prices a medicare bill that does more for drug companies and hmos than make lifesaving drugs affordable a pension bill that takes it easy on corporate boards while ignoring the decline of traditional defined benefit plans eleven days away from the start of the fiscal year the record of this republican congress on the economy shows that we have not completed a budget or a single appropriations bill fiscal irresponsibility has reached unprecedented new lows depending on how you look at it the debt limit has been raised for the fifth time in as many years to almost 10 trillion perhaps we shouldnt be worried after all the presidents budget director said last month that 200 billion annual deficits are sustainable indefinitely apparently normal budget rules dont apply to this administration but they do apply to a middleclass family of four living on long island whose monthly costofliving expenses due mostly to rising gas prices and health care costs are rapidly exceeding wage increases perhaps their creditors and collection agents will understand that outstanding debts owed by families sinking deeper into red ink are sustainable indefinitely we can fix this mess we have the blueprint a new direction for america and we only need to look to past and proven methods like the payasyougo budget rules that were enforced in the previous administration and produced surpluses that helped us start buying down our national debt indeed we democrats resolve to restore what should be the goals of our federal budget to reflect the priority of our nation to build a strong economy and to set policies

government will deliver up to 106 billion to the multiple bank accounts of some of the wealthiest americans this government program to help wealthy americans spend more money now forces a false crunch on our resources a 50 billion cut that republicans believe should come from medicaid food stamps and student loans who will feel the impact of these cuts well almost 60percent of all people in nursing homes who are on medicaid and onethird of all babies who are born on medicaid and 8 million americans with disabilities who depend on medicaid and 36 million americans who have to worry about going hungry how do we as a congress reconcile the fact that these cuts will disproportionately affect lowincome americans the elderly and the poor the answer is we should not reconcile ourselves to such an action not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the proposedcuts are robbing the poor of opportunity the reconciliation budget targets programs that work to bridge the gap between rich and poor medicaid food stamps and student loans

scratching out desperate signs on rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we

and each day in america 2 385 more babies are born into poverty the republicans will say that society has little obligation to help the poor because they fail to take personal responsibility for their lives the united states has highest gdp in the world we are first in military technology first in military exports first in gross domestic product first in the number of millionaires and billionaires and first in health technology but we rank 12th in living standards among our poorest onefifth 13th in the gap between rich and poor 14th in efforts to lift children out of poverty 18th in the percent of children in poverty and 37th in the health status of our citizens we should be working to close these gaps and ensure that all americans have a fair chance at life and are treated with basic human dignity instead this reconciliation plan will take away food health care education and the abilityto live in dignity in old age from people who have no other options this budget will proliferate existing inequalities i simply cannot reconcile this budget with my values because this budget does not reflect who we are as a nation and what we believe our responsibility is to other americans we

concerned about the debt the deficit the budget and we are committed to trying to restore some common sense and fiscal discipline to our nations government and our nations budgeting process ever since i was a small child growing up in prescbtt emmet and hope arkansas i always heard it was the democrats that spent the money and yetit was a president named bill clinton from arkansas from my hometown of hope arkansas in fact that gave this nation its first balanced budget in 40 years from 1988 through 2001 america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having its fiscal house in order america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having a balanced budget it is hard now to believe that from 1998 through 2001 this country had a balanced budget because as we all know for the sixth year in a row this nation under this republicanled congress and under this president this administration has given us the largest budget deficit ever ever in our nations history for a sixth year in a row as a matter of fact as you walk the halls of congress it is easy to spot a fiscally conservative democrat because the 37 of us who belong to the blue dog coalition have this poster outside our office in the halls of congress as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 365 525 832 151 and some change that is a big number let us put it in a way that we all can understand it for every man woman and child including those born this 1ast hour every citizen of americas share of the national debt is 28 000 and some change where i come from very few of my constituents can afford to write a check for 28 000 and yet it is this kind of debt this kind ofdeficit that we are saddling on our children and grandchildren and expectingther someday to pay back and i believe it is morally wrong i raise these issues because you see my grandparents left this country better than they found it for my parents and my parents left this country better than they found it for my generation and i believe we have a duty and an obligation to try and leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for the next generation but instead for the sixth year in a row we have the largest budget deficit ever inour nations history this administration this republican congress continues to pass tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year just in the last few months this congress passed the socalled budget deficit reduction act here is~what it did it cut medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor disabled and elderly it cut student loans and a program for orphans to the tune of 40 billion and then they passed another tax cut to the tune of about 90 billion i was not real good in math in high school or college but you can do the math on that some 90 billion in tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year 40 billion in cuts to medicaid to orphan programs and to student loans that amounts to 50 billion in additional debt and yet the republican leadership in this body had the nerve to call it the deficit reduction act i believe it is time for those of us in the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition to rise up and hold this administration this congress responsible for these kinds of reckless spending habits that destroy future generations the budget the president has submitted for fiscal year 2007 some 2 8 trillion you have to givelit to him he has managed to cut all of the programs that matter to people health care education infrastructure economic development and yet give us the largest budget deficit ever in our nations history all at the same time how does he do that because he continues to propose to borrow money from foreign lenders foreign central banks foreign investors to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year what has it given us it has given us a debt of 8 365 525 832 151 by the time we complete this hour the national debt will have risen more than 41 million every tuesday night those of us in the blue dog coalition we are 37 members strong we come here to talk about the debt and the deficit and what it means not only to todays generation but to future generations because you see these are big numbers they are big numbers but let me put it in perspective not only is our nation borrowing about a billion dollars a day we are sending 279 million every day to iraq but do not dare ask the president how he is spending it or if he has a plan for how it is to be spent because he will tell you that you are unpatriotic some 57 million is going every day to afghanistan and on top of that our nation is spending the first half a billion we collect in your tax money each and every day simply to pay interest not principal just interest on the national debt we need 149 in my congressional district i need 1 5 billion to complete it give me 3 days interest on the national debt i can build 149 on the eastern side we are waiting on 169 give me 3 days interest on the national debt and i can complete

think we need to have with regard to the immigration policy across the nation about domestic enforcement and shutting off the jobs magnet and also about the need to stop the bleeding at our southern border and so i had gone down to the border about a year ago and spent a long weekend down there at least 3 days on the ground and in the air as a guest of the border patrol hnd some of the other agencies that operate the security along the border and i was given a very good tour and a few rides in helicopters at night and also in the daytime shining the night sun down along our bbrder to identify where there might be illegals that have come across or future illegals preparing to come across and i stopped and visited some of the stations and their equipment and talked to the men i was impressed with the quality of the team people that they had assembled the equipment they had assembled and the tactics they had yet in that full long weekend i did not actually see activity which would indicate to a reasonable person that there was not activity to be seen in spite all of those hours in the air and the hours on the ground and the night vision equipment i did not again see any illegal activities although i got many reports of the success of the interdictionof our border patrol and our other agencies well as i listen to the debate here in the house of representatives and the testimony that comes before the immigration subcommittee which i sit upon and i sit in those hearings two three even four times a week and we will have four sometimes eight witnesses giving us credible data and good wellinformed information on this issue from both sides of the issue and always the years the cumulative information has built in me after those years of sitting on the immigration subcommittee i began to think that i have a pretty decent broad background on the subject and yet there was a gap there was a gap in that subject because i had not gone down and spent time on the border more or less unguided moreor less outside the scope of the border patrol but gone ahead and gone down to the border and looked under all the stones and met with the people that were actually more likely to be more frank with me so that was my mission this past weekend where i spent perhaps as much as 4 days on the ground in arizona and the goal was to meet with the people that are enforcing our laws down there the ones that are out in the night and those people who have seen this bleeding this hemorrhaging at our border firsthand that can describe to me the scope of the bleeding in our southern border i am here to say tonight that it is astonishing it is far worse than i had imagined and my imagination was fairly strong my predictions and the numbers that i put out were fairly aggressive at least viewed by some of my critics but there is nothing i saw down on the border over the weekend that would cause me to believe that i have overstated the numbers of people who are illegally crossing our border or the amount of drugs illegal drugs that are coming across our border or the amount of violence that is visited because of the drug problem both south of the border north of the border and the violence that goes throughout the drug culture in america and the collateral damage to the victims that may not be associate with that at all but happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are victims of murder victims of negligent homicide generally in the form of a car accident where the driver who was at fault was under the influence of alcohol or drugs so what i did was go down to visit in a region starting out on friday in a region south of tucson south and a little bit east of tucson i first met with a special agent who briefed me on a lot of information that had been coming by this individual on a consistent basis and then i went to bisbee arizona where i went on down then to the border there to naco arizona right on the border with mexico that is a location that has seen a fair amount of violence and a lot of concentration of illegal traffic going along the border they finaljy decided to establish and build a fence i was guided to that location by a retired border patrol officer and a rancher from that region both with a passion of patriotism for america both that have a memory of growing up in an america and that part of arizona that was a different kind of country than it is today it was then a place that they could feel safe in their streets and safe in their homes and walk the streets and not lock their homes and today that region has been flooded with just thousands and tens of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of illegals many of them carrying illegal drugs through that region and cars drive across the border where sometimes there had been an existing fence that was built originally to contain livestock that fence has essentially been systematically broken down and vehicles with drugs and illegals in them would drive right through the gaps in the fence sometimes drive through the fence and take off across the desert or cut across over to a highway and get up on the highway and once they were on the highway for a little ways they were gone they were free they were in america not ever to be captured again not ever to be accountable again unless they were just simply victims of bad luck they realized the magnitude of this problem at naco arizona and went in and built a fence through there it is built out of interlocking steel that sometimes ean be 10 feet high or higher and then above that in some cases they have welded a kind of wire mesh that goes up another 4 to 6 feet and when they originally built the fence people said it would not work it cannot work people will go over it they will go through they will go under it or they will go around it in fact they do go around it at one point they picked up a cutting torch and cut a hole through it and made their own gate in that solid steel fence and that was a pathway by which people and drugs traveled into the united states and some went back through that gate and the patrol went there and welded the gate shut and as they kept some maintenance up on the fence the other side essentially gave up on trying to breech the fence 2230 now the illegal traffic goes around the end as one reason rather than trying to find a way through a barrier that is a good solid barrier that has been very very effective the border patrol officer whom i was there with and the rancher whom i was there with said look at this and they described the problem they used to have about the thousands of people pouring across there they said we do not have that problem anymore this community is safer than it was it is more secure than it was there is far less illegal traffic going through here there is far less crime of all kinds far less violence and far fewer illegal drugs in this community brecause we built a barrier that kept the elements out that were eroding our quality of life in naco arizona that was an interesting trip and they took me out along the border where that fence essentially stops and diminishes in some locations there is nothing there not even a way to define where the border is between the united states and mexico but simply open places where illegals can walk across the border and one location just in a dry river bed or they would not be seen by night vision they were protected by the shrubbery and vegetation they could simply walk down from mexico into the united states unimpeded unobstructed unobserved and become shadow people here in the united states doing whatever they do they were strong advocates of the border barrier and one that is solidly built and one that can be efficient and is becoming a tool that could very much support our law enforcement and let them focus their energy on plans that could be more effective than riding herd on a broad length of an unprotected border it is ridiculous to think that we could ever hire enough people to sit along the border especially at night and watch people come across and then catch them rather than put in a fence that would not allow them to come across in the first place that was naco arizona and again i learned a lot about the culture and the level of corruption on the south side of the border it was an interesting conversation from there i went down then to the reservation and was a guest of a number of the shadow wolves who are part of the customs and border patrol actually today they are a part of the border patrol they have been shifted to that but it is on the tohono oodham reservation and on the reservation the native americans control that land they have support of the border patrol but they have had an organization there called the shadow wolves they are federal employees and their responsibility is to guard the border and interdict illegal drugs and illegal aliens they are focusing on illegal drugs their peak recruitment the top numbers there were 22 and when they were 22 strong in fact that does not sound like a very large group given the size of the reservation and given the miles of border that they have to protect and i believe that number is 76 miles of border protected and controlled by 22 shadow wolves members of the tohono oodham tribe on the reservation but those 22 in the period of a year i have got to dig up the statistics so i will be able to release those and publish those but the information i received that they had intefdicted more illegal drugs in a 12month period of time with 22 of their shadow wolves than all 2 000 border patrol agents did in that entire sector for the same period of time that is an extraordinary example of effectiveness and efficiency and it is the kind of thing that we here in this congress need to endorse and support and encourage and fund and authorize and protect and encourage and enhance do all of things that we can do to identify the best among us to encourage them to grow that gulture off beyond the bounds of the reservation take that same culture of efficiency and enforcement on to the other reservations whether native american tribes that control land on our national boundaries with our neighbors and the level of success that has been there has not been rewarded it has not been encouraged it has not been enhanced by the border patrol who seems to want to be seeking to undermine their efforts and absorb them into the broader border patrol in which case if they did that the shadow wolves would lose their identity these people have an extraordinary amount of character and courage and conviction and pride in what they do but like anyone if they do not see a reward for that if they do not see some kindof encouragement if they do not understand that here in congress we are supporting them eventually they will be assimilated into the border patrol and their level of efficiency will be assimilated into the broader overall level of efficiency in the border patrol now i do not mean to imply that the border patrol is not efficient or that they may not have the kind of personnel that i would like to see in fact they have some very extraordinarily brave noble hardworking officers and many of them the structure has become big and it has become difficult to be efficient so i am not here to discourage them i am here to encourage them and i often shake their hands and thank them for what they do because they are the last line of defense along our border to protect us from the incursions of millions that take place in this country every single night but what i saw from the shadow wolves was not ohly some of the history in their legacy and their efficiency and effectiveness but i went out in the field with them and watched the way that they follow the border when they see that there has been a border crossing there they will pick up that sound that track if you will and they will follow that track down and hunt down the illegals sometimes they are carrying backpacks of illegal drugs sometimes they are just people entering the united states illegally but they will find that track and get on a trot and follow that track and trace them to where they are pick them up and detain them and then process them in a fashion in accordance with law again their effort has been extraordinary in some of the things that they showed and taught me too much to go in depth here on the floor of the house of representatives but quite a lot of extraordinary skill that appears to me would be very constructive if it could be passed along to other agencies out there particularly the broader border patrol but the culture is there as well as more important the skills to protect the culture of the shadow wolves it is extraordinary i was impressed with what they do and i intend to support and encourage and enhance them i will be looking for a way legislatively to demonstrate my commitment to their commitment to protect our border and defend us against the illegal incursions into the united states and the thousands and thousands of pounds of illegal drugs that come across ourborder every single day many of them still pouring through the tohono oodham reservation and in spite of the best efforts of the nowshrunken shadow wolves down from 22 to 16 to cover those 76 miles of border fence so again i have been extraordinarily impressed but they have done their job from there i traveled outside the reservation and went over then jo the cabeza prieta national wildlife refuge and met with some people there some national parks people and department of the interior forest rangers seventyfive percent of their work which they signed up to do would be to protect our natural resources preserve our parks enhance our parks let mother nature be enhanced there so that the visiting public could come into these locations like the cabeza prieta national refuge and be able to appreciate mother nature in its purest form that is why our forest rangers and our park officers got into the business because they appreciate wildlife they appreciate our plant life they appreciate how the species of nature have balanced in these regions and how they have grown and they try to enhance that they find that 75 percent of their time their border patrol officers even 75 percent of their time is spent protecting the border 75 percent of the time keeping illegals and illegal drugs out of the park not a successful effort i might add and perhaps a futile effort but an effort that needs to be attempted nonetheless with dozens and dozens of abandoned vehicles sitting out across the national wildlife refuge vehicles that have blazed a trail through there and hundreds of miles of roads have been carved through that national wildlife refuge because that was the most expeditious route for smugglers to drive their suburbans and their 4wheel drive pickups and you name your vehicle there and there will be somebody else behind you and the next night another and another and another that formerly pristine desert turns into sometimes a 200foot wide path after it has been pounded in the desert with traffic enough times it turns into what they call moon dust just loose dust that lays there in ruts in a way that you can get stuck in that dust 200 feet wide perhaps before this was a few less than 10 years ago in fact starting about 1998 was when these border incursions began and when they began to create these roads and these trails and tear up our natural resources the people that are dying in an attempt to get across the desert have gone from a couple of years ago or 3 years ago 150 175 a year now across our southern border as many as 450 a year do not make it across the desert when they seek to walk into the united states they die of hypothermia they die of exposure they die of dehydration more dehydration than anything else the desert is not very forgiving and some of them are not very well prepared they are not very wellguided and that human tragedy is exacerbated by the damage to our natural resources which i had a i will say less than enhanced appreciation for i really learned to respect and appreciate the work that is done by our department of the interior as well as the value of the resources that they are seeking to protect a case in point i think illustrates this better than anything else would be a rare species of a bat a long nose bat and this is an endangered species it only lives and reproduces in four caves and those caves are all down in that region one of those caves was a cave that was frequented consistently by the illegals who would go up into the region and then their guide and their track would take them to this cave where the baby bats were born they began taking a stop off and temporary residence in the cave to the point where they scared the bats off and they would not come back in the long nose bat the lesser long nose bat left the cave would not come back to reproduce and so our national park service looked at that situation said we have to protect this resource and if this happens in the other three caves there will be no place for these bats to reproduce who knows if they will become extinct so they put up a wrought iron fence around the opening to this cave cost 75 000 and there is other labor that was not tallied in put the wrought iron fence around the cave and it was built in way to keep the illegals out of the cave fortunately tile lesser long nose bats returned to the cave and they are in there now living there and reproducing but think about it for a moment if you would the effect of building a fence just around the entrance of the cave that provided a deterrent that allowed the bats to come back and live there again and reproduce and fly out and they are really essential they are essential then to the pollination of certain cactus ou there in the desert without which the cactus would not survive it has a whole set of chain reactions i am submitting that we build a fence on the border because it is a lot cheaper to do than it is to build a fence around everything that is threatened from the illegals and the drug trade that comes from our southern border that was the lesson there at the cabeza prieta national wildlife refuge that being a second stop or actually a third stop along the way and then from there i went on over to organ pipe national cactus monument organ pipe is another national monument location and that is the location where the national park service officer his name was chris eggle was killed in a shootout with drug lords near the mexican border in the park property i went there with his father bob i visited the location where the shooting took place where he stood where the shooter laid where he fell where there is a monument there today that was built and placed by his father bob and his mother bonnie well they brought stones from their farm in michigan down to place around the monument and there is a cross and a picture and a place to remember where this happened where it happened that chris was killed by a drug lord or at least an employee of a drug lord who had driven across the mexican border where there was no barrier when he was being under hot pursuit by the mexican police and his vehicle broke down and collapsed and stopped across the border into the united states and chris eggle and his partner were called in on that scene as they split up and converged on the location where the drug smuggler was chris was ambushed with an ak47 that had been brought into the united states illegal of course on a vehicle that was illegal with drugs that were illegal across a border that was undefined let alone defined with a barrier e 2245 had there been a vehicle barrier there had there been a fence there chris eggle would be alive today he is not there is a memorial there at the organ pipe cactus national monument that memorializes him as well i talked to many of his coworkers that were there his spirit is alive and his spirit is strong today the happy chris eggle is the one that is remembered although he is not with us his spirit is with us and his sacrifice is something we need to remember he is not the only one he is not the first one i pray he will be the last one but i saw nothing down there that would indicate to me that he will be the last one that tragedy taught them something at organ pipe after the tragedy of chris death at the hands of the drug runner whom the mexicans were chasing into the united states and by the way that drug runner was subsequently shot and killed by the mexican police department he was in the united states and shot from their side of the border that is not an issue with me but as a matter of full disclosure i point that out the lesson learned from that was to close the border at least shut off the vehicle traffic so they have built a vehicle barrier along organ pipe and it is most of the way along the organ pipe national monument it is perhaps 32 miles altogether as i look at that and travel along the side of that border it is built so that steel posts full of concrete set in the ground and then it has got horizontal barriers about two of those one about eye height and one about halfway up designed so that vehicles cant drive through it but the desert pronghorn can run through it and jackrabbits can run through it and any kind of wildlife can go back and forth through there they had trouble with cattle moving in from mexico so they stretched a couple of barbed wires in there to keep the cattle on the mexican side of course those barbed wires were cut because the people who were jumping the border thought it was an obstruction to have to climb over one barbed wire so they cut the fence we drove through and picked a place where the illegal traffic was going across and they were demonstrating how that tracking takes place as they did with the shadow wolves on their reservation what i saw in a number of places it got to where you could pick it out easily every night traffic coming into the national monument and paths that are beaten so smooth one of the officers said well one day well shut off this illegal traffic and it will be a nice path for citizens to come down here and visit our park because it is already smoothed out it is kind of graded out by all the foot traffic in fact in one of those locations the traffic goes across the fence and right by a sign and the sign says do not enterinto the united states this is a dangerous place the sun is hot you can die in the desert there h2327 isnt water for you there are snakes there are scorpions its dangerous turn back cynically the path goes right by the sign the sign is in spanish if they can read they can read that but in a way i think it is cynically they go by that sign just to send us a message fiftyeight percent of mexicans believe they have a right to come to the united states they are utterly wrong but we need to convey that message to them so that they can understand that the united states needs to be committed to enforcing our borders the incidents that happened down there illustrate what i saw first the argument as i asked the officers retired border patrol or current officers who were at the point of retiring or quitting and giving up those were the kind of people that would talk to me they were the people that would open up to me one of them was an officer at a station no one would talk to me because the orders were you dont speak to a member of congress you dont talk to anybody from government your job is to do your job but not to tell anyone what that job is what the statistics are in your area so they sent me to an individual there who is near retirement and that individual was willing to speak in fact numbers of those individuals were willing to speak with me some ready to quit some ready to retire some retired they would talk to me straight up and open they didnt care about the consequences for that they care about this country they care about our border security and our border control and they understand that you cantbe a nation if you dont have a border you cant call it a border if you dont defend your border i hear the testimony here in congress as the border patrol testifies before the immigration subcommittee and consistently it is we stop 25 to 331 3 percent of the illegals that are traveling across our border i have used that number consistently in my remarks across this country and i ask that question of the people that are down there in the line on the line defending our national security and i would say what percentage do you stop where do you stand they would hesitate in their answer and i would say 25 to 33 percent do you stop a fourth do you stop a third how many do you stop they would laugh and give me a number one of them burst out in hysterical laughter when i submitted that they could be successful in stopping 25 percent of the illegal traffic he responded back to me no its more like 3 percent of the illegal traffic of the illegals coming into the united states do we stop and perhaps 5 percent of the illegal drugs its not 25 percent its not 33 percent in fact its not 10 percent but of the informed answers that i got down there and i asked it at every stop the informed answers that i got i never got an informed answer above 10 percent of anybody that was involved in actual protection of the border and processing people that were coming through that border ten percent now think about it for a moment 10 percent last year we apprehended about 1 188 000 illegal entrants into the united states on our southern border on that 2 000mile run 1 188 000 if that number is correct on 10 percent if you move that decimal point one over that is 11 880 000 attempts to cross the border you can take perhaps a couple of million off that if you wanted to be generous and take it down to 10 million succeeded i dont think actually 10 million succeeded coming into the united states but i do think the number is far higher than the numbers that we are working with in the media today we have used the number here 11 million illegals in america we used the number for 3 years while 4 million people a year at least were coming across the border maybe a lot more than that and over 3 years the number didnt accumulate but about 500 000 a year even less so after 3 years we finally raised the number to 12 million but no one now pays attention to that we are still back stuck in that 11 million mode of illegals in america that number is far higher than 11 million maybe we are successful in stopping 10 percent maybe the individual who advised me that 3 percent of illegals and 5 percent of the illegal drugs maybe he was off by a factor of oh lets say two maybe it is 6 percent of the illegals and 10 percent of the illegal drugs however you measure this it is astonishing in its magnitude in the cost to this country in fact we are headed down a path it wont be very much longer that everyone who wants to come to the united states will be here the message was sent january 6 2004 when our esteemed commander in chief gave a speech it is called in america the amnesty speech it was the one that said here is the pplicy that we want to have it is one of a guest worker temporary worker as the only solution if you have too many illegals in america i suppose the quickest and cheapest and the most guaranteed solution one could have is simply legalize them all give them all amnesty give them a path to citizenship voila no problem we have fixed the problem because we have legalized them all by a version of amnesty the american people reject amnesty in this country they understand that we have to have a rule of law that citizenship must be precious that you must respect the rule of law there is more to being an american than having somebody stamp automatic citizenship on your green card or on your matricular consular card there is more to being an american than that being an american is rooted in and based upon a common culture an understanding and a common sense of experience and history of reverence and respect for our borders for the sovereignty of the united states of america for the destiny of this country for the assimilation that has made us so great that have been able to take immigrants in from all over the world bring them into this great giant melting pot of america give them this opportunity and let them reach out and earn and succeed in this opportunity for success the legal immigrants in america have performed extraordinarily well in fact the vigor that they bring to our society and our economy surpasses much of the vigor that we find in the nativeborn americans that are here all of us in this congress support a rational immigration policy that is designed to enhance the economic social and cultural wellbeing of america but if we have an open borders policy and the people that advocate for an open borders policy are really advocating for an unlimited amount of immigration everyone who might want to come here to the united states could come here and if all 6 billion people on the planet want to arrive here in the same year that is fine with them they dont take a stand that there is such a thing as too much immigration even too much illegal immigration they will not stand in the way of one of them they will not stand up and say the best thing you can do for your country is to stay in your country grow its economy be part of the solution bring reform to the governments of places like mexico and points south places that are so utterly corrupt that the economy is strangled places that are so corrupt that there has to be pro tection paid at every stop along the way that you cant get a birth certification when you are born in a country unless you happen to be born into a family that has the connections and maybe is willing to pay the kind of funds to pay off the madrina network that is there so that you can get your birth certificate and somebody identify who you are and be able to move around in this society or that society the level of corruption is astonishing it runs deep i would add to this that in spite of all the statistics that i could tell you in fact i will go to some of those statistics in a moment but first i would like to recount a few incidents that really bring home the circumstances and reality as i was there on the tohono oodham reservation with the shadow wolves there was a drug smuggler who was pulled over and stopped we were out in the desert tracking some illegals and getting a feel for how that worked and excellently being guided while this was on there was a call to an emergency and a number of the shadow wolves mobilized and they called in a black hawk helicopter that was there to aerially observe a vehicle that may 9 2006 co was escaping from the ground people they followed the vehicle and got it trapped up into a deadend road and the driver took off and ran and they followed him and finally apprehended him they brought him and the pickup the small truck as i would say to some of my other friends in america into the compound there where the shadow wolves headquarters is and looked the vehicle over it looked like it had been reworked that they had taken it through a body shop and created a false floor underneath the bed of that pickup the bed itself had a plastic liner in it so you couldnt see the bodywork that had been done we looked that over and they pointed out to me how that work was done it was done in a chopshop in mexico once they got the clearance to go ahead and search the truck they went in with the jaws of life and peeled the bed of that vehicle up and apart in there we carried out 18 large bales of marijuana about 10 pounds or more per bale at least 180 pounds of marijuana lying underneath that 6 to 8inch false floor of that vehicle the alleged perpetrator and i did lay eyes on him and evaluated him i guess for my own perspective he had a 13 tattooed on his arm many other tattoos all over his chest and arms it was clear to the people there that he was ms13 mara salxatrucha 13 the most dangerous gang that we have ever seen in this continent that dangerous gang of course is smuggling drugs up into the united states they had collared one of their members one of their perpetrators who was then in that holding cell i was there to help unload the drugs from the pickup there to observe this entire process there recorded and there to burn it into my memory that we think of a large quantity of drugs where i come from it night be oh perhaps a few pounds occasionally we get larger loads coming up through iowa of course but when somebody says a lot of illegal drugs we are thinking of a quantity substantially smaller than 180 pounds they think of 180 pounds or 200 pounds of illegal marijuana as a decoy a decoy that might be designed to draw the law enforcement down another path so that when the path clears when all the law enforcement pounces on the decoy then the larger loads can come through the 1 000 pounds the 2 600pound loads the full semi loads can start up the road it is a fact that on those drug routes those highways that flow from the southern part of arizona up into the rest of the united states on those small mountains that are there there are lookouts on every strategic point those lookouts are manned by two people and they are supplied regularly and they stay on that mountain for 2week stretches at a time they are well armed they have good equipment they have night vision goggles infrared equipment for daylight they have topnotch optical equipment and they have automatic weapons of all kinds and they have good food and good support and they sit up there and they have good communications so that they can radio from mountaintop to mountaintop and be able to tell each other where our drug enforcement people where our border patrol are where the ice people are where the special agents are where the park service people are so that when the coast is clear they canrun their large load of drugs up through the corridors now this is an astonishing thing to be able to see that military positions in the united states are occupied by the drug lords and their troops and that they are well equipped and well armed and well maintained and well supplied and they are manned 24 7 by two people and we are sitting down here on the floor of this congress thinking we can get a handle on this some other way but the numbers coming across the border are astonishing and the positions that are taken on those mountaintops where the lookouts are are shocking that we would tolerate that in this country know they are there but not go up and take them out the volume of drugs again is something beyond my imagination before going down there i had never seen such a pile of illegal drugs our federal agencies report that 90 percent of the illegal drugs in the united states come across the mexican border and the value of those drugs is in the area of 60 billion a year and we sit here in the united states of america we tolerate such a thing such a thing that we would let foreign interests foreign economic interests illegal interests violate our laws and enrich themselves with the wealth of a nation and the drug addiction that is here in america of course feeds it and that is another subject for another time that is something that we need to address that is one incident the interdiction of about 180 pounds of marijuana by the shadow wolves during a later afternoon down on the tohono oodham reservation but the following evening as i was looking around i went down to a place called sasabe and that again is on the border with mexico i visited a port of entry there that is manned by the border patrol they didnt expect that i was coming i didnt call in advance i just drove down there and got out of the vehicle and began to talk to them good people they are doing their job there and they are doing it well as far as i can see as i began to have a conversation with them there was an emergency call there had been a drug deal that had gone bad on the other side of the border in the mexican community just on the south side of that port of entry usually it is a shooting but this was a knifing and the subject who was knifed had a large wound in his abdomen about 32 inches wide entered in below the ribs on the right side and up through and it did end up lacerating his liver it didnt get his lung as far as i know but the word came that the ambulance was going to cross from mexico into the united states and they prepared for that they called in a medivac from the hospital in tucson and the medivac by the time it arrived there had been two unitedstates ambulances that had arrived the mexican ambulance didnt have any oxygen didnt have bandages had only surgical gloves on it was a paramedic that was with me lent himself right to the task and began to stabilize the patient when the oxygen came they put oxygen on the patient and held him stable until they could load him onto the helicopter and airlift him out to the tucson hospital all at the cost of the american taxpayer and the cost ofthis i will get compiled over time the ambulance that came across from mexico simply parked on the united states side two ambulances came in one from near tucson one from 24 miles away one brought oxygen the other was there for support and all lent a hand to get him loaded on the helicopter and flew him up to university hospital in tucson where they do a great job and they have the only trauma center in all of southern arizona it was a real eye opener for me to see this individual who had been knifed in this fight covered with tattoos and substantially pierced and inebriated with alcohol and cocaine at his own admission as part of the contributor i think to the violence on the other side and i am advised that that kind of incident wasnt just a fluke and i kidded the border patrol officer you staged this for me of course he didnt he didnt know i was going to be there but it happens about four times a quarter in that location alone roughly 16 times a year more shootings than stabbings when we evacuate people out from mexico into united states hospitals and so i followed up yesterday and visited the hospital and visited the patient and he had been stabilized and his life had been saved without that extraordinary effort it is likely he would not have survived the next few hours but his life appears now that it has been saved and i am grateful for that but i also met wifh the hospital administrators and they are eating millions of dollars of costs in funding the people who are generally illegals in the united states they dont separate that cost from those that are evacuated from an injury or a wound that takes place on the mexican side of the border but the american taxpayers fund this the american ratepayers fund this and the hospital swallows a fair amount of it and there have been occasions where residents and american citizens of tucson arent able to be treated because all the beds are full full of people who are illegally in the united states and so that health care for the tucson residents the americans occasionally will go to phoenix and then the family members that live in the city have to drive to phoenix to visit their family and just the travel time puts their lives at risk as well thats two incidents and i did follow up on those and i will follow up on the information that comes from it i would add the third incident was i went down to the border last night down to the san miguel gate on the reservation sat in the dark for 3 hours and listened and it wasnt difficult to hear the vehicles bring the illegals down near the border drop them off and hear them talking hear them hush up and then single file go through the desert brush cross the border into the united states and be off to points unknown 4 i used to believe that it was the illegal traffic into the united states that was the biggest problem and that illegal drugs was a problem that was part of that and i am informed that when we put the barriers in there the vehicle barriers that since they cant drive across the border with illegal drugs any longer in some of the locations there are many places where they can they simply put 50 pounds of marijuana in a backpack on one young male mexican or central american generally mexicans and each one takes a backpack of 50 pounds each maybe 10 of them at a time maybe 25 at a time they have caught as many ks a hundred at a time walking each with 50 pounds and they can walk through 10 or 15 or more miles of desert on the mexico side 25 or more miles of desert on the unitedstates side and arrive up at a transportation predetermined location and then drop off their illegal drugs there and many of them turn around and walk back to mexico where they pick up another load so the illegal crossings many of those illegal crossings are people coming into the united states with illegal drugs turning back around and walking back into mexico to get another load of illegal drugs sometimes i wonder if we wouldnt be better off in this country if they would simply stay here and get a job illegal or not and i dont advocate that certainly so as i listeiied nd was there while illegals were creeping across our borer in the dead of the night not even 24 hours ago and it is another dimension entirely to see the drugs the interdiction of the drugs the violence on the border the knifing the blood the lack of health care that is there the incursions on our border the volume that is backpacked up into the united states the volume that is trucked into the united states and to understand that if we can seal this border and seal it with confidence we could shut off 90 percent of the illegal drugs that get by in the united states at least until they find another route to go around but we can build an effective barrier and as i submitted that to the people down there working on the border consistently they realize that if we build a good solid barrier one that couldnt be cut through one that couldnt be driven through one that was solid and one that would make it easy for them to drive the trail and enforce it that it could be the most effective tool that we could have it costs us 6 billion a year to incarcerate the illegals here in the united states twentyeight percent of our prison population are criminal aliens that is our city our county our state and our federal penitentiaries 28 percent criminal aliens 6 billion a year we can build one tremendous barrier with 6 billion and a onetime expenditure of course we wouldnt get it all built in 1 year so we could spread it out over 3 or 4 years and we could concentrate on the areas that needed it the most we must do that stop the bleeding stop the bleeding first shut off the leaky pipe and then we can begin to have a legitimate debate in this country on what to do about the mess it has left but i submit that we shut off the jobs magnet and we end birthright citizenship another interesting little anecdote down in that same hospital was a mexican national who was pregnant with multiple births they took care of her prenatal care out of the hospital in tucson and they also set up the provider in mexico so that they could have the equipment to arrange for and give her good care for multiple births instead she waited until she went into labor waited close to the border came into the united states went into the hospital in tucson and delivered five children there to the tune of six figures times x those children all have birthright citizenship they all have now the right and the ability to bring in by chain migration their extended family members who knows what that costs mr speaker our compassion knows no bounds i understand neither do the borders of

helicopter experienced inflight engine failures at a rates of 329 mishaps per 1 000 hours of flight all of these issues are putting our men and women in uniform in grave danger and jeopardizing our

considerable the coast guard commandant calls it a readiness gap or downward readiness spiral whatever we call it the fact remains without new and betterequipped assets promised under deepwater the coast guard will not be able to successfully conduct its homeland security and other vital missions delaying deepwater is bad for homeland security it is also bad news for the budget continuing to

wing boxes on several of the c130s or the 63 million in other unfunded legacy sustainment priorities in order to control costs we need to invest in replacement assets the new deepwater assets will cost much less to maintain and will operate with fewer servicemembers saving millions in operating expenses and helping our homeland security mission deepwater will allow the service to push out the

issuing regulations and revising materials and publications for policyholders regarding insurance coverage in standard flood insurance policies this issue hits very close to home for me and several members of the house on september 18 2003 hurricane isabel made landfall at the outer banks of north carolina as a category 2 hurricane over the next 24 hours the hurricane moved across southern virginia into western pennsylvania and maryland the storm surge in the chesapeake bay area surrounding baltimore was 6 to 8 feet above normal levels even though isabel was only a category 2 when making landfall the hurricane was directly or indirectly responsible for 50 deaths including 7 in maryland the hurricane caused approximately 410 million in insured property damage in maryland alone with the number even higher when including uninsured property damage in my district alone several hundred of my constituents lost their homes and everything they owned due to the flooding people who lost everything have to pick themselves up and try to rebuild if they can many hurricane victims thought they had the right insurance and were covered for these losses they were wrong hundreds who thought they were covered discovered that they did not have the proper coverage they thought they understood their policies and what they were covered for they did not it was the technical nature of the policy documents and materials that were provided to these people that led to their confusion my amendment seeks to remedy this situation so that in the future flood insurance policyholders will have a better understanding of what exactly their policy covers we need to do that we need to do what we can to make it crystal clear to policyholders what they are signing up for my amendment will not rebuild houses or levees but it is my hope that this amendment will help people better understand their policies and the national flood insurance program so they are better prepared in the future

commend my good friend the gentleman from california for his strong and powerful statement i particularly want to thank the gentleman from illinois the distinguished chairman of the committee on international relations my good friend for leading us on this issue i just returned from a very substantive mission to north korea china and taiwan where i met with many of the key leaders of those countries our nations security interests in the asiapacific region including the national and economic security of our friends and allies in the asiapacific area were paramount on my agenda while the asiapacific region remains calm at the moment compared to other parts of the world this calm can be deceiving the united states has tens of thousands of troops deployed in asia and their security is directly threatened by the shortsighted and greeddriven initiative emanating from europe this initiative is the european unions current effort to lift its ban on arms sales to the peoples republic of china i therefore commend the gentleman from illinois the chairman of our full committee for introducing this important resolution and for moving it forward so expeditiously it is frightening to contemplate that american armed forces may one day be deployed in the taiwan strait to defend the island nation for a possible invasion by mainland china and if key leaders in paris berlin and brussels have their way our soldiers may very well be facing the latest in hightech weaponry manufactured by our allies in europe basedupon my recent meetings in china and taiwan i remain optimistic that tensions across the taiwan strait can be resolved peacefully and that the united states will not be drawn into taiwanrelated conflict key policymakers in beijing fully understand that military action against taiwan would spark international isolation possible military conflict with the united states and a certain boycott of the muchprized 2008 olympics in beijing taiwans leaders for their part fully understand that the increasing economic ties between taiwan and the mainland would be threatened by provocative steps president chen and vice president lu in taiwan fully understand that taiwan must negotiate with the mainland froth a position of strength which requires immediate approval by taiwans legislature of a supplemental defense package despite these factors working in favor of peace across the taiwan strait it is possible that mainland hardliners might push for military action against taiwan after the 2008 olympics or that conflict in the strait may begin because of miscalculation by either side it is in this context that the european unions current deliberations on lifting its arms embargo on china are so outrageous with enormous loss of human life the united states liberated the nations of europe during world war ii including france and germany for the new generation of european leaders to turn their backs on american national security interests and consider opening up the floodgates of weapons sales to the peoples republic of china shows that they have truly lost their moral compass europes leaders have argued that they will continue to restrict most arms sales to beijing even if the ban is lifted i simply do not believe this assertion if there is money to be made in a troubled part of the world through arms sales key european arms manufacturers are the first through the door to make that sale the decision by the european union is not final and it is my strong hope that president bush and our new secretary of state condoleeza rice will make it a top priority to convince the european union to reverse this dangerous course sadly the key reason for the imposition of the arms embargo chinas horrendous human rights record remains unchanged more than 15 years after the massacre at tiananmen square 0i 1115 europes leaders must understand that there will be severe ramifications for the transatlantic relationship if they fail to do what is right and just if they fail to respect internationally recognized human rights and the national security interests of their historic liberator and their most important ally the

seems a strange thing to say on a bill as small as the bill to fund the congressional budget but i honestly believe because of the attachment of the proposal for the continuity of congress that this bill is by far the worst bill to come to the floor in this session of congress i believe that that continuity of representation provision attached to this bill is an assault on constitutional government i believe it is an assault on checks and balances it is an assault on the rule of law it is an invitation to oneman rule and dictatorship i think it is profoundly misguided profoundly misgotten and i think a profound disservice is done in not having months and months of hearings with constitutional scholarsbefore such a drastic proposal is brought before the house i think there is a very good reason that the senate has not taken it up it is because it is a turkey of a proposal it could leave us literally with 75 and 80 percent of the congressional districts in this country unrepresented in a time of crisis at a time of terrorist attack and unrepresented in the halls of congress and i think that is a bad way to do business what i would like to do now is to talk about another problem in this bill that is the congressional visitors center i really believe that the congressional visitors center has been mismanaged in such spectacular fashion that it is really sort of a metaphor for the way that the entire federal budget deficit has been mismanaged and let me explain what i mean this project originally started as a 95 million project to have a modest expansion of the capitol to give tourists an opportunity to come in and see a movie about what the congress was all about before they visited thb capitol but the security assault on this capitol and 9 11 has in my view been used as an excuse to expand this operation we have also had other efforts from the library of congress and other institutions to further expand this proposition and so as a result today this project is a 500 millionplus project it is more than a year behind schedule and i think it is wasting taxpayers money and wasting an opportunity that we had to provide muchneeded usable space for the congress at the same time what is happening out on the east front is that over 2 acres of underground spaqe is being added to the capitol some of that is being added for purposes of a visitors center and some of the other space is being added for the purpose of expanding space under control of the senate and the house to do their work we all know that this congress needs more working space in my view the number one need of the congress for working space is the need for additional rooms for conference committees between the senate and the house because most of our hearings especially on the committee on appropriations when i came here they were held behind closed doors the press was not in the public was not in so there was plenty of room for a few people to get behind closed doors and work out deals and that is not the way government is supposed to work today today when we have a conference committee the press has a right to be there we need our staffs there and the public has the right to be there too we have no real room in the capitol for that kind of facility this is an opportunity to create that kind of room instead what has happened instead the only appreciable room of any quality in the new house space is what is called the house hearing room but in plain language that room is really a media center that is going to be where the press focuses whenever there is a hearing in that room because it will have all of the creature comforts for the press that room will have ample room for one hearing one presentation and whoever runs the congress will be able to decide what subject it is that gets that attention if you are trying to hold another public hearing on another subject in the capitol you are going to be stuck in tiny rooms that are worthless in terms of public access when i visited the visitors center i asked the architect why with these vaulted ceilings that you have set aside for this hearing room why could you not simply reduce the height of those rooms and at least provide two rooms of approximately the same size so that we had enough overflow room for the committees to do our work and to have conference committees i have yet to get an answer from the architects office that is my problem my problem is that with all of this space being created much of it is not usable for the purpose that we need it used for then we come to the other portion of the addon which is the portion devoted to the visitors center originally that visitors center was supposed to have two media theaters so that the public could come in see a short film about the congress and then be on its way here is the problem we have those two small orientation theaters but in addition to that we have this huge congressional auditorium which is going to seat 450plus people i asked the architect and this is a vaulted theater i asked why do we need another theater in the capitol what i was told by the architect is well you can bring in large constituency groups i would like to know how many members of the house have ever brought 500 people into the capitol i do not think there are going to be many people would raise their hands the second thing the architect told me is that well we need a place for where the house of representatives can meet when the house chamber is being remodeled e 1615 that i found a might strange because we have just redecorated the committee on ways and means room in the longworth building that room was originally created to serve as an alternative meeting place for the house of representatives when we had to repair this chamber so we have already got a spare room in addition we have another spare room i cannot talk about because it i classified but it is being built off campus somewhere so in essence we will have three spare rooms i do not know how much the offcampus room is costing the taxpayers or how much the committee on ways and means room cost the taxpayers but this room is going to cost a bundle i keep asking what is the real purpose for this room you finally go back 10 years and look at the original plans what do we find out we find out that this was originally included in the plans at the request of the library of congress because they wanted another theater to show movies and give presentations that might be nice for them to have but this project is already 400 percent over original cost i do not think it makes any sense i think this is the last chance that we are going to have to reconfigure this center so we have some additional working space instead of the taj mahal show space we are going to have another thing i do not like we have been told we are likely to have three congressional seals in the new visitors center those seals i have been told will cost up to a million bucks does any member really want to take the political heat when taxpayers find out that somebody is talking about spending 1 million on three congressional seals do members remember the cain that was raised when marble floors were put in four of our elevators in the capitol does anybody have any memory i would like to think so but i guess not i consider myself to be an institutional man i usually support this piece of legislation but out of frustration i am not going to support it today because i think this capitol visitors center when it is finally built is going to draw fliesin terms of bad stories about waste of taxpayer money misuse of space and we are going to wind up not having enough room for the principal function of government if this is indeed supposed to be a working capitol then we ought to be able to do better than this floor plan i really believe this package has been brought to us by staff who do not really understand how committees work and do not really understand the principal needs of this institution this is the last time we are going to have a chance to repair this package and make it more usable for the 100 years at least that it will be used i urge members to vote against this bill so we can start over i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
