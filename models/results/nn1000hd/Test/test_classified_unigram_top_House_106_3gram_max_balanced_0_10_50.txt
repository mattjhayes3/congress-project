asked by people why do you continue to come back and talk about the same subject well i do that because the american people have made it quite clear in poll after poll and focus group after focus group that education is their number one priority no matter how we approach it and i know abc has now a series on it because of the fact that they have recognized and want to pay tribute to the fact that continually the american people say education and the problems related to education should receive the highest priority when it comes to government assistance and the attention of our decisionmakers in the nation a poll was recently taken for the state of ohio and it came up 90 percent of the people said education is the number one priority no matter how we approach the problem in this democracy the people speak with one voice that they understand what the most important priority is what is amazing what i cannot comprehend is why in this democracy elected officials do not respond to that clearlydesignated priority how many times do the american people have to say it how many ways do they have to say it well there are some people who say we are responding to the priority and i want to talk about that mistaken assumption i think that there is a lot of activity a lot of rhetoric related to education as a result of understanding that the general public the overwhelming majority of the american people want some action of great significance on education instead of acting there is a lot of rhetoric there is a lot of posturing i think we might call education the most trivialized priority in the history of political dialogue in this country education is the most trivialized priority that is the response of a collective elected official community too many of our elected officials are like the group of whales that were documented recently there was a documentary where a group of whales were filmed beneath the ocean tossing a bloody baby seal around as sort of a game i suppose eventually they ate the seal but they tossed it around for a long time and played with it when we look at what is happening with education the political functionaries who have the power to do something of great significance the governors the mayors the congressmen the white house everybody seems to be willing to toss the bloody baby seal instead of dealing with the problem now there are some of these whales and whales come in many species some whales are truly without vision they do not understand how to deal with the problem some whales do not care they understand the problem they do not care about the public school system public education in america is like a baby seal bleeding and they do not care whether it bleeds to death or not they do not care how long they play with it they really do not intend to do anything about it then there are some other whales that are too cautious too frightened they understand the problem but they do not dareventure out and talk about a real solution to the problem so the bleeding baby seal keeps dying and we keep tossing him about but nothing is happening of great significance the public school system needs to be saved we need to do it with some kind of activity comparable to the kind of activity exhibited by thomas jefferson when he decided he would purchase a territory which was larger than the united states at that time it was a big significant action or when they decided to build the transcontinental railroad the transcontinental railroad was built not by private industry as most people think it was built by the government subsidy the government hired private companies to do it but the money came from the taxpayers the initiative came from the government the transcontinental railroad which linked the east and the west coast was a monumental undertaking the morrill act the morrill act which established land grant colleges in every state it took morrill a long time to get the idea across but finally he did that was a huge undertaking which transformed the american education system in very important ways especially it gave to the agricultural industry a scientific engineering base that has made agriculture in america something that no other nation has ever been able to get close to agricultural production in america we have undertaken the marshall plan the marshall plan was no small trivialized step toward the rebuilding of europe it took billions of dollars if we look at the marshall plan dollars in terms of todays dollars it was fantastic somebody could have been sitting in the corner saying look we cannot solve the problem of the revitalization of the european economies by throwing money at it let us not do it europe would have probably gone communist in a few years if they had not moved in a dramatic fashion with an overwhelming amount of aid so we know how it is done there is an american way of approaching the problem if we really want to solve it but when it comes to education we seem to think that the american public will soon get tired there is no issue there is no phenomenon which maintains and holds onto the attention of the american public indefinitely there is always the hope that it will go away that the concern will cease i hope not that is why i make the trip here as often as i can to remind the voters that they are right and the elected officials and their failure to respond places them in a situation where they are wrong the american people are right the american voters they are right their common sense is on target do not give up do not stop demanding at the focus groups when they call you on the phone keep saying we want government to provide some significant assistance to education we want to go on in some overwhelming way and deal with the problem instead of playing games with it there are a lot of things that are happening in the area of education which we have to look at it is such a complex problem until like the blind men feeling the elephant you can get a part of it and tell the truth if you feel the trunk you may describe the elephant one way if you feel the tail you describe him another way it is a complex problem education i do not want to belittle any aspect of the problem they all deserve attention we have to deal with reading we have to deal with science laboratories we have to deal with libraries we have to deal with certification of teachers we have to deal with standards testing and most of all we need to deal with what i call the opportunities to learn we have had some great strides in the establishment of new curriculum standards we have had some great strides in the area of testing it is the area of opportunities to learn which seems to be the area where we lose vision and that is the most important area of all the opportunity to learn involves what are you going to do the question is what are you going to do to make certain that the students in the schools have what they need to deal with the curriculum that we have established and to be able to pass the tests that we are establishing i have served on the committee on education and labor and what is called now the committee on education and the workforce i have served on that for the entire time i have been in congress on the occasion of the reauthorization of the elementary and secondary education assistance act 5 years ago we had a great debate about this whole matter of establishing curriculum standards and establishing testing standards we were in the case of a group of democrats on the committee afraid that if you established curriculum standards that are national although states have the freedom to deal with their own standards but they do not have to be dragged into it but if you established models that are replicated state by state and then you established the testing standards and that became some national testing standards that were going to be used all over the country if you did all of that there is a danger that you could ruin the lives of youngsters by having these highstakes tests circulating all over and determining who gets pigeon holed for the time that they are in school and college or for determining their ability to get a job there were a number of reasons why we were afraid of testing but those of us who were afraid of a national testing policy to accompany a national set of curriculum standards agreed that we would accept national testing standards and national curriculum standards if you also had a national opportunity to learn standards opportunity to learn standards was the third set of standards we called it a troika for education reform and after many weeks of debate finally we got that passed into the legislation it was added to the legislation of course democrats were in control of the house at the time we had the majority and we were able to prevail and the opportunities to learn standards are included with the curriculum standards and the testing standards the problem now is that our schools are not going forward we are not getting results because we have eliminated a part of the troika actually in a backroom deal the committee on appropriations which had no authority to do it but all parties agreed the administration agreed both parties agreed they took out the opportunity to learn standards and we are zooming forward with the curriculum standards and with the testing standards every state every local education agency is now dealing with ways to tell the students that you have to measure up to certain standards the curriculum is going to be tougher but what the states and local education agencies are not willing to deal with is we are also going to provide you with the opportunities to learn that what you need we are going to provide you with whatever you need in order to be able to measure up to these standards pass the tests we are going to provide you with decent buildings decent libraries we are going to provide you with laboratories we are going to provide you with necessary books we are going to provideyou with teachers who are able to teach what they are assigned to teach in the classrooms certified competent teachers those are the things we backed away from in new york you have a new set of tests all students have to pass certain regents tests otherwise they do not get any type of paper there was a time when you get what you call a general diploma which said you were sitting in the seats when you were in high school and you attended you met certain minimal standards so here is a general high school diploma that is being eliminated you have to pass certain tests i have no problem with the tests i have no problem with the curriculum standards if only we can add some opportunity to learn standards we do not want children who have to sit in classrooms that are still threatened with asbestos we do not want children to have to sit in classrooms that have the pollution from coalburning furnaces we do not want children who have to sit in overcrowded classrooms where there are too many in there we do not want children who have to eat lunch at 10 00 in the morning because the school has twice as many students as it was built for in order to cycle them through the lunchroom you have to have three different lunch periods or four different lunch periods the first lunch period has to begin at 10 00 the last one ends at 1 30 or 2 00 so the children who eat last are very hungry excessively and the children who eat first are being force fed after they have already had breakfast we do not want these atrocities to go on you have to deal with opportunities to learn by guaranteeing the right kinds of facilities and the right kinds of materials and conditions if you take new york as a case study and i think that whenever i talk about new york i later on get comments that are emailed or faxed or come over the telephone where people indicate that it is not unique to new york you have got similar problems in many other places there are other places where children have to eat lunch at 10 00 in the morning i found out there are numerous places where the overcrowding has reached a point where it is almost impossible to conduct classes even after the trailers are added and the kids have to walk through the snow to get to the restroom from the trailers or even after you add trailers in order to bring down the class size the conditions still continue to be detrimental to learning it is not just new york it is not just big cities the reason we keep getting the polls wh ph show that the american people want education to be treated seriously as a high priority item from all over the country is because the situation does exist in most parts of the country but new york is a good case study whatever i discuss with respect to new york is applicable elsewhere in the country i got a letter from some people who were working very hard in new york about some of the comments that i have made previously in essence a very respected retired judge thomas russell jones who is a retired judge who works very hard to try to improve education he is the president of an organization that he and his wife established called the childrens times the childrens times continues to work away at the problems to carry my analogy of the ocean a little further they are not whales tossing a bloody baby seal they are people who desperately at the bottom of the sea are searching for pearls polishing those pearls and trying to in every small way do something significant to help improve education i applaud all of the efforts no matter how small they are to try to come to grips with problems related to our educational system i dont mean to say that those people are not serious i am talking about public officials with power members of congress governors mayors people with power are the whales who are playing with the bloody seal we can do far more and i suppose what judge jones was saying to me is that he would like to see me stop talking so much and do more i agree with the judges comments in the letter he wrote he says of my october speech he criticizes me for not proposing any real solutions he must not have listened to the very end because i always propose solutions the solutions that i propose are not small ones however they are not nickel and dime solutions they are solutions that are worthy of government action certainly federal government action but i will just quote a little from judge jones letter november 3 1999 co dear congressman owens your october 12 speech to the house of representatives as the designee of the democratic minority informs the american people about a number of problems with education you informus that 81 percent of the american people favor placing computers in the classrooms of all public schools you inform us that students in our country are going to have to seek jobs in a world where if one cannot use computers and use them effectively there is little hope for them to make a decent living you have said that quote black parents do not have any faith left in the public school system they have given up hope the childrens times directors agree with your findings and conclusions we congratulate you for focusing attention on the fndingsof the washington post poll released on september 5 1999 which reports that the american people place the immediate improvement of public schools at the top of their agenda year after year your statement however does not present any concrete practical proposals to guarantee a modern education to 1 1 million children who attend public schools in new york city the childrens times petitions you to address the critical deficiencies in the elementary schools of new york city with respect of computer equipment in the classrooms and th6 effective closing of libraries in all public schools i respectively request that you publicly endorse the statement of united states senator edward kennedy of massachusetts delivered to the unitedstates senate on july 29 where he reported that the teacher shortage has forced many school districts to hire uncertified teachers or ask certified teachers to teach outside their area of expertise each year more than 50 000 underprepared teachers enter the classrooms one in four new teachers do not meet standard certiflcation requirements twelve percent of new teachers have had no teacher training students in ifner city schools have only a 50 percent chance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher i agree with all of these observations by judge jones and his son david jones who as the head of the community service society some years ago was responsible for a survey which showed that in twothirds of the schools in the city those schools that were serving hispanic and african american children practically all the teachers who were teaching science and math had not majored in math and science in college so judge jones you have laid out several different aspects of the problem i will not belittle any of them everything that you point out is correct i applaud the childrens times for staying on the dase but listen carefully i do propose solutions i propose solutions at all levels on several previous occasions i said that new york city had part of the solution to the problem in its hands new york city had a 2 billion surplus last year their budget had 2 billion left over after they met all city obligations and the city could have moved to begin to deal with some of these problems without federal assistance new york state had a 2 billion surplus last year and new york state not only did not do anything about the problem when the state assembly and the state senate finally reached agreement that they would appropriate 500 million of that 2 billion for school repairs the governor of the state vetoed that part of the budget he would not use 500 million out of the 2 billion for school repairs all across the state so these problems deserve attention and i am a member of congress and am here to represent my constituency at the federal level the federal government must lead the way because that is where most of the money is all taxes are local all the money in washington came from the local level and we should not flinch or hesitate to send some of that money back to deal with basic problems like the public school system i also received a letter from mrs jones bertha jones judge joness wife who is a secretary of the childrens times at a later date and she is talking about our libraries the childrens times associates has launched a campaign to ree stablish functioning libraries in the elementary schools of the city of new york the facts the new york state department of education division of library development the state agency which supervises public school libraries throughout the state informed the childrens times associates by a written memorandum dated august 23 1999 that 550 elementary schools out of a total of 672 schools report a shortage of 550 certified librarians the memorandum adds that many public school libraries are presently staffed by teachers who have no library or technological training or by paraprofessionals who lack expertise of any kind i would not say paraprofessionals lack expertise of any kind but certainly they are not qualified to run school libraries the united states department of education statistics reported recently that the new york city school system has hired fewer than one library media specialist for every 1 042 students library media specialists are trained to provide local media and telecommunications materials and access to experts whose advice and instructions teach children how to prepare classwork and homework on their own the childrens times associates predict that if children do not learn to read and do basic arithmetic by the fourth grade they will be playing a losing game of catchup for the rest of their academic lives which may not be very long when libraries are reestablished in all elementary schools in new york city under the supervision of library media specialists in compliance with the new york state education law and the commissioners regulations 533 695 students will have access to the instructions and technology they need to work for their livelihoods as adults in 2000 and beyond and that is signed by bertha jones the secretary of the childrens times associates again as a former public librarian my profession is library science i have a masters degree in library science i wholeheartedly agree that this is a very devastating report of a blind spot in the publicschool system libraries have always had to fight to exist in elementary schools it looks as if we are losing that battle in new york city nothing is more important than what goes on with respect to libraries and the processes that children learn there about how to learn on their own how to use the great fountain of knowledge that exists to take care of their own needs and to facilitate ways to educate themselves nothing is more important than encouraging youngsters also to do as much reading as possible i wholeheartedly agree with mrs jones i talk a lot about computers i talk a lot about the need to bring our students to the level where they can run a cyber civilization where they can deal with the fact that the world is now being more and more digitalized it is not computer literacy it is computer competence the ability to work with imagination dealing with computers and web sites and the whole telecommunications revolution requires very well educated people i have talked a great deal about that but do not misunderstand me i know that begins with reading nobody learns how to deal with the information technology if they do not know how to read if they do not know basic arithmetic it all begins with the basics and i do not want to ever appear to have down played that in response to the childrens times crusade to provide libraries for the schools in new york city let me say that i have joined with my colleague in the senate jack reed and senator jack reed was a member of the committee on education and the workforce when we passed the last elementary and secondary assistance act and we placed in that act the opportunity to learn standards so he knows very well that one of the things we have to do if we are going to improve education in america is to go beyond curriculum standards go beyond national testing and deal with providing opportunities to learn so senator reed has already introduced a bill and i have introduced the same bill companion piece october 4 a few weeks ago which provides for amending the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 to provide uptodate school library media resources and welltrained professionally certified school library specialists for elementary schools and secondary schools and for other purposes this bills number is h r 3008 h r 3008 in the house the companion senate bill is s 1262 now i have just recently put out a dear colleague letter asking all of my colleagues to join me on this particular piece of legislation going beyond the statistics which mrs jones cited for newyork city let us talk about the whole country looking at libraries in the whole country we are talking about almost onethird of the unitedstates public schools lack a fulltime school library media specialist the national average is one library media specialist to every 591 students in american elementary and secondary schools the ratio of students to school library media specialists varies widely from one school library specialist for every 287 public school students in montana to one library media specialist for every 942 public school students in california a 12state unitedstates study found that funding for school library materials annually vary from 15 to 58 874 for elementary school libraries and 155 to 100 810 for secondary school libraries in other words the funding for some elementary school libraries as low as 15 for others for some high school libraries as low as 155 this funding for school library materials but in some schools it was as high as 5 874 in some elementary schools and as high as 100 810 in some secondary schools so the disparity is obviously there it is one of the problems which the federal role in education has always sought to address the great disparity between the richest districts and the poorest districts reading further in terms of the findings that make this school library bill important the median per pupil expenditure by school library media centers in america in the 19951996 school year was 6 73 for elementary schools the per pupil expenditure the median was 6 73 for elementary schools that is all and 7 30 for middle schools 6 25 for senior high schools in a nation which is enjoying unprecedented prosperity we can do better i will not read further from this dear colleague letter but i include for the record as follows"], [9.739398956298828e-05, 0.999902606010437, 1, "i thank the leadership for allowing me time to address an issue which is very very important the nation has certainly understood the gravity of the problem of drugs within our communities within our states and throughout the whole country it is a problem that i certainly have recognized in my years of service to this congress as well as in the local community but i think like most citizens i have more or less assumed that this was a problem that individuals like ourselves could not deal with in any effective way that we had to rely upon our law enforcement agencies our federal bureau of investigation our dea agents and the justice department and in some instances the state department to come to grips with this very very critical and persuasive problem not until this year at the beginning of the 106th congress did i come face to face with the reality that i did indeed as one member of this congress have a great responsibility for the development of the policy and the course of action and the emphasis and the direction that we would take with regard to the drug problem within our united states i left the 6year term left service of the committee on the budget in the house of representatives and returned back to my committee previously known as the committee on government operations now known as the committee on government reform and found myself being named the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources under that jurisdiction it became my responsibility not only to formulate human resource policies and directions and oversight but to take a very critical look with the rest of my subcommittee on the overall problems of drug usage within the united states first an immediate responsibility came in being invited to join the chairman of the subcommittee on an extensive field trip through el salvador panama peru bolivia and on through mexico in order to investigate the whole problem of the trafficking of these narcotic drugs into the united states it was a very interesting field trip and i learned a great deal i learned where the drugs were coming from where they are being produced how they were entering into the traffic by sea and by air and over the land and to some extent what the individual countries were doing with respect to this whole traffic issue some countries i felt had done a great deal peru in fact was probably the outstanding example of where a changeover in national leadership made all the difference in the world in terms of their being able to handle the traffic that was flowing through their country into the united states colombia was another place that we visited and met with the president of that country and learned from them the monumental steps that that country had taken of interest in colombia is in fact that several years ago colombia had been decertified because the leadership of the congress felt that their efforts to try to curb the traffic and to do something about the offenders and all of the drug lords was minimal at least and so the decision under the wishes of the congress at that time was to decertify that country in order to emphasize the fact that the united states felt they could do more in fact the consequence was that that country did more and did a very aggressive job in arresting and curbing the traffic from colombia to this country so they have now come back into a cooperative venture with the united states in trying to help us deal with the problem the issue therefore that the congress now faces is that every march 1 the president of the united states must make a recommendation to the congress as to whether all of the countries with whom we have relationships should be certified in terms of their enactment pursuit administration and enforcement of a drug policy which helps the united states to deal with the traffic coming from that particular country the big debate this year as has been in the past is whether mexico should be decertified or not and we visited mexico we spent 3 days there discussing the matter with their leadership and trying to understand what in fact that nation was doing in terms of curbing not only production and the harvesting and the growing of these various drug producing plants but also what they were doing in the criminal enforcement area in picking up these narcotraffickers and putting them in prison and enforcing their own national laws irrespective of our laws which many of them had also violated and for whom outstanding arrest warrants had been issued without any particular results so we are now back here in the congress and one of the major issues that we have to decide and debate is what to do about mexico and the question before the congress is whether in our opinion the country of mexico has done enough has maintained a substantial pressure within all the criminal elements in their country that has created this enormous traffic of drugs flowing from mexico to the united states it is a very difficult issue because as we debate the issue of decertifying we are questioning their sovereignty we are in fact intervening in internal politics but i think it is important to remember that this crisis situation within the united states is something of deep concern to the people of the united states and while it attempts it appears to be invasive of another countrys internal policies what we must come to grips with is that these internal policies of our neighbors have a very very deep repercussion on our own national wellbeing the safety of our children and our families and of our own ability to deal with these criminal activities within the united states having said that i have come to the conclusion that the steps that mexico has taken the level of cooperation that they have exhibited their leadership having been expressed in many ways including funding and including collaborative efforts with the united states indicated a deep deep abiding will to help themselves in their country of mexico as well as the united states to bring an end to this very very terrible miserable criminal element in their society they have some very profound problems of internal corruption of a takeover of major portions of their country and enormous instability in parts of their nation that contribute to their problem and exacerbate their difficulties but i believe very strongly that if we are to do anything about this supply coming in from mexico we need the continued cooperation of the mexican government and i believe that they have cooperated the problem still exists and in some ways perhaps they have become greater in some areas but i do feel the cooperation the will to help us is there we just need to maintain the connection and keep insisting on progress looking at this whole drug problem within the united states surveying it from the traffic element it has certainly brought to my focus the element that it is not only the supply coming into the united states which is of crisis proportions it is our own inability within the united states to come to grips with the criminal element which is within our own cities within our own states within our own border we are told by high placed dea officials that the connection between the supply in mexico and those who are harvesting billions of dollars within our cities plaguing upon our families and our children are right in our midst operating within our cities and within our states i feel if we are going to make an exhausting demand and inquiry as to what the mexican government is doing in their own country it is equally important that we make that same sort of inquiry with respect to our own law enforcement agencies and to look to the people who are controlling the purse strings here in the congress to make sure that the budgets that we are providing our law enforcement agencies is adequate the problem is very very grave indeed we have something like 14 000 druginduced deaths every year in america some half a million emergency visits to our hospitals and clinics all derived from drugrelated incidents this is a very major problem affecting at least one out of ten of our american families who have someone that we love dear to us involved in this particular problem it is a problem that is not only disturbing but is something that we cannot ignore we have a report that is produced by the office of national drug control policy there are volumes i brought to the floor with me today the executive summary this is the national drug control strategy for 1999 it is in your libraries i commend all of you interested in this issue to get a hold of the report and try to understand the enormity of the problem the major thrust of the national office is to look to ways in which we can reduce the demand that means education that means working with the young people this means treatment and all sorts of preventive measures and i think that those are very very important and i know that there are many many agencies local state and federal that are engaged in that effort the national budget is somewhere around 17 billion to help us reduce the demand if we did not have a demand within this country no amount of trafficking would make this issue into a major problem so they are right in talking about reduction of demand we are right in talking about the necessity of reducing these huge supplies coming across our borders from other countries those two issues are important but equally important as i see it is the ability of our local enforcement officers together with our federal authorities to make a much bigger effort to arrest locate through hightech purposes or whatever these individuals who are trafficking these drugs in our cities throughout america and i do not believe that enough effort is being made i was recently visited by a student from my district who said he reported to a local police officer that on a certain corner in his community he was sure that this individual was trafficking in drugs and the police officer or no one else has followed up on that and i believe that that situation is indicative of fear reluctance inhibitions intimidations or whatever that exist in our societies that prevent us from being tough on the law enforcement area lets take a look at the realities of our drug problem within the united states here is a chart that indicates that americans spend 57 billion on illegal drugs each year it shows the amount that is spent on cocaine which is the largest column on the right and a much smaller expenditure wasted on heroin and a smaller amount on marijuana and others this indicates the monies going down the drain on an entirely abusive illegal nonfunctioning harmful activity within the united states we worry about where our resources are going here is where a lot of the monies are going and we need to stop this waste look at the loss of human life drugrelated deaths are increasing every year almost 10 000 drugrelated deaths this is not including all of the nondirect what they call other related deaths waste of human life as a result of drug consumption in our communities our jails are being filled with people that have drugrelated offenses something like 1 5 million total arrests either in the possession sale or manufacturing of illegal drugs we have something like 1 8 million persons in our prisons today and those represent over a million in state prisons at the cost of something like 25 billion to our states we have about 100 000 in federal prisons at the cost of 3 billion and another half a million in our local jails at the cost of 11 billion and when you add up the prison expenditure it is almost 40 billion added to what i already showed in the chart of what is being spent on the purchase of these drugs the rate of incarceration is the second highest in the entire world per capita russia is the only other country that surpasses us in the number of persons that we have behind bars today and of the 1 8 million this report advises that 1 5 million are related in some way to a drug offense either they were drug users or they were drug offenders in particular so our prisons are bursting at their seams we are arresting people who are using and selling these commodities on our streets but what i officially believe is that we have not gone after the major traffickers in our cities and this is what we need to pursue the dea tells me that they know who these people are that in many cases they have issued warrants for their arrests but they have fled and they are not able to be found i believe that these individuals names pictures identifications should be posted all over america so that everyone will know who these individuals are we talk about the mexican traffickers and these drug lords that are running the traffic in mexico itself but the dea tells us in their testimony before our committees that these people in mexico are linked up to the distributors who operate within our cities so while we are very outraged at the fact that the warrants that we have issued for the arrest of people that are in mexico have not ended up in their conviction and brought to trial within the united states because of various technicalities on how to extradite how the appeal process is extremely slow in point of fact there are tens of thousands of these operatives linked up to the gangs that exist in mexico who now operate within the united states so i believe what this should tell us what this should instruct us is a stronger much more determined commitment on the part of the united states to do something about these individuals that are already operating within the united states this is a statistic that i have already given you about the percentage of federal prisoners who were sentenced because of drug offenses there is no doubt that the problem within the united states is a major one insofar as our prison population is concerned and that gives you an idea of the relationship of criminal activity to a drugabuse situation the marijuana arrests within the united states is also an interesting statistic in 1998 this report tells us that 12 percent of the eighth graders in all of our schools in this country were users of marijuana in the 10th grade it rose to 21 percent in the 12th grade it rose to 25 6 percent this is a very very high proportion a lot of people wink or blink or just look the other way when we talk about marijuana on the assumption that it is not a serious matter it is an extremely serious matter because the studies prove that there is a very high correlation between marijuana use and serious behavior problems in the schools including cutting class low scores in their academic studies physical violence against teachers and their schoolmates and outright theft and destruction of property so there is an antisocial behavior problem with those of our youngsters who are using marijuana at such early ages and so we have to worry about this whole concept of marijuana use each year about 60 000 of our youngsters in our elementary and secondary schools are arrested on varying degrees of marijuana offenses we have a very very disturbing problem there that is affecting many thousands of our young people and their families the report also tells us that overall throughout the whole country there are more than 4 million chronic users of one or more of the drugs that i had listed this is a very very serious problem these are chronic users 4 million about 14 million are current users they may not become chronic abusers but they are current users of one of these various drugs and so it is a dimension of a problem that cannot be dismissed in terms of our social and political agenda the national office has listed five goals as i said earlier first to educate our young people second to reduce drugrelated crimes third to reduce the socialeconomic costs of illegal drug use fourth to shield our frontiers to close the borders so that the supply does not come forward and fifth to do something about our domestic sources this is an issue that i think we can do something about let us take marijuana as an example there are currently 11 million users of marijuana much of the marijuana that is being abused in this country is produced in this country we cannot point a finger at another country and say they are the culprits shut off their supply and this problem will go away it will not because a good deal of marijuana is raised within this country california my own state of hawaii kentucky west virginia and tennessee are listed in this report as major growing states of marijuana and while all attention is put on mexico because of the decertification problem the report also cautions us that another growing major supplier of marijuana is canada and so maybe we should look to canada also as a country that needs to have a drug policy that we could examine heroin has about 800 000 chronic users the purity of heroin is an issue because as it becomes more and more pure which is the phenomenon we are experiencing now it allows it to be smoked or snorted rather than injected as a consequence the use of it is expanding rather than contracting the increases are quite significant in 1996 there were an estimated 200 000 heroin chronic users today there are 325 000 users and so the numbers are increasing quite dramatically the other drug abuse in this country which is causing great alarm because of its highly addictive qualities is a drug known as methamphetamine or in some cases with crystal methamphetamines it is referred to as ice meth can be manufactured in a bathtub we refer to them as laboratories but really they are not complicated places where the drug is manufactured it just could be in somebodys kitchen a great deal of it is manufactured within the united states this is a drug that is not dependent upon being trafficked across the borders from somewhere it is being produced and manufactured right within our own communities predominantly in the west it is highly toxic so if you think that this is a problem only with the producers of meth and the consumers think again because when this stuff is put into the sewer and drains out of the bathtub it goes into the environment and it is becoming a very very serious toxic dangerous highly polluting commodity communities are becoming quite alarmed because they have ways to detect its disposal in our sewage system meth is produced primarily in the west consumed primarily in the west and we have very very large indications of its use in one statistic that i saw 52 percent of all persons arrested in san jose were tested positive for having used methamphetamines here is an issue that we have to come to grips with the dea seized over 4 140 methamphetamine laboratories in the last 4 years in this 1998 period over 2 000 were seized and destroyed these meth operatives people who go out and sell it and dispose of it have connections with the mexican drug traders and so in that sense it is the same people that are selling the cocaine and the heroin and so forth are also dispersing the methamphetamines this is a new aspect of a problem that is growing and causing tremendous concern we have many many other issues in terms of our working relationship with mexico we have various bilateral agreements it is indicative to me at least as an observer in our discussions and in reading all the various materials that i have seen that the leadership of mexico president zedillo and others his attorney general and other individuals that we spoke with have a very firm commitment and a will to do something about it it is as though one could lookat our own law enforcement considerations within the united states and ask the question are we doing enough i would have to answer no i do not believe we are that is the same question we put to the mexican government are they doing enough and my answer there would be also no i do not believe they are doing enough but i certainly do not believe that mexico should be decertified and cut off from any potential agreements or collaboration or cooperation or joint efforts to try to do something about the supply of these drugs coming across the border this is certainly a very very critical problem we have the opportunity to debate it and discuss it i am not sure whether it will come up in a legislative matter there have been bills that have been introduced calling for decertification i hope the congress does not take that step but neither should the problem be dismissed as something that simply comes up once a year and that the country is asked to engage upon it only once in 12 months this is an issue which is serious it is pervasive it is destroying tens of thousands of lives within the united states it is making it impossible for young people to develop as normal human beings because their lives have been interjected and contaminated and abused by drugs so i feel that while we are taking this issue of the international responsibilities that our neighbors have with respect to this issue and the complicity that their nonperformance or noncooperation may have to the exacerbation of our own problem within the united states we cannot any longer dismiss our responsibility to make sure that everything possible is being done we certainly have the experts we certainly have the science we have the technology we have all the means by which to detect the movement of individuals money and the drugs so i would like to see a much more heavily engaged much more largely financed operation of people within the dea and within the justice department helping us to interdict these criminals within our community they have a long list they tell me thousands of these traffickers have been arrested but so many of them have not been brought to justice so they are out there still lurking around our communities banking tens of billions of dollars in investments and creating this problem which we call money laundering because this money is illegal it is illicit it was made from the benefit of selling illegal products within the united states it has no business moving into the normal legal commerce of this nation or of any nation and so we need to take greater steps to interdict this money find out where it is where it is being deposited which banks and making sure that no benefits no profit no advance no monetary benefits are derived from this illegal traffic that is another area which i feel we need to engage the financial interests of this country when you go to mexico immediately the big american businesses will come to you and say you cant decertify mexico because billions of dollars of our american interests are involved in the trade between mexico and the united states i certainly will agree to that there are huge connections of involvement between american business and mexican business but i call upon the american businessmen here in this country as well as in mexico to join forces with the united states in making sure that every effort that they can pursue to help us interdict and arrest these individuals and bring them to justice be done so i like to look upon this decertification process as an opportunity for us to examine our policies to make sure that we are protecting our young people in the schools we are teaching them about the tremendous hazards of drug consumption and how addictive it is and how they must stay away from it we must do everything we can to prevent the adult population from engaging in this kind of activity we have to arrest the people who are on the street selling this stuff we have to also engage ourselves with the nearly 2 million people that are in our prisons to make sure that adequate treatment is available to them so that when they are released and they all will be released eventually can go back into society completely rid of any habits they might have had previously with regard to drug usage so we have an enormous problem but the most important it seems to me for our american communities is to make our streets safe so that while we are teaching our young people and have all these treatment and prevention programs in place it is not an easy thing to just walk to the street corner and pick up a gram or two of heroin or cocaine or buy marijuana or whatever it should not be something which is that easy to do in our communities i believe that law enforcement agencies need our support they need our commitment to make sure that these laws are abided by they need enough funds to make sure that enough people are in their agencies to make it possible for law enforcement activities to take place they need a lot of intelligence they need a lot of undercover agents to ferret out where these activities are taking place so we in the congress have a dual responsibility we have to make sure that adequate resources are being engaged to combat this problem within the united states because demand is an issue and if we can get our hands on an adequate control of the demand that comes from the united states to buy these terrible things then it seems to me we have an evenhanded policy with other countries by insisting that they shut off the supply as well d 1445 i shall pursue with great vigor and great enthusiasm and a great deal of interest my new responsibilities as the ranking member of this subcommittee i know that i have a great deal more to learn about the hazards of this problem but i am certainly prepared to engage myself and my staff on a full and complete examination of this issue before i leave the special order this afternoon i wanted to indicate that the president of the united states does not stand alone on his recommendation that mexico ought to continue its work and that we ought to join forces with them and cooperate with them and encourage them to fulfill their commitment to us and to their own people because their own people are suffering just as tragically from what i have described as our own internal problem the mexican people are also suffering so i have here a letter that was recently sent to the president of the united states mr clinton signed by the governor of texas george w bush the governor of arizona jane dee hull and the governor of new mexico gary e johnson urging the president on behalf of the states of arizona new mexico and texas that they convey their full support for the certification of mexico as a responsible ally in the international war against drugs the letter states we believe that under president zedillos leadership mexicos commitment to and cooperation in counter narcotics efforts has definitely improved and they support full certificafion of mexico i ask that this letter be incorporated at the end of my remarks the congress will be pursuing this matter of certification our subcommittee will be pursuing the overall national policies of drug control within the united states and i hope that the congress and the people of the united states can be engaged in a fair and thorough examination of our own internal domestic crisis and come up with a determination and a will to do much better than we are currently doing state of texas"],

and then talk about the new economy and how we can adopt our government to address the issues that it brings to the fore i was interested to hear for an hour the 2000 campaign is still a ways away and for any of those who are wondering whether or not it is going to be positive i guess the gentlemen who preceded me have answered that question in the negative it is going to be relentlessly negative amongst the charges that we heard tonight i understand now that vice president gore wants to get rid of ambulances and fire trucks if the other people are to be believed that is a core of his policy those who were not listening to the comments what they were saying is mr gore has concerns about the internal combustion engine and would like to replace it they implied that since these engines are now in ambulances and fire trucks for him to oppose the internal combustion engine must mean he wants to get rid of ambulances and fire trucks i think this sort of extreme negative campaigning is bad for our entire system of government i think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle many of their issues i actually agree with i think we can get up and talk about what we stand for and move the country forward instead of relentlessly trying to pummel whoever emerges as the leader of the party we are opposed to i do not think that serves democracy and i am somewhat saddened to see that as i said 20some months before the campaign even starts we are full bore on the ripping apart of the person who we think is going to lead the opposite party let us talk about a few positive issues what we stand for and the direction we want to take the country in towards that end that is what i want to talk about today i talk as a member of the new democratic caucus we try to each week as new democrats to present a message an issue that we want to talk about that we think the country needs to address and that our government needs to address new democrats are essentially moderate probusiness progrowth democrats within our caucus and the issue that i want to talk about today has to do with the new economy and how our government can institute policies that address the changes that that new economy brings to our country first of all i want to talk about what i mean by the new economy everyone has heard about the information age about the global economy it has almost become a cliche to say that we live in a global economy that is based far more on technology but just because it is a cliche does not make it any less true it is the dominant feature of the last few years of the 20th century and will be the dominant feature as we move into the 21st century as our economy changes we must adjust to it we must understand what moves and motivates this new economy and adopt the policies that adjust to those changes to best serve the people of this country it is a good news bad news situation the good news is it creates so much opportunity the advances that we have had in the technology from computers to telecommunications to all points in between to software have created tremendous amounts of choices and tremendous amounts of opportunities in a wide variety of fields it also creates challenges the central challenge that it creates is adjusting to change the world simply changes more rapidly today than it did previously therefore we have to be ready to make the adjustments as new technologies come on board as the world changes i am 100 percent confident that we can do this no question about it we can benefit from the dramatic increase in productivity in growth that high tech industries give us and adjust to the changes but not if we do not think about the issues in a new light think about what the information age what the global economy means to the policies that we need to adopt to strip this to its core what i am talking about is people the reason i care about technology issues is because of the district i represent the ninth district of the state of washington it is a blue collar district and one of the most important things that the leaders in our community whether they be government or business can do is ensure that a strong economy exists so that the people of districts like mine and throughout the country can get good jobs make enough money to take care of their family and pursue their dreams and their interests as they see fit maintaining that economy is what is going to bring it home to everybody not just the top 5 percent not just the bill gateses of the world but every single person in the country who needs to have a good job to support their family or just support themselves can benefit from policies that embrace the high tech new economy it is going to be important to real people from one end of this country to the other i think when we talk about the high tech new economy it is important to break it down there are really five areas of the new economy first of all we have computers and in that i include software and hardware we have the internet we have telecommunications biotech which is primarily health care products that are developed and lastly we have all of the products that those first four things help create i think there is a mistake sometimes that people make that technology is just a certain sector of our economy there are certain quote high unquote companies and then there are low tech companies every company is affected by technology obviously some are more affected by it intel cisco systems microsoft these are companies directly in high tech but even a company even a retail store that sells clothing apparel is affected by the quality of the software that they have that can track their inventory and track their customers and find out new opportunities one of the examples that i think shows this is a small company that is actually starting up in my district that is trying to develop coincidentally back to the internal combustion engine a new engine that will generate power i have not figured out a way to make it drive an automobile but what it can do is it can generate energy and replace some of the old methods of generating that energy the advantage of this new engine that is based on the ram jet physics stuff that i do not even begin to understand except to say that it works and it generates energy much more cleanly and much more efficiently than current methods the person who was able to generate this product had worked on the technology in the defense sector he had worked on it with jet airplanes but they had never quite made the connection down to the more civilian use of generating energy he was able to generate that because of the rapid advancing in computers and software that enabled him to test theories more rapidly stuff that would have taken decades to get through to test he could literally do in a matter of weeks and that enabled him to test theories and move forward and get to the point where he actually developed the engine in the biotech sphere i talked to some folks in the biotech industry just last week and they said from 1985 to today they have been able through the use of computers and software to reduce the time it takes them to analyze data to the point where a project that they did in the mid1980s took them 5 years to analyze that data today they could do in an afternoon this application spreads all across our economy so those five sectors need to be encouraged and fostered to grow because they impact all aspects of our business as we get into an increasingly competitive global economy we want our companies in the unitedstates to be the ones that advance fastest and furthest and do it first so that we can take the advantage and get the economic benefit of that for our country therefore we need to adopt policies that reflect this we need to look to the future and say as the world changes as technology moves forward what do we need to do to be ready for it certainly we cannot go with policies that we had 50 20 even 10 years ago when technology has changed remember 5 years ago the internet was pretty much a nonfactor it was an idea it was out there certainly but the explosive growth in the last five years was not foreseen but by the smallest number of people now that affects every aspect of our economy we need to be ready for those sorts of changes towards that end i have six main policy areas that i want to make people aware of that we in government need to address to try to adjust to this high tech economy the first one has to do with export controls and this is one that actually applies to more than just the high tech economy it just becomes more of a factor because of the global nature of our economy that the information age makes possible we have a number of policies in this country that restrict the exportation of our products specifically restrict the exportation of technology products or create unilateral economic sanctions against the export of all products this creates a problem for one simple fact andfor one simple reason ninetysix percent of the people of this world live someplace other than the united states yet the united states is currently responsible for 20 percent of the worlds consumption what that means is that if our companies are going to grow if markets are going to increase they are going to have to have access to markets outside of this country currently our policy on unilateral economic sanctions places sanctions on dozens of different countries that limit our ability to export now the reason we place those economic sanctions is because we disapprove of something that that country has done and that makes a certain amount of sense if our action to place those sanctions would change the action by that other country that we disapprove of but the reality is it does not all it means is they go someplace else to buy their products in essence what we are doing is we are punishing these other countries by telling them that we will not take their money and that is not much of a punishment it drives them into the arms of our competitors we need to rethink our unilateral economic sanctions policy multilateral sanctions make sense if we can get enough people together enough of our allies together to condemn an action condemn a country and place sanctions on them then that can work but taking the action unilaterally does nothing to advance the policy aims and only hurts us economically in the technology realm we place restrictions on the exportation of encryption technology that is technology that is used basically to protect data on a computer to make sure that people cannot access it who you do not want to access your information we also place restrictions on the exportation of socalled supercomputers the problem with that is because computers are leaping ahead so fast and so quickly a laptop basically could have been will some day be a supercomputer and is close to getting there under the definition that we have in policy today we need to understand that in trying to restrict the exportation of this technology the world has changed i think this is one of the key areas that shows how we need to adjust in the old days we did not want this technology to get out there because it had national security implications and it clearly does if one has good encryption technology if one has good computing technology it affects ones ability to have weapons basically to commit harm to do a variety of things it has military significance but the question is how do we prevent other people from getting that technology can we simply as the united states put our arms around it and say we are not going to let it out and nobody else is going to get it no encryption technology in particular one can download it off the internet dozens of other countries sell it it is going to get out there in fact this is going to hurt our national security because if we restrict the exportation of encryption technology in this country our companies will slowly fall behind they will not be able to get the customers because they will not be providing the best product as we fall behind and other countries get further ahead of us in this technology we lose our ability to be the leaders in the technology the encryption companies software companies in this company who produce encryption technology cooperate with the fbi and the nsa to help them show them the advances in the technology that helps us be ready to deal with the national security implications if we lose that leadership role countries in other parts of the world are not going to share that information with our national security agency or the fbi we need to be sure that we allow the exportation of that encryption technology so that we can continue to be the leaders in that area another important area is education and that gets to the change points in a rapidly changing world we need to constantly update our skills we live in a society where all of us are going to need to continually be learning we need to adjust our education system to understand that in the good old days when basically all one needed was a high school education and could go out and get a job and probably take care of their family my father did he had a high school education got a job as a ramp serviceman for an airline and ready did not update his skills very much during his 32 years with that airline and was able to take care of his family in todays world we need to update our skills we need to make sure that our education system is ready for that and that our education system is also ready to educate our children in technology issues and to enable them to change as rapidly as they need and update their skills the internet is the key to all of this the way the system basically works what computers and software enable us to do is they enable us to generate and store a large amount of data and that is very valuable as in the engine example i cited earlier by being able to generate that information they were able to develop a product that is the start of it the internet basically is the step that enables one to transmit that data back to the example of a retail clothing shop if it is a chain if they have 25 or 30 stores spread throughout the country they can share data basically being in any one of those stores is like being in the home office and by being able to share that data enables the company to move forward or if they are designing something they can trade the design back and forth and not have to be in the same place what we need to do is we need to encourage the internet overregulating the internet would be one of the biggest mistakes our government could make it would put us in a position of restricting its ability to grow and it is very important that we allow the internet to grow and prosper and do the things for our economy that it has already started to do there is also an issue and this is primarily in the area of biotech but also in other areas of patents we need patent reform so that people have the incentives necessary to develop new products secure in the knowledge that they will be able to keep the patents on those products and benefit from them otherwise they will not get into the field and try to develop them research and development is also a critical element we have in this country the research and development tax credit unfortunately it is only good for one year and every year we have to come back and renew it well we need to make that permanent the reason is because if one is a company planning for the future and deciding how much to put into research a lot of these products are not developed in one year and if one does not know if the resources are going to be able to be there for more than one year it hampers ones ability to make that investment we have the opportunity to permanently extend the r d tax credit this year and give companies that incentive to go out there and continue to develop the new products that they need to develop lastly and this is tied into the internet we have the issue of broad band basically access to the internet the internet is great but currently only about 20 percent of households in this country have access to it and a much smaller number very minute number have access to socalled broad band internet access put simply broad band means that the internet moves more quickly for us now if one is just sending email or simply surfing the net that may not be such a big issue but if one is trying to send data if one is developing that new design if one is in the automobile industry one develops a new design for an automobile and one wants to send it out to ones top 25 executives throughout the world to be able to send that much data over the internet requires a larger pipe otherwise it will take forever to send the data out and to download it to whoever has received it the most important thing in this area is we need to build the infrastructure think of the internet today in the same way that the railroad was in the 20th century in the 20th century the railroad gave us the ability to connect our country but first we had to build the track and it was very expensive to build that track so we gave incentives to go out there and build it and it made a lot of sense because it helped grow our economy rapidly we need to do the exact same thing with broad band technology we need to give companies ever incentive out there to go out there and build the infrastructure lay the fiber lay the cable put in the phone lines do whatever is necessary to connect as many people in this country as possible not just to internet access but to fast broad band internet access overregulation can kill this if we regulate companies too much so that they do not have the proper economic incentives to go out there and build the infrastructure it will not happen because yes there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow if you are the company that best develops internet access but you have to make a major investment up front to get there and you may not be willing to do that if the environment is too regulated those are just six issues that i think we need to touch on but the important thing is simply to embrace change understand the new economy we cannot fight it it is not an option it is here we need to understand it and try to make sure it works i think one of the greatest challenges for this country is to make sure that it works for everybody because right now it works fairly well for the top 20 percent but the potential is there to make it work for everybody and we need to understand it and go about addressing the issues in a way that make it available to the entire country because it has the massive potential to keep our economy moving forward to keep productivity high and to create good jobs that is why i think that the new economy and the high tech aspects of that new economy is so critical i am pleased to have with me the gentleman from new jersey who is going to address these issues as well"], [0.0001849532127380371, 0.999815046787262, 1, "we have heard two presentations one by the democrats and one by the republicans on the budget we will have the budget on the floor tomorrow to vote on and nothing is more important than the budget this week but nothing is more important than the budget at any time the most important decisions we make in washington are the decisions related to the budget and the appropriations process the budget is the opening of the process which ends with the appropriations process people should understand that we broadly categorize certain spending goals in the budget and then it is the appropriations process that carries them through with the detailed expenditures i want to talk about the congressional black caucus budget a budget for maximum investment and opportunity which we will have on the floor tomorrow as an alternative to the presidents budget and the budget of the majority republicans our budget is very important and i am going to spend half my time talking about the priorities of that budget the six priorities of that budget but the seventh priority is the one that i want to begin with the mission of our budget is clearly the congressional black caucus budget an advocacy budget it advocates for those that are left out and forgotten the poor in general and more specifically african americans and other neglected minorities we concur with threequarters of the presidents budget and his priorities but we would like to emphasize certain kinds of things that get left out so in each one of these seven areas education housing health care economic development and livable communities foreign aid welfare and lowincome assistance and juvenile justice and law enforcement we have special kinds of priorities that we have within those categories we would like to make certain that those do not get left out this presentation will start with priority number seven which is a very unusual priority for the congressional black caucus to focus on that is juvenile justice and law enforcement law enforcement now i understand that in the democratic alternative budget that is going to be presented tomorrow there will be some recommended increases in the law enforcement budget the justice department budget but that is all about increasing at the investigative end increases for the prosecutions in general there are a number of things that are going to happen in that proposed set of budget increases that we are not particularly concerned with we would like to see the justice department capacity increased to handle some other kinds of pressing emergencies for example we have an explosion of high profile corruption and malfunctioning of the criminal justice system across america in los angeles in illinois louisville kentucky and new york on and on it goes right now we have these high profile cases that should attract the attention of all americans certainly the overwhelming majority of americans are concerned about these malfunctionings and this corruption certainly in the case of amadou diallo and the verdict of a jury there in new york state the capital albany related to a case where amadou diallo was standing on his front step and was approached by four policemen and they shot him to death fortyone bullets were fired he was hit 19 times and some of the bullets show he was hit after he was on the porch nevertheless those policemenwere found not guilty of anything not negligent homicide not reckless endangerment not guilty of anything a survey taken a few days later showed that the overwhelming majority of the people of new york state were outraged they disagreed profoundly with that verdict and felt that a great miscarriage of justice had occurred but on the other coast in los angeles we had a series of revelations over the last few months indicating that the police department has been carrying out corrupt practices for almost two decades that there are people in the police department who routinely routinely have planted evidence on people of drug selling evidence of various kinds planted guns on people beaten people and shot people and the los angeles government now is getting ready to pay out millions of dollars in response to court suits that are being brought on these matters as well as many many cases that will be overturned the lives of numerous individuals thousands of individuals when we consider the families of the people who have been wrongfully convicted or harassed beaten up the lives of thousands of individuals are involved in this gross systemic ongoing set of miscarriages of justice in the state of illinois we have a situation where there were 25 people on death row 25 people about to be executed we were about to play god and take their lives i am against the death penalty but those who are for the death penalty certainly would not like to see innocent people executed there was a special project conducted by some university students and they utilized the most advanced detective techniques including dna to check to see whether these 25 people were really guilty or not they were on death row they had gone through the whole system the district attorneys had brought cases against them they had been prosecuted by public prosecutors a judge had sat on the case a jury heard the case and now it was all over they were on death row to be executed under our constitution we guaranty the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but if a persons life is taken there is nothing else theyare going to be able to do they cannot pursue happiness liberty means nothing a death penalty takes away that life and of the 25 people who were on death row 12 were found to be innocent dna evidence about as conclusive as it gets was used to prove that 12 of the 25 on death row were innocent and i congratulate the governor of illinois for acting after that immediately to say there will be no more executions until we straighten out this tangle where is the criminal justice system going wrong how did it produce an almost 50 percent error rate in a matter as serious as taking the life of an individual for the commission of a crime twelve of the 25 were innocent let me see i have mentioned los angeles and illinois let us now go to louisville kentucky there was a killing of a young man by the louisville kentucky police two policemen were involved the police commissioner without telling the mayor decided to give these two policemen a medal awarded both of them a medal now they have gone through a process i think of being checked out with disciplinary hearings and steps have now been taken but they were given a medal and the mayor was not informed about this they were just given a medal two medals by the commissioner and the mayor rightfully so feit that that was an outrage to do that for something that one was questionable but to do it without his approval without his involvement was a usurpation of his authority and it was making a statement about his position on this kind of action that clearly was in defiance of his policies so the mayor of louisville kentucky fired the police commissioner and right now we have almost a coups taking place in louisville kentucky the police are marching through the streets indicating that they are really in command the police that should be under civil authority are refusing to acknowledge that the mayor is the final authority that the man who is elected who hired the commissioner had the right to fire him the problem is if we allow a police state mentality to develop in a small group that spreads to the larger group and pretty soon we are the victims of police state actions i cannot remember any time that a whole police force has defied their chief executive the mayor of a city and gone out and thrown down the gauntlet they are refusing to protect the citizens they spend their time in demonstrating their strength it is illogical to allow the criminal justice system to become corrupted what we have in america is a small percentage of police the extremists the fanatics and sometimes they are racists who commit crimes and acts of misconduct that by themselves are outrageous but we say after all it is only a small percentage of a total police department the problem that all america should be concerned with is the way the rest of the police department goes to work to cover up to protect and to nurture the fanatics and the extremists and the racists there is the socalled blue wall of silence where no matter what is done they will protect them and anybody that tells the truth will be isolated and browbeaten and harassed to the point where they will have to leave the force the code of conduct in police departments all across the country is that the truth is not to be told if it will get one of their colleagues in trouble so it makes the whole system corrupt as we go up the chain of command the officer at the top including the commissioner becomes involved in a pattern of coverup if the pattern of coverup and protection is there it means that the officers who are at the extreme end begin to have more and more people join them more of their kind come on to the force because they have protection of the system i have talked about los angeles illinois and louisville kentucky in louisville kentucky it is the police marching to take over the city a coups by the police department against the city government in new york where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated their outrage in the amadou diallo shooting we now have another shooting of a young man named patrick dorismond who lives in my district he was killed the mayor and the commissioner are behaving as if they want to stage a coups and take over the city against the majority the majority are outraged but they insist on behaving in ways that protect and encourage and nurture that small percentage of extremists in every police department the mayor has made outrageous statements about the last killing patrick dorismond a constituent of mine his family lives in my district patrick dorismond was in manhattan leaving work as a guard he was a uniformed guard he left work and went to a bar nearby he left the bar and was hailing a taxi to get home when an undercover policeman approached him attempting to entrap him in a drug sale the undercover policeman asked him if he had some drugs to sell he wanted some drugs this same undercover police team had already made eight or nine arrests that night they just wanted to bolster their statistics and make ten collars that night so they approached one more patrick dorismond patrick dorismond was outraged as he was being approached and asked for drugs an argument ensued and the backup policeman came on the scene to support his partner who was in the argument he shot patrick dorismond to death patrick dorismond is dead and the two policemen say it was an accident most unfortunate it was an accident and the mayor of the city of new york mayor guiliani ordered the commissioner told the commissioner to immediately release the criminal record of patrick dorismond patrick dorismond at 13 had had some kind of encounter with the police the laws of the state of new york say that the record of a juvenile should be sealed not only did they disobey the laws of the state of new york and open sealed records but they also broadcast them all over the nation patrick dorismond had had a runin with the police when he was 13 like a lot of 13 year olds may have a runin with the police patrick dorismond had had two arrests as an adult for disorderly conduct so happens that patrick dorismond wanted to be a policeman so the two disorderly conduct arrests that he had had as an adult plus the arrest that he had had as a juvenile wopld not have disqualified him from becoming a policeman they were not that serious but the mayor has chosen to make patrick dorismond look like a criminal by putting these things together and he has fooled no one the whole city is outraged again it is double outrage after the amadou diallo verdict now comes patrick dorismond with the mayor and the commissioner engaging in a blatant way in a coverup i mean they are encouraging and setting the parameters for the coverup in this case the system has gone to work to deal with some extreme activities on the part of individual policemen there were other cases of course besides amadou diallo there was abner louima who was sodomized with a broomstick in a police precinct abner louima almost bled to death in fact the hope was by the policeman who had so injured him that he would die but unfortunately for the policeman he lived fortunately there were complaints made by the family and they got through to a reporter and he got to hospital and he survived and the whole case broke as an exposure of what had gone on in that precinct most of the police in that precinct would not tell the truth the blue wall of silence went into effect immediately and nobody saw anything abner louima had to endure a horrible experience and they tried to pretend that nobody held him down while the guilty police officer committed that crime fortunately the federal government stepped into the situation and from the beginning showed a great interest and prosecuted the policeman for violating the civil rights of abner louima abner louima is not dead fortunately he is probably injured for life he will never function normally again but there was a trial and after almost a year of denying that any crime had been committed the blue wall of silence was at work concocting stories about abner louima having engaged in homosexual activity and that is how his guts were erupted or torn inside him all kinds of concocted ridiculous stories were manufactured until finally in the federal trial in brooklyn the perpetrator confessed that he had done it and was found guilty of course by his confession however even after confessing he wanted the world to believe he did it all by himself and nobody else saw it wanted to protect his colleagues and came back to court to testify in a second trial a conspiracy trial the conspiracy trial related to abner louima was probably more important than the trial which convicted the man who perpetrated the heinous act against abner louima because the conspiracy trial goes to the heart of the problem the heart of the problem is the fact that the colleagues of the perpetrators the colleagues of the extremists of the fanatics of the racists cover up for them they pretend they saw nothing they heard nothing the system in effect to cover up for the crime committed against abner louima his relatives went to the police station the next day and they were threatened and told to get away from there or they would be arrested all kinds of horrible things happened before this case began to rise and surface in such a way that the police department had to admit that a great crime had been committed and they had to go to work to do something about it but when the federal government entered the case early and began to question the police officers the blue wall of silence went into effect so they took a very important step in trying four of those officers for conspiracy to cover up because that is the heart of the problem the system has to be changed the system has to be attacked the federal government at this point has also completed a study of the pattern of activity in new york city with respect to the stopandfrisk and the way they police minority neighborhoods what does this have to do with the budget let me go back for a moment and say that all those people out there who were upset about the amadou diallo verdict and there were many people there was a spontaneous set of demonstrations high school kids without any tutelage or planning left their schools and demonstrated in the streets college kids demonstrated white and black there was no group that did not show their outrage today on the steps of new york police plaza a press conference took place of businessmen businessmen and labor leaders rabbis civil liberties leaders urban league a press conference took place where they all together condemned the latest activities of the mayor with respect to exposing the criminal record of dorismond as a 13yearold child and taking a position in defense of the killing of patrick dorismond before the facts were examined thoroughly our constituents in new york are very upset outraged demanding action from their leaders our constituents are demanding action against these gross misjustices fortunately none of these spontaneous responses have been violent we keep telling people it does not pay to go out in the streets and burn anything down or conduct riots as leaders we have been successful in making people understand that negative and unproductive set of conduct that should not be followed however they turn to us and say what are you going to do what about it well i want to say it does relate to the budget here because in our budget item number 7 is the juvenile justice system we want more money put into the federal criminal justice system juvenile justice adult justice law en forcement in general we want more money put in we also have a bill that will require more funds in the justice department that bill was put in by the gentleman from michigan 2 weeks ago and i would like to let everybody know out there the constituents that we are not standing still we are taking certain kinds of actions this bill the law enforcement trust and integrity act is going beyond what we have done already we have gone to the justice department we have gone to the deputy of janet reno we made our appeals there we have gone through those motions on these particular cases especially amadou diallo and we have now gone to the justice department about patrick dorismond in brooklyn the unitedstates attorney in that district the eastern district now has had a discussion on that so we are taking action at the level that we think we can take the most relevant actions we have accreditation of the bill that the gentleman from michigan has introduced the law enforcement trust and integrity act which will require additional funding by the justice department if they carry out these points i will just quickly summarize what the bill says the bill calls for the accreditation of local law enforcement agencies not to operate so loosely they should have a set of procedures and standards a training regiment which does not allow for inexperienced people to be set loose on the street with guns in their hands but make certain that they have had thorough training not only in the use of force but also an understanding of the community that they are patrolling this bill authorizes the department of justice to work cooperatively with independent accreditation law enforcement and communitybased organizations to further develop and refine these accreditation standards second point law enforcement agency development programs the bill authorizes the attorney general to make grants to local states and governments to develop programs such as civilian review boards early warning and detection programs which have proven effective in many jurisdictions and many kinds of activities which would help develop a greater rapport between police and the community administrative due process procedures the bill requires that the attorney general study the prevalence and impact of any law rule or procedure which interferes with prompt and thorough investigations of abuse in new york city they have the 48hour rule the police department the police benevolent association their union negotiated an agreement where no policeman who is involved in an excessive use of force case can be interrogated before 48 hours fortyeight hours must pass before they have the right to interrogate a policeman who is involved in some incident related to excessive use of force or the firing of a gun even if it resulted in the killing of an individual item four in the law enforcement trust and integrity act sponsored by the gentleman from michigan it enhances the funding of the civil rights division in the civil rights department it authorizes appropriations for expenses for ongoing investigations of pattern and practice of abusive investigation by the justice department item five in the pattern and practice investigations it enhances the authority to bring private cause of actions limited only to declaratory and injunctive relief when there is a pattern and practice of discrimination item six deprivation of rights under color of law the bill amends section 242 of title 18 of the code to expressively define use of force and nonconsentual sexual conduct as deprivations of rights under color of law item 7 the study of deaths in custody referring back to the illinois case the bill amends the code to require assurances that states will follow guidelines established by the attorney general for reporting deaths in custody national task force on law enforcement oversight the bill requires the department of justice to establish a task force to coordinate the investigation prosecution and enforcement efforts of federal state and local governments in cases related to law enforcement misconduct immigration enforcement review commission the bill creates a commission to investigate civil rights complaints against the ins and customs services with authority to make policy and disciplinary recommendations it is very interesting that in new york several of the cases that have taken place have related to immigrants amadou diallo was an immigrant from africa the country of guinea patrick dorismond is a haitian american abner louima is a haitian american i know this is only a coincidence because i have lived in new york for 42 years and there is a long list of victims of excessive force negligent homicide that were not necessarily immigrants eleanor bumpers was a grandmother who was shot down in her living room claude reece was a 13yearold who lived in a housing project in my district clifford glover was 11 years old and was shot in the back randolph evans was shot pointblank by a policeman who used a defense in courtcalled psychomotor epilepsy i have never heard that term before and since that case that trial i have never heard it since well the jury found the policeman not guilty because he hadhad a seizure of psychomotor epilepsy and he could not stop his hand from raising the gun and pointing to young randolph evanss head he walked off scotfree so there have been a long list of deaths of police killings and police brutality which did not deal with immigrants but it just happens that recently the focus has been by accident i think on immigrants so an immigrant enforcement review commission is very much in order item 10 federal data collection on racial profiling the bill requires the justice treasury and interior departments to collect data concerned with personal characteristics of individuals targeted for investigation etcetera the bill establishes civil and criminal penalties for retaliation against law enforcement officers who in gods faith disclose initiate or advocate on behalf of a civilian complainant in actions alleging police misconduct and creates private cause of action for retaliation these are 11 of the points that are emphasized in the law enforcement trust and integrity act many of them will require additional funding my colleague the gentlewoman from texas"], [0.0002097487449645996, 0.9997902512550354, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman from california for yielding and i thank her for putting together this special order tonight and for her leadership on this issue in the house it is an important issue i rise this evening to speak about this critical issue of education for our nation when we talk about that we talk about our children i often wonder having served at the state level in north carolina for 8 years where i saw the funds coming the federal funds and let me remind our colleagues and the people who might be listening this evening that when we talk about federal funds they only represent about 7 percent of the total money spent in this country on education is that insignificant no is that the only amount we can have well let me explain to folks that if we go back to the 1960s it was about 15 percent so it is not a magic number it is just a number that we live with today because the money has been cut over the years did that money make a difference absolutely because it was categorical money folks tend to forget that in the 1960s we decided math and science were important in this country after sputnik we put the resources in and did it make a difference absolutely it made a difference it gave us a lead in science and technology that we are enjoying the benefits of today our public schools responded and so did our universities now why people need to have movement of funds from one category to another in that is very easy there is not enough money in them if there is enough money in those categories they would not need to steal from staff development for teachers and for teacher recruitment and those dollars that are badly needed it is important that those dollars be there because i think the federal commitment as the gentlewoman has pointed out is so critical it says that it is important to this nation here just today we have stood on this floor and talked about how important our teachers are and now we have a chance to decide that we are going to turn words into actions i said today words are cheap talk is cheap we ought to walk the walk instead of talk the talk i happen to have a son who teaches the fourth grade if we paid teachers the minimum wage we would be raising the salary of teachers in this country because they put in an awful lot of hours they are not compensated for i think a lot of folks think of teachers working from maybe 7 30 or 8 oclock to whatever time is school is out in the afternoon what they do not realize is those teachers grade papers in the evenings they take children on field trips on the weekends and here we are arguing about a few dollars it is a lot of money in terms of what schools get but if we look at it in terms of the whole federal budget it is not really a great deal of money but a h2752 co few dollars at the classroom level where teachers are makes a big difference we have colleagues here who want to say well it is just where the teacher is no we need people for staff development we need people in the principals office we need people in the central office because someone has to coordinate all of this we need people at the federal level i know when i was state superintendent i depended greatly on the federal office of education for research and development monies and yes for those grant monies so it does make a difference that we have those monies in those categories it is amazing to me that we want to talk about taking it away and that is really what we are talking about any way we cut it we are going to take it away from some of the most needy children in this country the very children that we want to raise the threshold for and make sure that in the 21st century they have a chance to make it we talk about the digital divide and i will talk about that more in just a moment but the digital divide is nothing compared to the divide that we are going to have for the children who do not have the opportunity to learn to read and reading is fundamental that do not learn to do math early because many of the children show up at the public schools in this country who have not had the opportunity before they get there for a variety of reasons the biggest one being poverty if there is one thing that we can classify it reaches across ethnic lines no matter whom they are a child who shows up from poverty is a child more likely to be behind in school and have a difficult time if we do not give children a good education we relegate them and the future generation to poverty that is what public education is about in this country america is really the one place in the world that says no matter where one comes from we give them an opportunity to step up to this great smorgasbord we call public education if one is willing to work for it but if america is going to seize this opportunity of a new economy in the 21st century congress must provide national leadership in this vital effort we cannot capitulate now the one time we have a chance to make a difference we ought not to just lay down and play dead i have often said there is a big slip between the lip and the hip and that really comes with a lot of talk and not a lot of resources to get the job done across this country the american people are crying out for a greater investment in education i have been in probably many schools maybe more than most people in this body having been superintendent and i go back regularly i have never had a child the truth is i have never had a teacher tc ask me who paid for something in the school whether it was local state oi federal they just know they do not have enough there are surveys after surveys that tell us that teachers take money out of their pocket to make sure they have resources in the classroom for their children now i am here to tell my colleagues tonight that is not right here we are arguing about a few dollars that we are going to send to help make education better for the poorest of our students because those are the ones the teachers take money out of their pockets for they are the ones who are there that we are not paying as well as we ought to i told someone today my colleague may have overheard it when we go through the grocery line in the checkout and pay for our groceries because the teachers are not paid like they should be in my opinion they do not have a checkout that says if you are a teacher come through this line and if you are a millionaire come through this line we all go through the same line we ought to recognize that if we truly value what our teachers do and i do i think we have to do a better job and i think folks are expecting us to do it the leadership in this house the republican leadership has to join with us to make it happen we have to stop arguing about those things like school vouchers every year they want to talk about school vouchers that isnot the answer to the problem because if that were the answer we would have all been on board a long time ago all that is is a way to take money off the top and deny those mostneeded students their opportunity we can talk about all we want in saying well competition is what we need inschools we have 53 million students in school in america this year and 94 percent roughly in this country and in some states it is higher than that it is 95 96 percent they are in the public schools so the key is for us to use what resources to use the kind of influence and support we have to help all of our children do better i think our schools are doing a far better job today than they have ever done for all of our children there is no question about that no one can tell me that is not true after looking at the data and look at the data across years but the challenge we have is what we have done last year or 5 years ago is not good enough it will not suffice in the hightech economy we find ourselves in competing with the world we cannot drain off resources from bur public schools and leave our children behind condemned to a bleak future of failure as we work in this special order tonight i hope we can share with the american people that our commitment is to our public schools it is to make sure that every single child has an opportunity one of the things we have done in this country is make sure that children try to make sure that children show up ready to learn we can tell a difference in a child who comes from a background who has not had those opportunities if he just had one year of head start good head start or preschool in north carolina as my colleagues well know our governor has worked with the general assembly and they are now putting in a prekindergarten program they call it smart start we had some when i was superintendent that we used federal monies for that and it makes all the difference in the world it is a publicprivate partnership and in some cases we are working with other groups but for the children who have not had that enrichment who show up at school who do not know their colors who have not been read to when they were little folks it makes all the difference in the world it helps the teacher when we have 26 28 and in some cases 30 children i often remind folks that fay and i were fortunate we have 3 children i would have hated to have had 26 of them trying to teach them some days it was tough with 3 people do not realize what it is in that classroom teachers are liable to stay in that classroom if they want to go to the bathroom they have to get relief there are not many jobs like that today i think we need to honor them and respect them our job here in washington ought to be talking about how we can make it better not create situations that are barriers to those teachers and th6 teachers are the ones who really understand the problems the children have they do not want the money to be taken away from staff development education may be the only place i am aware of where we tell teachers that they have to continue to get recertified and they to pay for it themselves most businesses that i know of pay for their employees to go to get continuing training we are starting to do a better job but we are not there yet where we are paying for all of them i think if we honor education and we care for our children and our teachers we ought to be about doing those thipgs our schools can do better and they will with our help but only if we are willing to help we need to foster a greater connection i think between students teachers parents and the broader business communities one of the points we were talking about earlier if a community gets involved it is amazing what happens to students one of the things you talked about earlier that are so important we have to reduce class sizes but if we talk about reducing class sizes on the one hand and take away staff development for the teachers and the training opportunities they have all of a sudden we are working against ourselves because we are saying well this worked well but we are going to take that away and put it over here what we really need is to enrich anc help that whole system we need staff development for teachers and adminis trators we need to make sure that when we are looking at roughly 2 million teachers we are going to need ir the next few years we ought to be looking for ways we can energize and put money out there we did it in the sixties when we wanted to do math and science we are going to have to do it again if we honor and believe in education i happen to believe very strongly that i would not be here in the united states congress if it had not been for public education and i would say to the bulk of the members neither would they they should not forget from whence they came i would not be here if we had been in the process of vouchers and all these other things i would not have gotten the kind of education i did i went to the public school and whatever the most affluent child in my community got i had the opportunity to get that is true of most of the people in this body we should never forget that we should not deny that opportunity for any child in america no matter where they come from ethnically nor where they come from economically because who knows who knows one of those youngsters may find the cure for cancer or any other number of diseases eventually they may be in this body making some of the same decisions we have a tremendous challenge we need a national commitment we need that commitment to the notion that parents in america have the right to expect that their children will have the best teachers in the world and we cannot have attract nor retain the best teachers if we do not support them it is one thing to get them there it is equally as important to keep them there with pay respect and support that means staff development that means when they need help we respond that we honor what they do rather than criticize what they do that bothers me greatly when i hear members in this body do that i was pleased today that we passed a resolution but i will repeat one more time now that we have said the words we need to walk the walk we need to have an education bill that bespeaks of how important education is in america for every child whether he lives in the richest suburbs or the poorest inner city or the most isolated rural parts of america he should have the opportunity for aneducation i think block grants and vouchers are not the way to go we would ultimately waste the ability of children in this country we must make sure that every neighborhood school in america works i thank the gentlewoman for putting together this special order"], [0.00026303529739379883, 0.9997369647026062, 1, "i too would like to add my words of congratulations to admiral johnson for very excellent career in the navy and upon his retirement and his last tour of duty as chief of naval operations we in guam had the opportunity to work with him on a number of issues i always found him to be supportive more importantly he served at a time when the navy was being asked to do many things he was able to carry that out successfully with grace and always before congress and before the committee on armed services making a great case for the navy tonight i take the opportunity to do a special order on the anniversary of something that is very important to the people of guam and something that will be commemorated next week i want to take this opportunity to explain a little bit about it to provide the historical background for this event august 1 1950 was the signing of the guam organic act next tuesday on guam there will be a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the organic act many times unless one lives in a territory perhaps the term organic does not really mean much but organic act means it is an organizing act an act that organizes the local government pursuant to an act of congress so it was that on august 1950 president harry truman signed the guam organic act creating and making permanent a local civilian government providing for a locally elected legislature and providing for an independent judicial system that had a direct linkage into the federal court system and most importantly providing unitedstates citizenship for the people of guam the people that i represent this is the 50th anniversary of congressional action which brought an end to military government in guam a measure of real democracy to a group of loyal people of loyalty that had been just tested during a horrific occupation by enemy forces during world war ii and were therefore granted unitedstates citizenship the organic act was preceded by a very sustained effort on the part of the people of guam the islands leaders and many friends of guam and supportive persons in the united states here in congress and in the administration of president truman as well as president roosevelt and in the national media who at the time in the late 1940s people who took a direct interest of the affairs of what were to happen to dependent territories coming out of world war ii the organic act formally ended although it had ended a few months earlier by presidential action the congressional act entitled the organic act put an end to military government in guam a form of government meant to be temporary but which lasted some 50 years a military government a clearly unamerican form of government clearly undemocratic form of government in which the people of guam basically lived under the control of military officers whose primary duties were military in nature and whose secondary duties included the civil administration of a people that they saw as a dependent people as wards of the state clearly untenable and undemocratic form of government unfortunately many people in the military had continued to justify the continuing nature of this government by saying that guam had very strong strategic value for the united states and that therefore the people of guam should not enjoy too many civil and political rights under military government the people of guam were called unitedstates nationals under a military government government was created by fiats mandated by the naval governor of guam called general orders every time he wanted to make a law he simply called in a scribe they numbered these laws in consecutive order ranging from general order no 1 first promulgated in 1899 right up until the very end of naval rule some 50 years later one of those rules encapsulated the civil status of the people of guam and it was called general court martial order no 1923 held while the people of guam owed perpetual allegiance to the united states they are not citizens thereof nor is there any mechanism through which they could become citizens so as far as the navy was concerned the people of guam owed perpetual allegiance to the united states but they were not unitedstates citizens and more importantly there was no way that they could become unitedstates citizens that is probably the most outrageous general order in the whole series of general orders that were prosecuted on the people of guam throughout naval government that led to a citizenship movement this movement for unitedstates citizenship was seen in guam as the way to eliminate the vestiges of military government if one wanted to get rid of military government it was assumed that if people were declared unitedstates citizens that it would simply be untenable to continue to have military officers run the life of the island this citizenship movement was led originally by two men b j bordallo and f b leon guerrero during the 1930s they made a trip here into washington d c met with the president met with a number of congressional leaders to argue for a unitedstates citizenship for the people of guam the way that they funded their trip was to go through the villages of guam with a blanket that was carried at all four points and citizens and children would throw pennies and dimes and nickels into the blanket after doing this for a few months they were able to secure enough funds to fly the then china clipper to come here and spend several months making their case in washington d c they were able to a meet with president roosevelt and they were able to prevail upon two senators senator tydings from maryland and senator gibson from vermont who subsequently introduced a bill granting the people of guam unitedstates citizenship and it passed the senate that bill went to the house where it died on the basis of a congressional testimony made by secretary of the navy claud swanson that said the people of guam were living on too strategic a piece of real estate to be concerned with such things as civil and political rights subsequent to that of course the people of guam endured an occupation by the japanese during world war h coming out of world war i there was a renewed spirit here one had a war that was essentially fought to end tyranny and at the conclusion of the war there were a number of territories and dependencies that existed throughout the world so the united states and great britain and france and other countries that were on the victorious side of world war ii had then created the united nations in order to ensure a peaceful and stable world and introduced as part of the un charter article 73 which was meant to deal with nonselfgoverning territories that the countries that were responsible for these areas had a distinct responsibility to promote selfgovernment and selfdetermination for these nonselfgoverning territories the united states voluntarily placed a number of territories on those lists of nonselfgoverning territories to dramatize to the world how sincere the commitment was to end the whole nature of colonial government in the world also commensurate with this effort which was in the national consciousness and with the local citizenship movement there was an effort by citizens of the united states who were very friendly to the idea of civilian government for guam and citizenship for the people ofguam these people were led by an anthropologist by the name of dr laura thompson who founded the institute of ethnic affairs she worked very closely with her husband john collier and former secretary of the interior harold ickes and a couple of people in the media one was foster hailey with the new york times and richard wells an attorney who had formerly been stationed in guam right at the end of world war ii these people in turn worked towards generating media stories that appeared in colliers magazine saturday evening post a lot of very popular magazines at the time about what the exact conditions were in the territories both american samoa and guam but guam offered the more dramatic story in the meantime the navy tried to counteract this effort by instituting their own by assigning a number of officials to point out the blessings of military government all of this came to a head when the naval governor of guam the last naval governor by the name of admiral pownall was presiding over then a bicameral what was called the guam congress the house of council and the house of assembly there was a provision in the law at the time that said that in order to run a business on guam 50 percent of the ownership had to be of guamanian origin so that the people of guam would not be at the time subjected to undue competition from foreign sources but there was a civil service employee who was surreptitiously running a dress shop the assembly subpoenaed this individual by the name of abe goldstein he ran a dress shop called the guam style center they subpoenaed him to appear in front of the house of assembly mr goldstein conferred with the admiral and the admiral told him he did not have to appear in front of the assembly that the assembly had no power to subpoena anyone so the assembly became very upset and walked out and adjourned and said that they would not reconvene until it was made clear by the naval governor what the extent of their authority was information on this particular walkout was front page news in several newspapers including in san fancisco and honolulu and attracted a lot of attention this effort was coordinated by a man by the name of carlos taitano who is still very much with us today and who will be the principal celebrant of the guam organic act celebration next week carlos taitano at the time was a member of the guam assembly the leader of the walkout was a man by the name of antonio borja won pat who also had spent several months in washington after world war h advocating unitedstates citizenship for guam he was the speaker of the assembly the author of the walkout the speaker of the subsequent guam legislature after the institution of the organic act and eventually the first delegate to the unitedstates house of representatives from guam so mr won pat is probably the single most important political figure in the history of guam in the 20th century in november of 1949 there was a hearing in guam on legislation introduced this is pursuant to this walkout in march 1949 it was seen that something had to be done legislation was introduced in the house the public lands committee went to guam in november of 1949 had a hearing and in that hearing the main concern presented by the people of guam interestingly was land during the intervening time from the reinstitution of the navy military government of guam after world war ii the navy had acquired over a third of the island probably about 40 percent of the island closer to 40 percent and people were told that they were going to get their land back we have had this difficulty ever since and we are trying to resolve this in a comprehensive way that issue is still very much alive today and was part of a bill that was passed in the house earlier this week h r 2462 the guam omnibus opportunities act now the actual act that passed congress passed both the house and the senate was based on h r 7273 which was a modified form of the earlier version and it was introduced by congressman hardin peterson of florida in this final act it set up a system of government which we would call clearly undemocratic in todays terms but seemed very democratic at the time one it provided for a unicameral legislature of 21 members elected by the people of guam and limited to two 30day sessions a year within the organic act it provided for a local court system but if one had a felony case or a case involving more than 5 000 in a civil suit one had to go to a federal court so it established a federal district court so the scope of the local courts was limited even though it established a kind of independent judiciary of course the main feature of this organic act passed in 1950 was it did not have an elected governor what we had at the time was a governor that was appointed by the president so even though it was a civilian and was not a person in uniform and even though we had disestablished the naval military government of guam clearly there was much progress to be made but for 1950 now we are talking about 1950 this organic act of guam was seen as very progressive in the entire pacific compared to all the other territories which france and great britain had and some of the other islands in the pacific this looked like a very progressive step so indeed the organic act of guam in 1950 was highly regarded at the time and widely supported and of course the good feature the unique feature about it was the acquisition of unitedstates citizenship the first civilian governor of guam that was appointed by president harry truman was carlton skinner who was a young progressive governor who made a very skillful transition from military to civilian government he was a very important figure in the development of the organic act and the move from military to civilian government and he also will be joining us in guam on august 1 to commemorate the organic act but the politics of the environment changed along with elections to president and in 1952 with the election of president eisenhower a new governor was selected for guam a man by the name of fordq elvidge who wrote an article after he finished his term in the saturday evening postentitled i ruled uncle samsproblem child it was a very uncomfortable article to read nevertheless ford q elvidge allegedly had an experience which indicated how strong the military still was in guam he was appointed to be governor of guam but up until the year 1962 people could not go to guam and people could not leave guam unless the navy allowed them to leave or unless the navy allowed them to come in this was called military security clearance unless an individual had security clearance this act lasted all the way until 1962 it was started right at the beginning of 1940 as the situation between japan and the united states started to darken so this military security clearance executive order was declared by president franklin roosevelt well ford q elvidge as he boarded a plane to leave honolulu to come to guam to take over as governor was stopped by military officials who refused to let him go on the plane because he did not have the appropriate security clearance from naval authorities only pointing out how deeply rooted military authority was in the lives of the people after some discussion on the matter they finally relented and they allowed the governor of guam actually to go to guam so this situation existed in guam for another 20 years finally in 1968 an elective governorship bill passed the congress allowing thepeople of guam toelect a new governor the judicial system was simultaneously changed to expand the scope of the authority of the local court system and later on in 1970 and 1971 there were laws passed in the house of representatives to create the office of the delegate for the virgin islands and a delegate for the people of guam so after the completion of those elements it sort of completed the cycle and it certainly gave the sense that there was complete local selfgovernment in guam the people of guam elected their governor but this was still 20 years after the original organic act the people of guam elected a delegate to congress which gave them some opportunity to participate in the affairs of the house although of course in the final analysis there is no voting representation an interesting story when mr won pat first came as the first delegate there was some discussion in the initial house rules as to whether to pay him a full salary or not there was some discussion about that fortunately for all the successors to this office they agreed that they would pay the same salary as they pay other members of congress but it shows in a way the kind of stepbystep process but there was still something fundamentally incomplete about the organic act and that is that at the end of the day the organic act is not a local self constitution the organic act is an act of congress and every time we need to change portions of that act we have to come back to congress there is a provisionthat allows the people of guam to create a local constitution but to date that has only been exercised once and the proposed constitution was defeated because the people of guam felt strongly that there was still a more fundamental issue even than the creation of a local constitution and that is the exercise of selfdetermination as i indicated earlier the united nations system which was organized by the victorious powers coming out of world war ii in order to demonstrate that they were on the right side of democracy and to show that they meant democracy for everyone created a system called the nonselfgoverning territory system inside the united nations to this date guam and american samoa and the virgin islands remain on those lists of nonself governing territories because there has not been a full exercise of selfdetermination to decide in what direction they wish to go and what directions are made available to them by what is termed in the united nations language of thisrelationship the administering power so guam continues to be a nonselfgoverning territory it remains a nonselfgoverning territory because it does not have any voting participation in the laws that are applicable to them in any respect so an individual living in a territory and a law is passed here on the endangered species act or a law regarding the regulation of land or the law regarding taxation and that law has some applicability to that person it violates the very first tenet of the american creed which is government by the consent of the governed and there is no consent to governance now one can argue that there is a sense of participation that there is some level of involvement but at the end of the day there is no real consent of the governed and of course people in the territories do not vote for the president though of course he is our president as much as he is the president of any other american and we go off to war just like we go off to war with other americans as well and he is our commander in chief today at the end of the day and some 50 years having elapsed since the passage of the organic act many see the organic act in guam as reflective of past events and to some extent past political traumas as seen as evidence of continued federal control of guam as seen as passe at worst maybe transitional at best but i believe that that is looking backward forgetting the sweet victory that the organic act represented in 1950 it was the kind of progress that was possible at the time and it was progress that many people worked hard to achieve it took many people to get us to that point and we must not forget the efforts of those very hard working sincere persons from guam as well as their friends here in washington d c who brought genuine political progress to guam we must not forget that they slain real dragons they overcame real barriers and they brought down a systemof military government that in the final analysis did not really want to leave so the organic act while it is properlyseen in its historical development for the island i represent is certainly not the magna carta for guam or the declaration for guam or not even the constitution for guam but it is an important document that embodied a fundamental shift of government from people in uniform to people in civilian clothes a document that embodied the principle that there should be some consent of the governed over laws that are made locally that embodied and most importantly recognized the loyalty of the people of guam through an horrific occupation and finally declared them to be unitedstates citizens en masse at this time that we recognize this very important anniversary for the people of guam we must be mindful of the fact that there are still many tasks ahead of us but at least let us remember august 1 1950 and on august 1 2000 take time and reflect upon our past history the work of such great people in my own islands history like antonio borja won pat f b leon guerrero and b j bordallo and take the time to honor and pay tribute to those men"], [0.000268399715423584, 0.9997316002845764, 1, "it is with true pleasure that i stand up here today to talk about a program that is so important to america and that is our social security program i come from southwest louisiana cajun country bordered on the west by the state of texas and on the south by the gulf of mexico i have in my district some 100 000 citizens and families and individuals that are receiving some sort of benefits from our social security program they are the disabled they are the retired and they are the children who have lost a parent the program was established back in 1935 it was established as a response to the economic changes of the great depression back then the average lifespan was only 61 years old today the average lifespan of americans is 76 years old and steadily rising history has shown that deliberate alterations of this program have been very beneficial to our great social security program it is a program that is very popular it is a program that is going to be around here because what it has done for the american people what it has done for our elderly population has been incredible we have the most healthy the highest quality of life of elderly population not even arguably than anywhere else in the world it is because of the commitment that this congress should make and other congresses have made to saving social security and taking care of it in times that are just like today that are very good it has only been many years since this social security program has been around it seems like so long ago but it truly has not been throughout the 1950s congress altered the structure of social security to try to meet the needs of the changing american people they raised the social security benefits by some 77 percent throughout the 1950s they altered means testing and also raised the payroll taxes in the 1960s for the first time they allowed disabled workers to receive compensation that was only for retirees up to that point in time the 1980s saw some changes in the fiscal structure of social security congress passed legislation to gradually back in the 1980s increase the minimum age of social security and the benefits but clearly this program has survived time has survived the challenges that have accompanied and have faced americans because this program is so greatly used and needed for the betterment of the american people it has risen to those challenges one in six americans today receive some sort of social security benefits three million children are the beneficiaries of this program currently social security needs to increase its revenues in order to address the financial obligations to the rapid increasing number of retirees the baby boomers if you look at it and look at the demographics of the american people they are changing dramatically today there are approximately 3 2 workers paying into the social security system and only one beneficiary that is going to change in a few short years as america gets older as the baby boomers start to retire that ratio is going to be narrowed to only a two to one margin we cannot simply sit back in good economic times that we are seeing today and let this program go unnoticed and let this program run into more financial difficulties because if you look at the numbers it is very very clear that soon the revenues that are coming into this program will not be enough to take care of the beneficiaries not only the increase but also the larger number of people that put the money back into social secuare getting into the program rity and make sure that we pay for tax o 1630 cuts from other areas i hope my colleagues will join with i believe that it is incumbent upon me in saving this program because this congress to take the surplus that there are over 14 000 children i repeat we are experiencing and have experi 14 000 children in my district the 7th enced in fiscal year 1998 that has just district of louisiana that are counting passed us to shore up social security on this congress to make sure that this in fact i will go one step further do program is around for the next generawe really have a surplus if we look at tions the numbers this year fiscal year 1998 as i look up in the audience they america had a 76 billion surplus for just walked out but there were a whole the first time in many many years host of generation xers the next genthrough the efforts of a lot of people in eration of leaders the next generation this congress the balanced budget of members of congress who were here agreement was the big important piece who actually have a question about of legislation that got us there how whether their social security is going ever we borrowed 99 billion out of the to be there for them when they grow up social security trust fund to mask and enter the work force and then rethat deficit should we not ask our tire i can say that if this congress and selves do we truly have a surplus in this gentleman from south louisiana this country has anything to do about that it will i believe every american out there not only be there but it will be that pays fica taxes and every em strengthened because i think it is imployer believes these funds should be portant for the quality of life for all of put into a social security trust fund our seniors the american people deand put back into the very system that serve it it was intended to be in let us save social security now do over the past few years we have bor it the right way and in a fiscally rerowed somewhere upwards of 600 bil sponsible way lion out of this trust fund it is part of i yield to the genthe unified budget i understand as a tleman from arkansas mr marion small business owner i understand in a berry unified budget where there are dif mr berry i want to ferent revenue streams that they are thank my colleague from louisiana put all together to make a business and appreciate what the gentleman has run to make government run but now said here this afternoon and madam is the time to put up social security speaker i rise today in support of fisand make sure that we save this impor cal responsibility and budgetary comtant program mon sense which i think we all are in ttrogrta osupport of putting that money back into social as this budget debate has begun and security is not the only thing needed it continues i am reminded of a fellow to help this program this program is that i used to eat breakfast with every going to need other structural changes morning for 30 years i ate breakfast changes that have been talked about in the same little cafe the rice paddy there are several commissions lots of cafe there in gillett arkansas and study groups task forces and think pretty much the same group of men tanks giving us advice in this congress would sit at the table every morning i to talk about how we go about fixing am sure the speaker has been in cafes the structure of the program like that in her district they are wonthere are some things that are being derful places tossed around the president talked i had this friend that when harvest about investing some money in the time would come well he would eat stock market investing some of the breakfast there every morning and money for privatization of it increas then late in the afternoon on his way ing the taxation benefits means test home he would stop there and get a ing benefits adjusting the cpi the cup of coffee and when he would come consumer price index also raising the back in every afternoon to get that cup retirement age all of those things are of coffee during harvest time he would being considered today as structural have figured all over his pant leg he changes to save this program would have a ball point pen and he i believe that while social security would be calculating on his blue jeans was never ever intended to be the sole his pant leg there retirement system and the sole income when the combine would make the stream of americans it has helped mil first round he would estimate how lions and millions of individuals and much grain he had and then he would families from being at or below the start figuring out how much money he poverty line in america was going to have sometimes he would i hope that my colleagues from both figure he was going to have lots of sides of the aisle recognize the need to money and he would go buy some exsave social security recognize that pensive item like a new car or someyes we have a surplus but we need to thing before he got his crop harvested infuse it back into the very program and before he sold it then when he where the surplus is being generated would go home that night well his from yes we want tax cuts i have wife would wash his blue jeans and the voted for them and i will continue to next morning all of his money would be vote for them but we must be able to gone that is kind of the way i think of this situation we are in right now i think we need to take a realistic look at our national budget we keep hearing about this budget surplus this magical surplus that everyone wants to spend we all love to spend money especially if it is someone elses the fact is there is no surplus the sad fact is that the taxpayer dollars designated for the social security trust fund are being used to cover up the true amount of the national deficit if we take the social security trust fund out of the equation we will have a surplus not until the year 2001 that surplus could beminuscule even then compared to the billions and billions of dollars that we keep hearing about when we do get a surplus i personally would rather not count those chickens until they hatch we still have a matter of 5 6 trillion in debt to contend with that should be enough money to scare every one of us those who advocate spending these surplus monies on new programs like tax incentives should look to the private sector for advice if we asked our local banker if he had a customer that was 5 6 trillion in debt and the customer wanted to spend more what would the banker say to them would we want to give them a loan if we were running the bank as world leaders would our country say to an irresponsible nation that was 5 6 trillion in debt that is okay what the heck we will just give them a couple more billion it will not matter i do not think that is what we would do if we were going to be responsible throwing good money after bad hurts our taxpayers our economy and our longterm prosperity how can we use any future surplus responsibly first we can pay 6ff the national debt second we must ensure social securitys solvency just putting more money into the program will not work we need comprehensive bipartisan reforms taking the social security trust fund off budget is a good first step third we must ensure that the medicare program is there forever and for all of our seniors like social security medicare needs some longterm reforms there is no question that its benefits are outdated its payment structure is unwieldy and its reimbursement to rural areas is just plain unfair setting aside money for medicare out of any surplus will not end the programs problems but it will provide a cushion in the event our medicare beneficiaries need it paying down the debt shoring up social security and saving medicare this is a reasonable thing to do it is a responsible thing to do and it is a responsible use of the future surplus today i want to urge my colleagues to reject a foolhardy proposal that will spend nonexistent surpluses and create billions of new spending let us do with our national budget what the american people do with theirs let us balance it let us keep it balanced and let us be responsible and whatever we do let us do not wake up in the morning to find out that our surplus disappeared when we did the wash last night i think it is a responsible thing to do and i urge my colleagues to join me in this effort"], [0.00028628110885620117, 0.9997137188911438, 1, "i rise in support of the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill h r 4541 i reluctantly intend to vote for this bill today despite the fact that i have some very serious concerns about both the process that has brought this bill to the floor and some of its provisions let me speak first to the process in the commerce committee democratic members worked cooperatively with the republican majority to craft a bipartisan bill that addressed investor protection market integrity and competitive party issues raised by the original agriculture committee version of the bill as a result we passed our bill with unanimous bipartisan support following that action we stood ready to work with members of the banking and agriculture committees to reconcile our three different versions of the bll and prepare it for house floor action but after just a few bipartisan staff meetings the democratic staff was told that democrats would henceforth be ssional record extensions excluded from all future meetings and that the republican majority leader was going to take the lead in drafting the bill whats more we were also told the chairman of the senate banking committee was invited into those negotiations despite the fact that this bill comes within the agriculture committees jurisdiction over in the senate and the senate has not even passed a cea bill in fact the senate agriculture committee decided not to include the swaps provisions sought by the chairman of the senate banking committee when the committee reported s 2697 because these proposals were viewed as so controversial we then went through a period of several weeks in which the republican majority staff caucused behind closed doors the product that resulted from those negotiations was so seriously flawed that it was opposed by treasury the sec the cftc the new york stock exchange the nasdaq and all of the nations stock and options exchanges the entire mutual fund industry and even some of the commodities exchanges democrats the administration the cftc and the sec suggested a number of changes to fix the many flaws in this language and over the last several days many of them have been accepted that is a good thing but i would say to the majority if you had simply continued to work with us and to allow our staffs to meet with your staffs we could have resolved our differences over this bill weeks ago we shouldnt have had to communicate our concems through emails and third parties we really should be allowing our staffs to meet and talk to each other having said that let me turn to the substance of this bill there are two principal areas i want to focus onlegal certainty and single stock futures with regard to legal certainly i frankly think this whole issue is overblown congress added provisions to the futures trading practices act of 1992 that give the cftc the authority to exempt overthecounter swaps and other derivatives from the commodities exchange actwithout having to even determine whether such products were futures i served as a conferee when we worked out this language and it was strongly supported by the financial services industry now we are told we need to fix the fix we made to the law back then but i would note that when former cftc chair brooksley born opened up the issue of whether these exclusions should be modified she was quickly crushed the other financial regulators immediately condemned her for even raising the issue and the congress quickly attached a rider to an appropriations bill to block her from moving forward the swaps industry was never in any real danger of having contracts invalidated on the basis of the courts declaring them to be illegal futures they were only in danger of having the cftc think about whether to narrow or change their exemptions but the cftc was barred from doing even that what we are doing in this bill is sayingo k we are going to take otc swaps be tween eligible contract participants out of the cea they are excluded from the act now i dont have any problem with that if the swaps dealers feel more 6omfortable with a statutory exclusion for sophisticated counterparties instead of cftc exemptive authority and the agriculture committee is willing to agree to an exclusion that makes sense thats fine with me however i am not of remarks october 23 2000 willing to allow legal certainty to become a guise for sweeping exemptions from the antifraud or market manipulation provisions of the securities laws that is simply not acceptable while some earlier drafts of this bill would have done precisely that the bill we are considering today does not that is a good thing and that is why i am willing to support the legal certainty language today however i do have some concerns about how we have defined eligible contract participant that is the sophisticated institutions that will be allowed to play in the swaps market with little or no regulation the bill before us today lowers the threshold for who will is an eligible contract participant far below what the commerce committee had allowed i fear that this could create a potential regulatory gap for retail swap participants that ultimately must be addressed the term eligible contract participant now includes some individuals and entities who should be treated as retail investorsthose who own and invest on a discretionary basis less than 50 million in investments these are less sophisticated institutions and individuals and they are more vulnerable to fraud or abusive sales practices in connection with these very complex financial instruments if bankers trust can fool procter and gamble and gibson greetings about the value of their swaps what chance does a small municipal treasurer or a small business user of one of these products have for example under one part of this definition an individual with total assets in excess of only 5 million who uses a swap to manage certain risks is an eligible contract participant for that swap i think that threshold is simply too low i dont believe that removal of these retail swap participants from the protections of the cea makes sense unless the bill makes clear that other regulatory protections will apply to this end the commerce committee version of h r 4541 would have required that certain individuals or entities who own and invest on a discretionary basis less than 50 million in investments and who otherwise would meet the definition of eligible contract participant would not be eligible contract participants unless the counterparty for their transaction was a regulated entity such as a brokerdealer or a bank that helps assure that they are not doing business with some totally flybynight entity but with someone who is subject to some level of federal oversight and supervision it is not a guarantee that the investor still wont be ripped off but it helps make it less likely the bill we are considering today weakens this requirement the commerce provision only applies to governmental entities as opposed to individual investors the threshold for application of the provision to such entities is lowered to 25 million and the list of permissible counterparties to the swap is expanded to include some unregulated entities i believe the original commerce committee investor protection provision should be fully restored moreover the bill should clarify explicitly that counterparties who may enter into transactions with retail eligible contract participants are subject for such transactions to the antifraud authority of their primary regulators i also have some concerns with the breadth of the exemption in section 106 of this bill and its potential anticompetitive and anticonsumer effects there may be less anticompetitive ways to address an energy swaps exemption in a way that provides for fair competition and adequate consumer protections in this market such a result would be in the public interest what is currently in the bill is not and i would hope that it could be fixed as this bill moves forward let met now turn to the provisions of this bill that would allow the trading of stock futures these new products would trade on exchanges and compete directly with stocks and stock options now i have serious reservations about the impact of single stock futures on our securities markets in all likelihood these products are going to be used principally by day traders and other speculators now there is nothing inherently wrong with speculation it can be an important source of liquidity in the financial markets but one of the purposes of the federal securities laws has traditionally been to control excessive speculation and excessive and artificial volatility in the markets and to limit the potential for markets to be manipulated or used to carry out insider trading or other fraudulent schemes i am concemed about the prospect for single stock futures to contribute to speculation volatility market manipulation insider trading and other frauds that is why it is so important for the congress to make sure that if these products are permitted that they are regulated as securities and are subject to the same types of antifraud and sales practice rules that are otherwise applied to other securities i think that this bill if thesec and the cftc properly administer it can do that first with respect to excessive speculation the current bill provides that the margin treatment of stock futures must be consistent with the margin treatment for comparable exchangetraded options this ensures that 1 stock futures margin levels will not be set at dangerously low levels and 2 stock futures will not have unfair competitive advantage visavis stock options the bill provides that the margin requirements for security future products shall be consistent with the margin requirements for comparable option contracts traded on a securities exchange registered under section 6 a of the exchange act of 1934 a provision in the bill directs that initial and maintenance margin levels for a security future product shall not be lower than the lowest level of margin exclusive of premium required for any comparable option contract traded on any exchange registered pursuant to section 6 a of the exchange act of 1934 in that provision the term lowest is used to clarify that in the potential case where margin levels are different across the options exchanges security future product margin levels can be based off the margin levels of the options exchange that has the lowest margin levels among all the options exchanges it does not permit security future product margin levels to be based on option maintenance margin levels if this provision were to be applied today the required initial margin level for security future products would be 20 percent which is the uniform initial margin level for short atthemoney equity options traded on unitedstates options exchanges second with respect to market volatility the bill subjects single stock futures to the same rules that cover other securities including circuit breakers and market emergency requirements third with respect to fraud and manipulation the bill subjects single stock futures to the same type of rules that are in place for all other securities these include the prohibitions against manipulation controlling person liability for aiding and abetting and liability for insider trading fourth among the bills most important provisions are those requiring the national futures association to adopt sales practice and advertising rules comparable to those of the national association of securities dealers under the bill the nea will submit rule changes related to sale practices to the sec for the commissions review because investors can use single stock futures as a substitute for the underlying stock they will expect and should receive the same types of protections they receive for their stock purchases it is significant that in its new role the nfa will be subject to sec oversight as a limited purpose national securities association the sec is very familiar with the sales practice rules necessary to protect investors i expect the nfa to work closely with the sec to ensure such protections apply to all investors in securityfutures products regardless of the type of intermediarybrokerdealer or futures commission merchant that offers the product fifth the bill applies important consumer and investor protections found in the investment company act of 1940 to pools of single stock futures this ensures that investors in pools of single stock futures will enjoy the same protections as other investors in other funds that invest in securities in addition to these provisions the bill also addresses a number of other important matters it allows for coordinated clearance and settlement of single stock futures it assures that securities futures are subject to the same transaction fees applicable to other securities it requires decimal trading and it provides treasury with the authority to write rules to assure tax parity so that single stock futures do not have tax advantages over stock options in addition to these provisions the bill represents a substantial change from the status quo in which the sec and the cftc have shared responsibility for ensuring that all futures contracts on securities indexes meet requirements designed to ensure among other things that they are not readily susceptible to manipulation this bill gives the cftc the sole responsibility for ensuring that index futures contracts within their exclusive jurisdiction meet the standards set forth in this bill most important among these requirements is that a future on a security index not be readily susceptible to manipulation because the futures contract potentially could be used to manipulate the market for the securities underlying an index it is critical that the cftc be vigilant in this responsibility relying solely on the market trading the product to assess whether it meets the statutory requirements is not enough in particular the cftc should consider the depth and liquidity of the secondary market as well as the market capitalization of those securities underlying an index futures contract perhaps even more importantly the cftc should require that a market that wants to offer futures on securities indexes to unitedstates investorswhether it is a unitedstates or foreign markethave a surveillance sharing agreement with the market or markets that trade securities underlying the futures contract the cftc should require that these surveillance agreements authorize the exchange of information between the markets about trades the clearing of those trades and the identification of specific customers this information should also be available to the regulators of those markets finally if a foreign market or regulator is unable or unwilling to share information with unitedstates law enforcement agencies when needed they should not be granted the privilege of selling their futures contracts to our citizens there is one other important matter that i had hoped would be satisfactorily resolved today but unfortunately it has not last night the republican staff deleted language that appeared in earlier drafts that would have amended section 15 i 6 a of the securities exchange act of 1934 to clarify that singlestock futures futures based on narrow stock indices and options on such futures contracts security futures products are not new hybrid products i believe that this deleted language should have been reinserted into the legislation let me explain why currently a new hybrid product is defined as a product that was not regulated as a security prior to november 12 1999 and that is not an identified banking product under section 206 of the grammleachbliley act unless an amendment to the definition is made security futures products potentially would fall within this definition section 15 i of the 1934 act provides that the securities and exchange commission must consult with the federal reserve board before commencing a rulemaking concerning the imposition of brokerdealer registration requirements with respect to new hybrid products section 15 i also empowers the federal reserve board to challenge such a rulemaking in court this provision was never intended to apply to situations where the congress has decided by law to expand the definition of securities what we are doing today in this bill is establishing a comprehensive regulatory system for the regulation of security futures products under this system it is clear that intermediaries that trade securities futures products must register with the sec as brokerdealers although it allows futures market intermediaries that are regulated by the cftc to register on a streamlined basis h r 4541 rests on a system of joint regulation that means that both the sec and the cftc are assigned specific tasks designed to maintain fair and orderly markets for these security futures products amending the language on page 170 to exclude securities regulation of security futures only because they are sold by banks would create an anomalous result a bank selling securities futures could register with the cftc as a futures commission merchant but unlike other entities it might not have to notice register with the sec effectively half of the regulatory framework that the sec and cftc negotiated over with the congress for many months would disappear there is no public interest to be served in eliminating sec oversight over issues such as insider trading frauds market manipulation and customer e1879 sales practice rules just because a bank traded the security the role of the federal reserve board with respect to new hybrid products would be at odds with the regulatory structure for security futures products under h r 4541 there is no reason to undermine the structure of h r 4541 by giving the federal reserve board a role in the regulation of brokerdealers that trade securities futures products if this provision remains in the bill i believe that in order to comply with the intent of congress as expressed in title ii of this bill the sec would have to proceed by rule to require all bank futures commission merchants seeking to sell single stock futures to at minimum notice register with the sec in addition the cftc would have to bar bank futures commission merchants from selling the product unless they have notice registered with the sec this isa convoluted way of dealing with a drafting problem that we could and should fix right now but it is the only way to prevent gaping loopholes from opening up that could harm investors because there has been an effort over the last several days to address some of the concerns that democrats have had about tax parity swaps language in section 107 of the bill mutual fund language and numerous other important provisions i am reluctantly going to vote for this bill today it is not the bill i would have crafted it still contains some serious flaws but it is a much better bill than the bill that passed out of the agriculture committee however i must also say that if when this bill goes over to the other body some of the outrageous and anticonsumer provisions that were deleted from the house bill in recent days are to be restored or other equally objectionable new provisions are added i will fight hard to defeat this bill and so i would suggest to the financial services industry and to the administration if you really want to get this bill done this year you need to forcefully resist anticonsumer or anticompetitive changes to the legal certainty language the tax parity language the single stock futures language and instead strengthen the consumer and market integrity and competitive provisions of the bill in the manner i have just described i look forward to working with members on the other side of the aisle and in the other body to achieve that goal and i hope that we can have more of a direct dialog on this bill as it moves forward than we have had over the last few weeks"], [0.0002917647361755371, 0.9997082352638245, 1, "i yield myself 7 minutes i come before us this afternoon as the ranking democratic member on the joint economic committee fulfilling a

would have believed we would have seen us move ahead of japan in these measurements in our lifetime inflation was 1 6 percent in 1998 we would have to go back to the early 1960s to find inflation that low furthermore it has remained low despite falling unemployment which confounds many of the economists the once famous and now forgotten misery index the combination of unemployment and inflation the lowest point in 40 years that is before the gentleman from new jersey and i even got to this place the economy has generated 15 million new jobs net since 1992 and 2 8 million jobs were added in 1998 alone the average weekly takehome pay after inflation has increased by 2 percent in 1997 and 1998 after almost 20 years of stagnation the current expansion is not just a statistical phenomena it has improved the standard of living for many americans let us not celebrate because this economic expansion is not yet shared by all americans and that is not acceptable to the democratic party one in seven counties in this country have twice the unemployment rate of the rest of the nation some research shows that although there are fewer numbers of people receiving welfare there is no definition as to what has happened to them are they working or have they merely dropped off our statistical radar screen and what has happened to their children there is still more that we need to know in order to ensure that all americans can enjoy the quality of life they deserve when things go well everybody is taking credit somebody said success has a thousand parents and failure is an orphan but it is easy to be entangled in the cause and effect and one thing is clear eliminating the budget deficit has enabled interest rates to fall which in turn is considered one of the major stimulants for our economy our first goal in fiscal 2000 should be to ensure that social security and medicare are financially secure in order to provide health care to those who need it the republicans agree to wall off the social security trust fund but their budget proposal does not do anything to address the solvency of either social security or medicare their proposal calls for a freeze in medicares administrative budget over the next 10 years we have hearing after hearing about how we have satisfied the medicare operators so that they can go after fraud and abuse and put these egregious profithungry private hmos and hospital chains that are stealing from the government out of business we have the lowest administrative overhead in medicare of any program in the country about 2 percent compared to 10 to 30 percent for private insurers and managed care plans the latter figure includes overhead and profit but we cannot continue this good work if we are unwilling in a budget to support the administrators who make it work so well former speaker gingrich once said that medicares administrative agencies should wither on the vine as should the program although no longer here mr gingrichs wishes seem to be with us as the republicans attempt to destroy medicare and its ability to serve the need of americas seniors and disabled let us talk about budget surplus there is a lot of talk about it but i did not see one once we take social security off of the table as the republicans suggest we are left with about 125 billion over the next 5 years and without touching the social security trust fund i do not think we find a surplus until 2002 so if we are going to make policy based on the surplus why do we not wait until we know there is one around and then debate it during 1999 defense expenditures were 13 percent greater than all nondefense discretionary spending i wonder if this really reflects our countrys priorities republicans go further and add billions to defense and it calls for a cut in discretionary spending now i do not happen to think the pentagon is optional it certainly is not but if the pentagon is not optional neither is head start public health programs education job training housing veterans hospitals law enforcement environmental programs the national parks community and economic development rural programs highways energy among a few which are being eliminated or cut severely if the republicans do not intend to shove us into the greatest deficit we have had since ronald reagan forced us into a deficit by reckless tax cuts and even more reckless military spending on things like star wars and other things which produced nothing but welfare for otherwise unemployable scientists and wouldbe soldiers of fortune i predicted that we would strike a deal to kick people off welfare and we have but what we have done is harm the childrenand the helpless in this country in the republican effort to grab more tax cuts for 1 or 2 percent of the very rich and that is not again what the democratic party is about my republican colleagues did not vote for the 1993 act not one of them voted they are taking credit for it but it has not stopped them from bragging about it eliminating the deficit was the single largest explanation for the current health of this economy and we must not jeopardize it again i urge my colleagues to oppose this budget resolution send them back to the table to bring one that will help the economy for the long run and help all americans i include the following for the record crisis facing hcfa millions of americans the signatories to this statement believe that many of the difficulties that threaten to cripple the health care financing administration hcfa stem from an unwillingness of both congress and the clinton administration to provide the agency the resources and administrative flexibility necessary to carry out its mammoth assignment this is not a partisan issue because both democrats and republicans are culpable for the failure to equip hcfa with the human and financial resources it needs to address what threatens to become a management crisis for the agency and thus for millions of americans who rely on it this is also not an endorsement of the present or past administrative activities of the agency congress and the administration should insist on an agency that operates efficiently and in the public interest over the past decade congress has directed the agency to implement administer and regulate an increasing number of programs that derive from highly complex legislation while vast new responsibilities have been added to its heavy workload some of its most capable administrative talent has departed or retired other employees have been reassigned as a consequence of reductions in force at the same time neither democratic nor republican administrations have requested administrative budgets of a size that were in any way commensurate with hcfas growing challenge the latest report of the medicare trustees points out that hcfas administrative expenses represented only 1 percent of the outlays of the hospital insurance trust fund and less than 2 percent of the supplementary medical insurance trust fund in part these low percentages reflect the rapid growth of the denominatormedicare expenditures but even accounting for medicares growth no private health insurer after subtracting its marketing costs and profit would ever attempt to manage such large and complex insurance programs with so small an administrative budget without prompt attention to these issues hcfa will fall further behind in its implementation of the many significant reforms mandated by the balanced budget act bba of 1997 in the future the agency also has to cope with a demographic revolution that it is ill equipped to accommodate and with changes in medical technology that will increase fiscal pressures on the programs it administers as the bipartisan commission on the future of medicare grapples with the problem of reshaping the medicare program for the next millennium it would do well to consider two important reforms concerning hcpas administration first the commission should recommend that congress and the clinton administration endow the agency with an administrative capacity that is similar to that found in the private sector second the commission should consider ways in which the micromanagement of the agency by congress and the office of management and budget could be reduced congress and the public would be better served by measuring the agencys efficiency in terms of its administrative outcomes such as accuracy and speed of reimbursement of various providers rather than by tightly controlling its administrative processes only if hcfa has more administrative resources and greater management flexibility will it be able to cope with the challenges that lie ahead the mismatch between the agencys administrative capacity and its political mandate has grown enormously over the 1990s as the number of beneficiaries claims and participating provider organizations quality and utilization review and oversight responsibilities have increased geometrically hcfa has been downsized when hcfa was created in 1977 medicare spending totaled 21 5 billion the number of beneficiaries served was twentysix million and the agency had a staff of about 4 000 fulltimeequivalent workers by 1997 medicare spending had increased almost tenfold to 5207 billion the number of beneficiaries served had grown to thirtynine million but the agencys workforce was actually smaller than it had been two decades earlier the sheer technical complexity of its new policy directives is mindboggling and requires a new generation of employees with the requisite skills hcfas ability to provide assistance to beneficiaries monitor the quality of provider services and protect against fraud and abuse has been increasingly compromised by the failure to provide the agency with adequate administrative resources even with the addition of 154 million to its administrative budget that congress included in its latest budget bill the likelihood that hcfa can effectively implement all of its varied assignments is remote the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 assigns many new regulatory responsibilities to hcfa but a far larger task is implementing the bba of 1997 the bba has more than 300 provisions affecting hcfa programs including the medicare choice option which will require complex institutional changes and ambitious efforts to educate beneficiaries medicare spending accounts for more than 11 percent of the unitedstates budget workable effective administration has to be a primary consideration in any restructuring proposal whether medicare reform centers on improving the current system designing a system that relies on market forces to promote efficiency through competition or moving toward an even more individualized approach to paying for health insurance congress and the administration must reexamine the organization funding management and oversight of the medicare program during anything less is shortchanging the public and leaving hcfa in a state of disrepair stuart m butler heritage foundation patricia m danzon university of

may consume i thank the chairman for yielding me the time i want to say that it is a great pleasure for me to rise today as we bring our bill to the floor the fiscal year 2001 appropriation for agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies i want to also begin by saying that this is the last bill that will be managed by my dear friend and colleague the gentleman from new mexico as chairman of the subcommittee because his limited subcommittee chairmanship has been reached under current house rules which i certainly would like to change he is and has been such a leader a fine gentleman in the true sense of the word a caring chairman an advocate for americas farmers and ranchers and a true friend to every single member of this institution so i wanted to acknowledge his hard work on this bill it has been a joy to work with him and i number these days and years among the most memorable of my own life i also want to thank the subcommittee staff hank moore martin delgado john ziolkowski joanne orndorf and our detailees anne dubey and maureen holohan and to the minority staff leader david reich and roger szemraj of my own staff for all the hard work that has gone into putting this bill together let me begin by saying that i come to the floor rather conflicted this morning this is a very very important bill and one that we will focus on today but we have just learned that contrary to an agreement that was reached yesterday the majority has chosen to place the sanctions language dealing with cuba and libya the issue that we debated for hours here yesterday into the supplemental appropriation bill contrary to an agreement that had been reached with the minority this is creating a great disarray that i think threatens not just this bill but the supplemental and its ability to move through the congress and also to be signed by the president there are many programs in there such as firefighting and so forth that are needed immediately in the western part of the country i would just urge the majority to remove that sanctions provision from the supplemental legislation this is a violation of an accord that had been reached with the minority and it truly places us in a most difficult position as we proceed forward with this bill today now let me say that this bill deals with the basics of life that touch every american every day have already touched every one of us as we awakened this morning the food that we have eaten the fiber that we wear the fuel that we use to move vehicles and in industry and forest production all the land and water conservation programs that cover the vast majority of private lands in this country the stewardship of those lands and the help that goes to those landholders is contained in this legislation the food that we ate this morning no doubt was influenced in millions of different ways by the research that has been supported over the years through th unitedstates department of agriculture all the marketing programs the safety that we felt when we ate that food that the milk was okay and that it was very healthy to eat the various medicines that we take our certainty that that medication will do what it says and if there is a side effect that it is labeled all of the food and drug administration programs come within our jurisdiction so this is a very important bill that goes to the center of life in america and we hope by our example that we can influence the worlds people as well the bills spending level is at about a level of 75 3 billion nearly a little more than 80 percent of that or 60 billion is what we call mandatory spending money that we have for important programs like the commodity credit corporation reimbursements that are central to the operation of our farm as sistance programs to those who produce that food fiber and forest product so there is 27 7 billion in the bill that goes to that major segment of this proposal the food stamp program which helps those who cannot afford to feed themselves in this country 21 2 billion contained in this bill an even more important program as welfare to work locks in across this country and our feeding kitchens and elderly feeding programs and so forth become short changed our school lunch program 5 4 billion so that every child in this country will have decent food at least during the week while they are in school 5 4 billion and 1 5 billion for the school breakfast program so those little ur chins out there their brains grow and as they go to school they are able to lead healthy lives and that they grow properly our conservation programs nearly a billion dollars here working with all the private owners of america to make sure that the land and the water and the ditches and the runoff is handled properly we are making progress there but we certainly have a long way to go this is an incredible piece of legislation of the total amount of spending 75 3 billion the discretionary amount the part our committee struggles with so greatly 14 5 billion is unfortunately 400 million below the spending of the current fiscal year this is a very tight bill hard choices had to be made in fact the entire bill is 400 million below this years spending when we discount the nearly 8 7 billion that was provided in emergency assistance last year now i said that this bill came forward under difficult circumstances the most recent nick however being the fact that the sanctions language was put into the supplemental against the will of the minority and against the agreement that was reached the allocation we were given by the committee on the budget makes it difficult to detail with responsible priorities submitted by the administration we are at least 1 6 billion in this proposal under the administrations request for all programs and as i mentioned 400 million under last year if we look at what was done in the supplemental which is linked to this bill directly there was nearly 400 million in the supplemental that we were expecting to help cushion the cuts and the lack of full support in this bill and we were told yesterday that that has now been reduced by 204 million which means that there is only about 195 million left in the supplemental which absolutely underfunds these programs at a time when rural america is just caving under the continuing low price situation the drought the high water levels in other parts of the country to be underfunding agriculture at a time when rural america is in recession makes absolutely no sense to this member now the bill as best as we were able to try to fund programs that are so necessary does have some additional problems for example in the animal and plant health inspection service we do not provide the resources requested by the president in fact we are 53 million below his request for funds to deal with the growing infestation in this country by invasive species other pests and viruses for example in the area of citrus canker in florida where entire orange and lime crops are threatened we do not have funding sufficient to deal with the eradication nor with trying to prevent further spread of that particular problem the same is true with pierces disease in california the administration released about 12 million this past week but that is not sufficient to deal with the vineyard problems all throughout california plum pox in states like pennsylvania which are affecting our fruit crops all of these dollars that were proposed by the minority to try to deal with the animal and plant health inspection service have not been fully provided i can tell my colleagues that failure to deal with these pests and failure to deal with prevention will mean costs in the future of billions and billions and billions of dollars to deal with something like the asian longhorn beetle which is destroying our hardwoods in chicago and in new york this is not an insignificant issue it has longterm consequences there are cuts in this bill unfortunately for the food for peace program june 29 2000 co 37 million below the presidents request we keep saying that access to foreign markets is what will help our farmers recover from low prices but at the same time we disarm ourselves by failing to provide the level of resources we need to get the job done and move our product into other markets certainly when we have a surplus to those people in our country and around the world who remain hungry and in fact in many quarters of the world that are starving in this bill also we fail to adequately fund or place restrictions on the use of funds to deal with the problems faced by the most needy and the most powerless people in our country for example there are insufficient funds in this bill for the 1890 colleges those colleges that have been dealing with those historically discriminated against in our society as we try to spread the knowledge of the department of agriculture in all of its different aspects throughout the university and college systems of this country further the bill prohibits further expansion of the colonias initiative to deal with the tremendous pollution at the southwestern border of mexico with texas new mexico and arizona so there is no additional funding in the bill for that important effort finally if we think about our food programs in general the underfunding is largely in the area of food programs certainly food stamps our school breakfast our school lunch our elderly feeding programs the women infants and children feeding program totally the funding in this bill is about a billion dollars under the administrations request on the conservation front which is so important to us as the most productive land on earth the conservation programs are 65 million below the presidents request in what we were able to provide in this bill with the significant erosion problems the drought problems and in my part of the country the significant water runoff problems right now they are having a real impact on our ability to hold soil and prevent leaching into our ditches rivers and ultimately lakes these conservation programs are more important than ever now in terms of the overall bill while we do not provide all prudent increases that i have just talked about we do not cut most programs under current operating levels and we do provide some modest increases in rural economic and community development programs and we have provided vital support for the food and drug administration i would be remiss if i stood on this floor however and i did not remind members that in this supplemental bill however there were severe cuts made in important agriculture programs such as the replacement of our"]],

all of you and i hope you get out there and enjoy the finest snow in the country out in colorado that was a little promotional spot here before i begin this evening getting back to serious business there are three areas that i really want to discuss with my colleagues first is the move by the president and the vice president their policy of releasing fuel or barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve i will talk for just a few minutes about that then i would like to move on from there and talk about taxes in the last few weeks with the presidential election coming up with the general election coming up for congress and the senate we have heard a lot about tax cuts and tax policies and surpluses so i want to go into that a little and i want to distinguish the difference between the two parties my remarks tonight are not intended to be personal at all but the fact is we do have a system which by design from day one has primarily two parties and it is one of the checks and balances there are general differences it is not applicable by the way to each member of each party but generally there are differences between the democratic philosophy and the republican philosophy tonight i hope to distinguish between the two of them especially when it comes to surplus when it comes to taxes when it comes to accountability to the taxpayer out there when it comes to accountability for the services that we are required to render to the people that we are fortunate enough to serve back here in the united states congress and then i would like to spend a few minutes talking about social security if a presidential candidate and i know george w bush has but if any candidate running for office this year wants to focus on one thing for the young people or two things for the young people let us say and for the women of this country and frankly for the middle class of this economy talk about social security what are we going to do my generation and the generation ahead of me is okay our benefits will be there but we owe it to the generation behind us to make sure that social security is a liquid fund is a fund that can sustain the kind of liabilities that we have placed upon it for the generation behind me and the generation behind that generation and the generation behind that generation that is our obligation it is a point we ought to discuss this evening i intend to talk a little about social security and some of the things and a plan that i think will work a plan that has worked for all the federal employees that work for the government today the government has its own plan and many of my colleagues out there their constituents do not realize that one of the proposals put out there in fact frankly the proposal put out by george w bush is a policy that is already followed by every government employee we as government employees already have this type of policy an opportunity to choose so we are going to talk about personal choice we are going to talk about social security and we are going to talk about the surplus we will talk about tax cuts and of course we want to talk about the strategic petroleum reserve first of all i think a logical question we have heard that a lot in the last couple of days most of us have a pretty good understanding of what the petroleum reserve is but for a little history as members know it was created in 1975 and the intention of it was to see if we could find a location which we did to store about 1 billion barrels of oil for an emergency reserve now emergency is a very delicate word emergency in my opinion means an overnight crisis for example if the middle east or opec cut our oil off i am not sure that you could classify as an emergency a price increase the likes of which we have seen in the last few weeks now it is a hardship but does it go to the level and that is the fundamental question we need to ask does it go to the level that we should draw down on what in essence is 59 days that is all we have of supply in this petroleum reserve we have 59 days of supply in there is the situation we are in right now of which i am very unhappy about i think frankly the oil companies have overplayed their hand ithink opec has overplayed their hand but i caution all of us to think very carefully before we condone the actions and the policies of the vice president andthe president in going into the strategic petroleum reserve and pulling out a significant portion of that reserve which by the way is not a significant portion of the consumption needs of this country in fact in any 30day period what you are doing is pulling out about a 36hour supply out of 30 days back to our history a little the reserve is managed by the department of energy i am a little disappointed by the way the department of energy has managed our energy policy i am not sure that we have an energy policy that exists we have the secretary of energy bill richardson this year and i would like to quote what bill richardson said he said we were caught napping its obvious the federal government was not prepared for the recent jump in oil prices we got complacent look department of energy you have an obligation not to be complacent that is what your department is in place for that is what congress has charged this department with you have got to be on the ball we have got to monitor that our country is economically dependent in a very significant way we are economically dependent upon the energy policies and when oil goes up like it has gone up we have not yet begun to feel it but we are going to begin to feel it but we have over here a reserve and we have got to be very careful about that reserve when we use it and under what kind of conditions we should use it we of course leave that discretion to the president of the united states i can tell my colleagues that right now as i mentioned our current days of inventory are 59 days we have 571 million barrels of oil the most we can draw down this is just for your own information so you have an idea of how large this reserve is we can draw down about 4 million barrels of oil a day and it takes about oh 15 or 20 days for that oil from when we draw it down assuming we have refinery capacity which we do not have today our refineries are at capacity for a number of different reasons but assuming we have capacity we can move that oil and get it into those refineries in about a 15day period of time so what has happened in the last few days first of all there was some rumor that the president might as kind of an october surprise as a policy for the upcoming presidential election to assist the vice president that the president might order that a depletion be forthwith out of the strategic petroleum reserve in regards to that last week the wall street journal quoted the secretary of treasury who is appointed by the president who had strong disagreement with the president and vice presidents policy to draw oil off this under the classification of emergency and let me quote the wall street journal wrote treasury secretary lawrence summers advised president clinton in a harshly worded memo that an administration proposal to drive down energy prices by opening the governments emergency oil reserve quote would be a major and substantial policy mistake mr summers twopage memo argued that policy he wrote that using the reserve would have at best a modest effect on prices and would have downsides that would outweigh the limited benefits let me go on further another expert one that republicans and democrats in other words both sides of the aisle an individual that both sides of the aisle respect his opinion on the presidents policy to draw down on that i think it would be a mistake to try and move the market prices with a small addition from the strategic petroleum reserve federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan told a unitedstates committee this year we are dealing with an overall market which is huge compared to our strategic petroleum reserve he said that adding from the reserve quote would not have a significant impact where the impact is that i am concerned about is what the president is doing we have the strategic oil reserve over here and as i said we have a 59day supply and it is to be used for an emergency that is our 911 call right there we have over here a market to give my colleagues an idea a market on a monthly basis just for our country which looks about like this so what you are doing by drawing down out of this is you are drawing in enough for a 36hour dent in this market thirtysix hours proportionately that is not too far off from what the president has ordered in the meantime what you are doing is you are drawing down a significant portion of this emergency reserve here the difficulty with that is at some point especially when we see the volatility that is now taking place with the oil markets it is a point in time i think that you should increase not decrease your emergency reserves now surely when you put this kind of fuel in for that 36hour period of time which is what it will supply for our country when you put it into the market and i believe in the last 24 hours gasoline not the gasoline but the texas crude price has dropped a little in the last 24 hours you are going to have some shortterm benefit but the shortterm benefit has a longterm expense associated with it i think it is very clear and it has been editorialized throughout the country including this morning in the wall street journal but i think it is very clear that the policy of the vice president and the timing consequently of the president to draw down on the strategic petroleum reserve is in fact not an emergencybut is a political convenience it is a political tool it is being used in a political manner that policy is incorrect the policy of those reserves all of us on this floor realize that politics is an everyday part of our life and when we are a month or 5 or 6 weeks out from an election we are going to see more politics but there are some areas that you have got to keep politics out of no matter how tempting it is no matter how close to the election it is the best interests of the nation demand that you not use that certain items that you do not use these items or twist your policies for political expediency instead what you think of first are the best interests of the country and i am concerned that the policy of drawing down this reserve to make a very small dent for a shortterm benefit and by the way the benefit would mostly be realized between now and election day and right after the election we are going to be in the same problem we were in before but we are going to have less reserve it is not a good policy i think the president and the vice president should stop trying or make no further attempts to draw down unless this country truly faces an emergency ever since this was created in 1977 excuse me in 1975 when we created this reserve we have only drawn down on it three times two of the drawdowns two of the drawdowns one was for the persian gulf war that was truly an emergency i do not think any of my colleagues here argue the fact that the persian gulf when we went to war that justified a drawdown on our emergency reserves the other two times that we drew down on that reserve were practice drawdowns to see how quickly we could get it out to make sure we had the logistics between the point of drawing out of the oil reserve and getting it into the refineries that we had that system down pat we did twice we had two trial runs so during the entire 25 almost 26 year tistory of this emergency reserve never has it been drawn down for political purposes never has it been drawn down because the price of gasoline got higher it has only been drawn down really in reality when you take outside the practices it has only been drawn down when we went to war but now the president and the vice president decide 4 weeks again now from the election or 5 weeks out from the election that it is time to draw it down my pointtonight colleagues whether you are democrat or republican is this ought to be hands off this should not be whether or not we draw down from the emergency petroleum reserve should not be determined by whether or not the general election is 6 weeks away our department of energy secretary frankly needs to get to work and shape that department up down there so they do not fall asleep at the wheel which is fundamentally what he admitted they had done in the last couple of months now do we have an answer sure you have an answer any time you have high prices there is that point of diminishing returns opec knows about it opec does not want the prices to get too high why do they not want the prices too high well if the prices get too high and the government does not try and manipulate the prices speaking of our government then what happens is american ingenuity kicks in one you begin to see more conservation i think that is a good reasonable policy and two you begin to get a reexamination of what we have done in our own country as far as exploration what are we doing with resources in our own country those are two good policies to follow i mean i think of myself the other day to give you an example i was driving off from the gas pump i just paid the price for gasoline and i said what can we do for conservation is there something we can do immediately to help conserve the product that we are using you know what i did i looked up in the lefthand side of the windshield of my car and i see in my car that they recommend i change the oil for the vehicle that i was driving every 3 000 miles and my recollection was that the drivers manual for that automobile recommended an oil change every 5 000 or 6 000 miles so i got in the glove compartment i looked at my owners manual and sure enough the people who built the car the people who engineered the car and the people who guarantee the car say look for ultimate performance all you need to do is change your oil every 5 000 or 6 000 miles it did not say every 3 000 but obviously it says 5 000 or 6 000 which means not every 3 000 if we found ourselves in a crunch the american people could immediately conserve on consumption of oil products by actually having the oil changes on their automobiles when the manufacturer of the automobile recommends you do it i mean that was just one idea but i think putting in government manipulation right before an election oh it may have some political benefits for the president but the fact is that in the long term folks it is going to be a very expensive way it is not the proper method to approach the kind of fuel or oil difficulties that we are now facing save this for a true emergency wait until you have a real emergency before you go out and start drawing down on the petroleum reserves taxes let me talk for a few moments now kind of switch subjects because i have heard a lot of discussions about taxes and surpluses tonight while i was sitting in my office i was thinking you know there really are some basic differences again not to get personal but i think it is important and i think it is important when we talk to the young people of our country that we explain that there are some differences fundamental differences between democratic leadership and republican leadership now not all democrats vote always with the democrats all the time not all republicans always vote republican with the republican leadership all the time as we know a lot of votes back here are determined by geographical locations for example those of us in the west may have a difference of opinion than those in the east regardless of whether they are republicans or democrats but clearly when it comes to government spending there is a difference between the democrats and the republicans i know as of late the democrats have been criticizing tax reductions and tax cuts i think we have to start with the basic philosophy of what is a surplus i just looked it up by the way i just looked up over here in the dictionary surplus which sits behind me and the definition is clear a surplus is you have more than you need the government is not in the business to make money the united states government was never intended by our forefathers when they drafted the constitution when they had this thought this dream of uniting these states of putting these 13 states together and expanding into the continent they never dreamed of putting the united states government in business what they wanted the government to do was to have their role restricted to that which individuals could not do that is what their concept of government was about what has happened recently and i hear it more and more from the democratic side from your policies of your leadership is somehow this surplus belongs to us us congress here in washington d c the taxpayers have not paid too much well if you do not think that the taxpayers have paid too much quit using the word surplus because surplus means it is extra you know we are here to produce and to provide that which individuals cannot do as individuals but we are not here to accumulate large amounts of money now the difficulty is that you cannot leave a surplus in washington d c very long because it is very simple it gets spent that is what happens to it if you leave this surplus here in washington d c pretty soon you are going to have new programs and new programs and new programs so the republican party and our leadership has made it very clear that we have two priorities number one the priority is to fund the government so that it runs efficiently and that we provide the fundamental services to the american people that individuals could not provide on their own for example we have tremendous responsibilities in education and we stand up to those responsibilities we have tremendous responsibilities to defense for this country to the military to our transportation but once we meet those responsibilities and once we meet the responsibilities of spending those dollars in a responsible manner then we have two other responsibilities one the next responsibility is that after and frankly again not getting personal but for 40 years the democrats controlled the congress and take a look at what happened to socalled surpluses then they were smoked they were gone the minute they got here we had deficits for 40 years so the next thing we do is what about our overall debt our leadership the republican leadership feels that we have an obligation to reduce that overall debt and that we should take a portion of this surplus and reduce that debt but the other fact that we have to consider is who is the customer who are the people that we represent whose money is coming in here it is not our money it is money sent to us with the idea that we will act in a fiduciary manner and spend that money in such a way that one we provide for government services and two if we find out that the people we represent have overpaid then in fact we should refund that now there are some other things we have to take into mind every once in a while when we are out there raising money i e the federal government is out there on the taxpayer and they ask the taxpayer they say to the taxpayer look we need to fund the military we need to fund education we have highways here is our government budget and in order to meet the budget we need to have you pay out of your work and remember the people paying are not the people that are not working the people that pay taxes to the government are hardworking men and women they are the people that go to work for 8 hours every day you are asking them to take a part of their labor every day a part of their labor every day in fact you are asking them to work full time from january 1 to i think around the first of may you are asking them to work full time that is what amount of time an individual has to work in this country just to pay off their taxes for that year so you are asking them to fund this once in a while when we do this we find out that we have taxes that are unfair taxes that just fundamentally are not sound i thought i would point out a couple of those because the republicans this year without much help now we did have i will grant to you we did have some help from some democrats but some of those democrats who helped us switched back unfortunately in my opinion because of the fact they were put under pressure by the president to uphold his policies so they would not override the vetoes but let us talk about a couple of those taxes i think the best way to do it is to talk about the middle class because that is who we are really talking about here what happened is we discovered some taxes that whether we have a surplus or not we fundamentally disagree with the concept of these taxes i will give you a good example the marriage penalty that is a tax that congress somehow in its history decided that marriage should be a taxable event the republican leadership this year with the help of some democrats said to the president and by the way obviously with the help of the united states senate said to the president look marriage should not be a taxable event it is unfair to the middle class it is unfair to anybody for the federal government in an attempt to raise money for its operations to go to people and say simply because of the fact that you are married we are going to impose a tax on you so what we did is we voted to eliminate the marriage tax but the democrats through their leadership and through the president put it back on the board in their opinion marriage is a taxable event and the presidents veto he vetoed our process to eliminate the marriage tax and the president put it back on the middle class of america primarily by the way the middle class pays in my opinion the biggest portion of taxes in this country the middle class represents quantitywise the largest number of workers that is what you are doing when the president and the democratic policy my colleagues here when you put that marriage tax back on after we passed the bill to eliminate it that is who you are taxing and you are taxing our young people with our young people we are trying to encourage marriage we are trying to tell the young people and boy it is promising we have some wonderful wonderful people in the generation behind us all of us know that but is this the way to encourage that generation there is another tax we took a look at and said fundamentally is it fair to tax death the simple fact that somebody dies is that a fair tax is that a taxable event is that an event that our forefathers ever imagined in the constitution would be the basis of this price that we go to our taxpayers and say we want you to pay this price to be a citizen in this country is death a taxable event that the middle class pay and do not kid yourself it affects every class in society the democrats like to say well it is only the rich they like to play this class warfare it is not class warfare you take money regardless of how many people are in the community take a community with 5 000 people who have a person that has to pay the estate taxes say a contractor or anybody a contractor that owns a dump truck a bulldozer and a couple of pickups they are subject to the death tax you go to those people and you take it out of the community and you transfer that money right here to these chambers in washington d c you are transferring money from local communities out in the united states out beyond the potomac and you are transferring it here so it affects every class so the fundamental question of fairness that is an obligation we have regardless of whether we have a surplus or not now it so happens we do have a surplus but regardless of whether we have a surplus or not should we tax the event of death we said no the republicans said no and by the way some democrats joined us they also said we should not tax death we sent that bill to the president the president vetoed it he put it back on the president said death is a taxable event and by the way i sit on the committee on ways and means i know what the presidents budget is the presidents proposal this year was not only do not eliminate the death tax he has actually proposed in his budget to increase the death tax by 9 5 billion so the democratic policy and the presidents policy and again not getting personal here but look there is a difference and the american people we need to talk about these differences they want to keep the death tax in place not all of them but most of the democratic leadership they want to add 9 5 billion according to the presidents new policy on taxes we think that has gone too far now there are some taxes that we have been able to persuade that the republican leadership has come forward with and has been able to put into the tax code it is surprising how many of our constituents out there do not know that this congress the republican congress passed a tax reduction that probably is the most significant tax break that any individual out there who owns a home has probably had in their career what am i talking about very briefly let us take a look what i want my colleagues to do is if any of my colleagues in here have constituents who own homes at every town meeting they go to they should ask their constituents how many of them own homes my guess is and it is an exciting thing most of the people in the audience will own homes what is great about this country is our homeownership when i was younger one expected to own their first home when they were approaching 30 now this new generation is able to buy homes at a much earlier age and it is an american dream what we found happening what we talked about our republican leadership and our philosophy was look it is unfair to tax these young especially younger families who own a home and they sell their home we hit them with a huge capital gains tax what the old law was the law that we wanted to change it said quite simply look if an american sells a house for a net profit they make a net profit and we will take an example here here is an individual let us say an individual bought a home for 100 000 they sold the home for 350 000 and they had a profit of 250 000 under the old law they were taxed they had income of 250 000 we thought what we want to do one of the things kind of like marriage we encourage our younger generation to get married we want our younger generation also to enjoy the economic benefits of homeownership so what we decided to do and it was the republican leadership that did it frankly and i do not mind look i know i am standing up here saying republican and democrat a lot but we need to talk about this bill and who stood up when it was time to stand up i was surprised in the last couple of weeks i thought the death tax was pretty nonpartisan we had a lot of democrats that joined our leadership in trying to do away with it but a lot of them walked we had a lot of democrats who joined many joined to get rid of the marriage tax but they walked so i think it is important for us to have discussions because there are differences what the republicans felt we made a proposal if an individual buys the home same example 100 000 same example 350 000 250 000 profit under our bill they will be taxed zero and this passed this passed and for couples the news is even better for couples it in essence doubles if you own a home in the united states and you sell that home for a net profit not your equity in the home you may buy a home for 100 000 you pay down 50 000 of it you only own 50 000 that balance is equity i am talking about net profit say a young couple buys a house and sells the house for a profit what our bill does and it was signed into law so it is now the law they get to take that profit they get to put that money into their pocket no taxes up to 250 000 per person or 500 000 per couple that is significant that makes a big difference that is tax policy that i think makes good sense in the last few days i have heard people especially with the politics going around people saying well tax cuts are bad all the republicans want are tax cuts i think that what we want is a fairness in the tax code i would bet anything that we would have a hard time finding a young couple go pick a 21yearold male or female college student or a 21yearold male or female that is working in a blue collar job and ask them do you think it is fundamentally wrong for one party wanting to advocate for changes in the tax code that would bring more fairness to the tax code that would be an incentive to couples your age or single mothers to have the opportunity to buy a home of course they would agree with that that is what the republican leadership is talking about george w bush and his campaign in the last month or 6 weeks has been talking about these tax reductions he is not talking about going out and picking out the wealthiest people of the country he is across the board read any analysis out there why because of the fairness of the tax code when we are fairer to income producers our income producers produce more income that is just a fundamental law let us talk about some other taxes that we have had capital gains for example it used to be the old democratic argument was that capital gains is only for the rich for many years i think the democrats were probably right on that because there were periods of time in our country where the only people who ever worried abo4t paying capital gains taxation were the wealthy now i am not one who believes in class warfare and i say that to my colleagues i think over the long run class warfare is not what the american system is about that is not what has made the american system great but the fact is we did at one point in time decades ago decades ago have one segment of our society that only benefited from capital gains but what has happened in the last 10 or 15 years we have lots more people investing in land we have a lot of people in the lowerincome brackets who own their homes we have a lot of people whose employer or on their own or through their employer have gone into 401 k plans or they are invested in mutual funds now all of the sudden a much broader population faces capital gains taxation and yet we cannot get the democratic leadership it was very difficult to get them to come to our side to reduce that taxation the reduction of that taxation was not just a reduction in taxation to the wealthy it came across the board and finally they admitted it but now the rhetoric that i have heard the last couple of weeks because the elections are coming up is that any consideration of a tax code revision or a tax cut such as marriage tax get rid of it or the death tax get rid of it or capital gains or elimination of the taxes on the profit of the sale of your home some of my colleagues on the left the liberal aspect act as if we are going to ruin the budget act as if that is what led to the deficit remember in my opinion i think a fair tax code is a conservative approach i think a fair tax code is a moderate approach but i do not think a fair tax code is a liberal approach i think the liberal approach is bringing the money any way you can that money belongs in washington d c it ought to be spent in washington d c as a collective benefit for the country or for people to take the individual responsibilities move those individual responsibilities to washington d c and fund it as a collective issue i disagree fundamentally with that policy and so do a lot of american people but i think we have kind of disclosures in truth when we go out and speak to our constituents i think we have an obligation when we go out there and say look tax cuts is a very broad term let us talk specifically what we mean when we talk about tax cuts we are talking about things like the capital gains tax issue we are talking about things like elimination of the death tax we are talking about things like the marriage penalty we are talking about the fact why do we go to our young people of whom we have an obligation to act in a responsible manner for their future why do we go to them and penalize them for being married when in fact we encourage them to be married those are policies that i think are fair game because they are fair on their face so i hope that my colleagues as they go out there during this election process that they take the time to talk to some and by the way not just the young people the policies for the taxes of the young but take a look as well at what we the republican leadership did the moderate approach did for our seniors we not only talked about the death tax issue we not only talked about the marriage penalty we not only reduced the capital gains taxation under republican leadership we not only eliminated the taxation up to 250 000 when we sell our home out here in america but we also went to the seniors and said we have discovered another thing that is unfair with our tax code we are finding out just because of the fact you are between the years 65 and 69 we are going to penalize you on your social security if you hold a job outside of your home where is the fairness of that for years it was like pulling teeth from the liberal contingents from the liberals it was like pulling their teeth to get them to admit that that was unfair to seniors finally this year frankly because of some good editorials written across this country the liberal segment of our politics back here conceded and gave in on that and we passed that into law i commend the moderates on this floor and i commend the conservatives on this floor that were able to see that earnings limitation on social security trashed and i also want to say even though we did not get it passed because the president vetoed it and by the way it is the vice presidents policy as well i still commend my colleagues for stepping forward and standing up to the fact that death is not a taxable event and that should have been thrown out the window that marriage is not a taxable event and that should have been thrown out the window we need to have fairness and we can talk about income tax bracketing as well but the fact is we have an obligation a fiduciary obligation to the taxpayers and to the citizens of this country to have a tax code that is fair let me move on to another area one of my favorite areas social security first of all i want to tell about what the government does for its employees and i am one of those employees i hear a lot of course out there on the campaign trail or when i am out there in my town meetings i go back to my district every weekend my district is larger that the state of florida i put about 50 000 miles a year in my district in the car i listen to people i stop at the coffee stop a lot of people do not realize that government employees have almost essentially the same type of retirement plan in addition to social security we also have social security congress for example i saw somebody email me the other day that they got something off the internet that congressmen do not have to pay social security of course we pay social security but we have got about 2 or 3 million government employees on a system that is very similar to the system that george w bush has proposed i am amazed i am amazed of the number of my colleagues who are trashing george w bushs proposal on social security when in fact on the other hand we live within a policy or a program here provided for all government employees that is almost identical to what he is proposing what is it it is called personal choice let me explain very briefly how the government program works the government program works this way every government employee has an amount of money taken out of their pay to provide for their retirement it is an amount of money that they have no choice of how it is spent or where it is invested on the other hand while they have no voice or input as to what happens with that they also get a guaranteed retirement after they put in a certain amount of years and turn alcertain age and after they vest they get a certain guaranteed retirement they have a safety net there it is not a lot but it is there and it is funded by the amount of money that they have drawn out of their check we as government employees all 3 million of us have drawn out of our check but there is a second program in addition to social security and that program is called the thrift savings program what that allows government employees to do such as myself i am allowed as are 3 million other federal employees we are allowed to by personal choice take an amount money up to 10 percent of our pay and we are allowed to invest that in the thrift savings program and the federal government will match it up to the first 5 percent they will match the first 5 percent although we are entitled to put in 10 percent and we get a choice you can put it in a risky fund like the stock market although the higher the risk the higher the return we can put it in a safer fund or we can put it in a guaranteed savings fund which haslow return but almost zero risk li 2200 we have that right to make that choice but it is only with 10 percent of our income so we never overstep or never get in over our heads so to speak on the amount of money that we put in and we personally get to choose how to invest it do you know how many people in the federal government participate in that program a very very high percentage i would bet that every one of my colleagues sitting here on the floor participates in that program participates in choice why can we not do that for social security if it is good for us why is it not good for the rest of america if it is good for us our system the thrift savings plan works why is not george w bushs plan good for the rest of america i know that some people have said this kind of policy is a risky policy risky we have tried it and we tested it and the government employees like it they get involved ii it they get personal choice that is the avenue that all of us should approach in trying to figure out how to rehabilitate the social security system now as you know our social security system there are some factors that put it into trouble i mean we know that in 1935 for every worker that was retired every person that was retired in 1935 when social security came in we had 42 workers 42 workers over here providing for that 1 person that is retired today for every person that is retired we only have 3 workers providing for them because we have so many people retired back then in 1935 the average person lived to about i do not know it was probably 61 i think for men and 65 somewhere in that range today it is pushing the 80s people are living longer that is good news but it also puts more of a burden on social security and as a result of that while social security is cashrich in other words on a cash flow basis the money coming in today our social security is in the black the fact is on an actuarial basis the basis of which we look into the future and say can social security make it on that basis social securitys bankrupt so what do we do first of all if we are going to make changes in social security we have to do what george w bush has proposed and what a number of us support very strongly that is one we have to guarantee that the people like for example my age and the generation ahead of me are not going to lose their benefits they are not there is nobody on social security today or nobody from age 40 or above say for example that is going to have their benefits threatened the social security benefits will be there and do not let the liberals use the fear tactics of telling you that we cannot be bold in social security that we should not try something new that we ought to stay with the same old thing even though it is not working in the long run we have to have some kind of assurance to the workers presently in the later stages of their career that your benefits are okay i am telling you the generation the x generation or the younger generation whatever you want to call them these people are bright people they are energetic people they want choice more than ever in the history of this country this generation following us wants independence and they are bright enough to handle it they have experience in business they want to have choice they want to be able to choose they want to choose more than ever whether they live in the country or here they want to choose whether their kids go to public school or private school i think george w bush has hit the button right on the top of it this generation this young generation wants to make some choice in social security we have a plan that is tried true and tried so to speak right here we are part of it what is the opposition to going to the social security and putting that into effect the same kind of plan that every one on the floor of the house of representatives and almost three million other federal employees enjoy it works i think we ought to try it i will tell my colleagues the biggest mistake we can make here and biggest misservice we can do to our constituents here is to sit idle look this is election time in the next 4 weeks 5 weeks or 6 weeks we are going to have a lot of political rhetoric but the minute that goes by in 6 weeks i think we have an obligation to step up to the plate and do it get it done get this train back on course now i think there is always going to be a disagreement between what i would call moderate and conservative on economics and the liberal philosophy the liberal philosophy in my opinion has a huge safety net that takes care of everybody and does it on a collective basis now i am not sure how they pay for it but they feel that the responsibility"], [0.9999527931213379, 0.9999527931213379, 0, "today i would like to speak on an issue which i have indeed spoken about before but i have some startling new information for the american people it is no surprise to anyone that i am deeply concerned about americas relationship with communist china in this body we have votes on the trading status with communist china and this administration is operating under policy guidelines that deal with communist china in a certain way in fact the united states congress the house of representatives and the senate have voted for normal trade relations or what used to be called mostfavorednation status for china and a majority of members of this body on my side of the aisle have voted to treat communist china in terms of our trade relations as we do normal trade relations with other societies that of course with a largenumber of people on the other side supporting mostfavorednation status normal trade relations as well the clinton administration has gone beyon l this perhaps those of us in this house believe that trading relations with another country even a dictatorship like that on the mainland of china will in some way help that society evolve into a more peaceful more benevolent more democratic situation i consider that to be wishful thinking i disagree with that concept i personally believe in free trade between free people and it is better to give dictatorships and people who live under dictatorships the incentive to reform and the incentive to move towards democracy rather than giving them the fruits of a positive trade relationship with this the strongest economy in the world i would treat communist china differently than i would treat the government of belgium or italy or other democratic societies in trying to determine what our trade policy should be again this is based on wishful thinking however it is beyond my realm and my ability to understand how this administration has been able to move forward with its policies toward communist china over these last 6 years the president of the united states has insisted time and again that communist china be considered a strategic partner of the united states those are the words that this administration has insisted upon communist china a strategic partner of the united states a few moments ago we pledged our allegiance to the flag of the united states of america our flag as i noted before we said the pledge stands for freedom and justice how can a country which is based not on some ethnic background as our country has no ethnicity that we are supposedly protecting as in other countries their national identity stems from that from an ethnic or racial homogeny among the people but we have no religious belief that binds all of our people together in fact we have every race and every ethnic group from every part of tha world people who have come here to america and we have every religion in america what binds americans together is our love of liberty and our love of justice and our love of freedom that is the foundation that is the basis of our country how can we if we believe that to be true consider the worlds worst human rights abuser as our strategic partner yes having a trading relationship with a dictatorship such as china is wishful thinking it is also exploitation on the part of various business interests in the united states business interests that i might add could care less about the working people in our country often closing up factories here in order to set up factories in china in order to sell the products that were made in china back here in the united states because we have such a low tariff on chinese goods although the chinese tariff on our goods is very high but if we stand for freedom and justice how can we have not just a trading relationship but a strategic partnership with communist china it is my contention that this nonsense this almost surrealistic policy on the part of the clinton administration has already yielded a horrible bounty of threats and jeopardy to the united states of america let me make this very clear the clinton policy of treating communist china as a friend as a benevolent country as a strategic partner has resulted in putting the united states in grave danger there are two things that i will talk about today first i have spoken about this before and it is well known in the public although it is being denied through the liberal media over and over and over again now and that is the weapons and technology of mass destruction that communist china has managed to obtain because of our lax policies towards the communist china regime and number two i would like to speak today about dramatic information that i have uncovered in panama during a recent trip to panama i spent time investigating the situation spoke to people who were in hiding who were afraid for their lives spoke to others who were firsthand observers of corruption and firsthand observers of a strategic maneuver on the part of the chinese that is moving forward and putting the united states in great danger so i will be speaking first about the technology and missiles that have found their way and been upgraded the chinese missiles that have been upgraded with american technology and then i would like to talk a little bit about what i discovered in panama it is most disturbing to me that after 2 years we still have press reports from the likes of bob scheerer of the los angeles times and why the los angeles times feels that it has to always tout the far left line i do not know i do not understand that i do not understand how a major newspaper in the united states can continually take the side of those leftwing regimes and downplay any threat to the united states that these leftwing regimes around the world pose to the united states of america but now mr scheerer in the l a times and others in the media and this administration through an orchestrated maneuvering is trying to suggest that there was no validity to the cox report and that the chinese really have not through underhanded means obtained information that permits them to develop weapons of mass destruction that threaten millions of americans this i assert today is a truism over the last 7 years the communist chinese have been able to obtain and start putting into their weapons systems technology that cost the american people the american taxpayer billions of dollars to develop the communist chinese have been able to use american technology to leapfrog ahead by decades farther ahead than what they would be if it was not for the fact that they had american technology at their disposal which permits them to build weapons of mass destruction that threaten every american city that threaten tens of millions of americans with nuclear incineration they have atomic weapons that are based on american technology and they obtained them from the united states in some way i would say today that the american people need to pay attention i would alert the american people that something is wrong with the taxpayer dollars that they have spent by the billions which are now being put in the hands of people like those who are in charge of the regime in beijing the communist chinese regime thbere is something wrong when those billions of dollars that we spent during the cold war now find their way the technology that was developed finds its way to a power like communist china and no amount of words it is hard to even describe the process of the mangling of the language and word games that is being played by this administration in order to call china our strategic partner to call communist china the worlds worst human rights abuser our strategic partner 0i 1015 this has resulted in several things number one this body had to act on its h8378own to force the clinton administration to discontinue military exchange programs with the communist chinese regime let us make this very clear communist china is the worlds worst human rights abuser it is a communist dictatorship their leadership still claims to their own communist congresses in beijing that the united states is the enemy and that they will destroy us but yet we have had a policy in the last 5 years of military exchanges in which we are teaching them our military secrets and we permit their top military brass to observe our troops and how they act and the game plans that we use during our warfare our potential warfare with any adversary at the same time we have been taking these military exchange programs and what have we been doing we have been teaching the communist chinese how to run a logistics system how to supply troops in the field how to transport troops this we are doing with the military of the worlds worst human rights abuser a country that threatens our own national security what sense does that make the people of tibet are still suffering under a genocidal policy by the communist re gime in beijing there are muslims in the far reaches of western china who are also suffering a genocidal attack believers in god christians who refuse to register with the government are being brutally suppressed thrown into concentration camps they call it the laogai system of prisons now we hear that a buddhist sect made up of middleaged and senior citizens of china who practice nothing more than kind of a breathing exercise an exercise program in the morning that helps the soul as well as the body even this little buddhist religious sect is now coming under severe repression this is not a normal regime this is not like belgium or the netherlands or even mexico which is struggling to try to have free elections there are no free elections there are no parties there is no freedom in china but yet we are training the military in china on how to be more effective and what will that military do it will either be used to repress their own people and participate in destroying the culture and the people of tibet or these other repressed minorities in china or it will be used in aggression against their neighbors already burma has become nothing more than a fiefdom for china we see in the spratly islands the communist chinese trying to bully their neighbors and grab these islands so that they can control the malacca straits where so much of the worlds commerce goes through that one little strait there in south asia they may use that military training that we are providing them in that type of activity or they may use the military training that we are providing them to kill americans this is insanity it is an insane policy to call this type of regime our strategic partner and it is threatening the lives and the wellbeing of millions of americans every time we turn around we are finding out that our country is more in jeopardy because of conscious decisions on the part of the clinton administration to treat communist china as a benevolent power this is not only insanity this is a crime against the american people especially against the youth of our country the american people who are trying to raise their family sacrificed america sacrificed during the cold war america sacrificed in order to make a more peaceful world and to protect the cause of human freedom and yet now with the cold war over we are finding that our young people our children are going to be in as great a danger 10 years from now as they were at the height of the cold war why is that because we have a policy that makes no sense that is contrary to our interests in dealing with a regime on the mainland of china that hates everything that the united states stands for let me make this clear about the regime that controls the mainland of china these are gangsters these are people who hate the united states of america because they believe that we are the only power that standsin their way of their destiny just as japan during the 1920s believed that it was the destiny of japan to control all of asia and into the pacific basin the japanese knew that the united states was the only power that stood in their way that we were the only ones that could stop them from their destiny these militaristic gangsters who ran japan at the time that same attitude now is what we find in beijing when we let their scientists go to our laboratories when we train their military they do not say oh the united states of america must be our friends otherwise they would not be so open they are not saying that they are saying the united states of america is weak they are saying that the people of the united states of america are permitting weapons technology to come into our possession and we hate them that must mean the americans are cowards that is what is going on we are laying the foundation for a bitter future for our young people because 10 years from now when the communist chinese have taken the technology that they have stolen from us and obtained through our openness with them they will be put into weapons systems that will threaten the lives of our young people when they reach adulthood and sometime and someday in the future we will send an aircraft carrier into the pacific and thousands of american lives will be lost if we get into a confrontation because the chinese will have the technology to sink our aircraft carriers and murder our military personnel and when we look back we will find that that technology was developed by the american taxpayers during the cold war and offered on a plate to the communist chinese this is a sinful policy it is sinful because it ignores the fundamental values of our country and it is sinful because we the government and we are the government the united states of america we the people we are supposed to be watching out for the peoples interest especially the interest of future generations of americans this acknowledgment of the type of technological disaster that we are in right now started 2 years ago as chairman of the subcommittee on space and aeronautics which is my primary responsibility here in the house of representatives i went to a meeting of aerospace workers to find out what projects they are working on and to get a firsthand look and feel for our aerospace industry in the united states during that meeting one of the employees of the aerospace industry that i was talking to was talking about the project that he had just been involved in he had just come back from china he was saying congressman those chinese rockets they do not even work they do not have rightstage separation technology we are trying to put our satellites up with those rockets and they will not work and they can only carry one payload they can only carry one satellite so i have spent the last year over there helping them try and correct these problems i could not believe what i was hearing finally when he was done i said let me get this straight your company has used this technology that we paid for that the taxpayers paid for you are using that technology and your expertise and your company every means that your company has to improve the capability and the reliability of the rocket systems over in china he says why yes their stage separation he repeated that they do not have the exploding bolts the stage separation that they need and they blow up right after it takes off i looked at that aerospace worker and i said you know i think it is a good thing when communist chinese rockets blow up and all of a sudden he said oh you are thinking about th6 national security implications and i said yes yes i am i am thinking about that it is something we should think about he said do not worry we have a waiver from the white house well that made me feel real good about that i spent the next 6 months researching this issue i went to the major aerospace firms and talked to them i went to the subcontractors i went to the aerospace employees and i researched this issue myself before i made a speech on the floor of the house of representatives what i found was a verification that our companies some of our major corporations were over in china providing them with the technology they needed to make sure their rockets did not explode when the stages separated to make sure that the rockets in china could carry more than one payload when we are talking about payloads we are not just talking about a peaceful satellite here if you can carry more than one satellite you can carry more than one warhead more than one warhead means if they send a missile to the united states that does not explode because the stage separation now works with american technology that it can carry two atomic bombs or three or four and wipe out tens of millions of people in the united states rather than just a million people this was not a secret to this administration that this was going on in fact when alarm bells went off this administration put their thumb right on top of those civil servants throughout the administration who were supposed to be watching put for our security we found that especially to be true in how this administration has been running our national laboratories for those who do not understand we have laboratories where we have developed these weapons of mass destruction that can either be used to protect freedom and preserve the peace or if that technology gets into the hands of monsters like hitler or the militaristic japanese or the communist chinese regime in beijing those weapons would threaten humankind because china has to be told that they are our strategic partner we had a policy of letting these scientists from the peoples republic of china do their experiments in our laboratories in our weapons laboratories over and over again we have found during this investigation we have found that those people who sounded the alarm career civil servants civil service people were repressed by this administration were told to shut up or get out we have had hearings on this and documented this over and over again now what has this resulted in what are we talking about here we are talking about missile technology and we are talking about technology that has permitted them to build weapons that can kill millions of americans probably the size of that little desk down there that little table right there put into a chinese rocket that can kill millions of americans or millions of tibetans or millions of japanese or millions of south koreans that technology has been taken obtained from the united states from our scientists and now is in the hands of a regime that is in the middle of committing genocide in tibet repressing their own people and involved in a great military expansion a country that is being provided by our own policies with 50 to 60 billion of hard currency surplus because we are permitting them the trade status of a benevolent friendly country we will pay dearly for this nonsense our young people will face a threat that they should not have to face because of this indefensible totally indefensible policy but it is worse after my investigation into the original charges about the use of technology to upgrade and to perfect communist chinese rockets the gentleman from california mr cox and the gentleman from washington mr dicks were made the heads of a select committee and they conducted their own investigation with people with much more expertise than i have specialists went in and confirmed this horrible horrible transfer of technology to the communist chinese aid now the clinton administration and the news media is trying to get the american people to relax forget about it pretend it does not exist in fact robert scheerer of the l a times is trying to claim it never happened yes the communist chinese just simply found the plans for the w88 warhead atomic warhead they found those plans under their pillow one night because the tooth fairy must have left it there i am sure that is what must have happened it was either the tooth fairy or it was a policy by this administration that ended up with a transfer of that technology the american people can decide which one of those scenarios actually happened by the way this is not the first time such things have happened there have been transfers of technology in the past there are reports that in the 1930s howard hughes designed a fighter aircraft that was a superior fighter aircraft for its day and that our government did not follow through on his offer to produce these fighter aircraft the story is that the japanese got a hold of the blueprints for that and howard hughes was the one who actually designed the japanese zero which resulted in the death of so many americans during world war ii i do not know if that is true i have heard that report over and over again it may not be true but we do know that hughes electronics certainly is one of the companies that has been involved in transferring rocket technology to the communist chinese in order to perfect their rocket systems also some people do not know that during the postwar period after world war h the english decided to prove to josef stalin that they were his friends and so the english shipped to joe stalin this bloody dictator in russia they shipped to him a complete rolls royce jet engine which at that time was the utmost that was the ultimate in all weapons technology a jet engine for an airplane know what that did not make josef stalin any more benevolent it did not make josef stalin more inclined to trust the west and become more democratic and open no josef stalin used that jet engine that rolls royce jet engine not to build passenger planes that could help tie russia with the rest of the world josef stalin used that rolls royce engine which was copied every little bit of it and mass produced in russia he used it in the mig fighters that shot down american planes in korea josef stalin launched a war in korea and used the technology that the english had given him to produce airplanes that we could not shoot down and thousands of american lives were lost because of it the british just thought that they were trying to do something that would prove that they were friendly when will the free people of the world understand that when dealing with a gangster or a bully or a dictator we must do so from strength or that dictator will perceive a weakness the communist chinese regime is no more benevolent no more peaceful today in fact there are signs that it has become worse in these last 10 years with all due respect to my colleagues in this body that vote for most favored nation status over and over again i think the communist chinese would have to bomb the capitol of the united states before they would quit voting to provide this very lucrative trade status to the communist chinese regime and the chinese continue as i say their aggressive action about 6 months ago i flew over the spratly islands it took me 2 years to get to the spratly islands because our state department did not want me to see what was going on there what was going on there the chinese communists are taking the islands these islands are just about 100 miles off the philippines yet they are 800 miles off the coast of china and the chinese communists are building fortifications when i finally got out to the spratly islands i was in an old c130 an old propellerdriven airplane that the philippine air force provided me and as soon as we got through the clouds there were three chinese war ships right there in the lagoon of which is one of the spratly islands not only were there three chinese war ships but the chinese construction workers were feverishly trying to complete a fortification on those islands we could see their welding torches even as our plane dipped down to take a low pass over those islands we could see the torches at work and they were building their fortifications this is very similar very similar to the situation in the 1920s and 1930s when the japanese fortified the pacific islands and in this case the chinese are trying to grab these islands from the philippines a democratic country with very little military trying to grab these islands in order to what in order to bracket the water passages between the mainland of china and the spratly islands which will then give them a strangle hold on 50 percent of the commerce of asia a strangle hold and also a grip on americas ability to defend asia something else is going on right now and this is where i would like to lead in to my talk on panama the communist chinese regime is also involved in a strategic maneuver here is our strategic partner involved in a strategic maneuver one would think if they were our strategic partner that maneuver would be something that we would like because they are our partners are they not no they are involved in a strategic maneuver to strangle the united states of america and it is very clear that they have targeted areas in which the united states is most vulnerable the panama canal happens to be one of those areas let me make clear panama is where the two major oceans of the world come together the pacific and the atlantic oceans it is where the two great continents of the western hemisphere come together the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere this is one of the choke points of the world this and the suez canal and the straits of gibralter this and the molucca straits near the spratly islands what do we find what do we find we find that the united states of america has removed all of its military personnel from panama i was down as i say in panama a very short time ago a month ago and i was shocked to see ghost towns in what had been only a short time ago american military bases panama of course has no military of their own they have no military and they have always relied on the united states military to protect the canal against any type of aggression so when i traveled to panama and having been there many times in the past and seen many american military persons there to protect panama and protect our national security interests and protect the canal i was shocked when i saw they were gone they are all gone it is like this hall of congress now i am the only member standing here when one goes down to panama where there used to be tens of thousands of american troops navy air force marines army they were always there they are gone and there is no panamanian military force to take up the slack now what does that mean to us well that means to us that there is a vulnerability there there are two vulnerabilities number one there is a war going on next door in colombia and already the narco terrorists who are allied with fidel castro and the people who hate the united states already those guerrillas have infiltrated into the panamanian military there is nothing standing between them and the panama canal that alone should cause alarm bells to go off because the panama canal is vulnerable to sabotage i will not go into detail but it is incredibly vulnerable to sabotage what concerns me more is the overwhelming evidence of a chinese presence and even domination of panama in the panama canal something that is in the process of happening that to me was even more frightening because i know that we can blink our eyes and this magnificent achievement of the united states a canal between the two oceans something that we rely on in times of international emergency so we can send our ships from one ocean to the other and take off days actually a week of travel around the horn in south america that that panama canal now is totally vulnerable and is slowly coming under the domination of the communist chinese now let me say what i mean there is a company called hutchison whampoa run by a man named li kashing he is part of the clique he is part of beijings inner circle he is a front man and his company is a front for the chinese government the chinese government in fact owns over 30 percent outright of his company this company is tied not closely but tied totally within the small circle of elite of the beijing regime this company now has won the contract which provides them control of all of the port facilities on both ends of the canal now to be fair about it there are some other new port facilities further away that are being built but on both ends of the canal directly outside of the canal those port facilities are now under control of this communist chinese front cdmpany now how did that happen and what does that mean when i went to panama the first thing i did was try to go down to those areas that are now under lease arrangement by the way it is not a 10year lease not a 25year lease the lease is giving them up to 50 years of control of these strategic positions on both sides of the canal by the way the lease agreement also gives them concessions on certain ways of how the panama canal will be run the piloting of the ships et cetera they are also in negotiations and are trying to and i am not sure if this is part of the lease or not to get control of one of the air bases in panama the howard air base as well as some of the other military facilities that we left behind now how did that happen what has gone wrong here what is happening how can a country that is considered to be belligerent and many people are trying to have a realistic policy considered to be belligerent and hostile to the united states end up with a commanding position in the panama canal and a position to dominate this strategic waterway how did that happen where was our intelligence where was the nsa who were they listening to where was the cia i think the cia and the nsa probably did their job the trouble is that they are reporting to the clinton administration and everywhere in the world where we look where americas national security has been put in jeopardy by the communist chinese the fingerprints of the clinton administration are all over the crime scene the people who are supposed to be protecting our interests are not protecting our national security interests so i went down and i met with the ambassador the ambassador to panama from the united states i asked the ambassador i said mr ambassador how did they get this contract i said in fact i have even heard that there might have been some bribery involved here he says oh we do not know if there is any corruption involved in this i said what do your intelligence reports say he said what intelligence reports i said what does the nsa say when they are listening in on the conversations involved with the people involved in these negotiations well i do not know i have not seen those reports if there are any what does your station chief the head of the cia there what does he say i have not seen any report by him this is the most important thing that has happened in the past 10 years in panama and the ambassador has not bothered to read the intelligence reports of how that contract came into being so i said well mr ambassador this is really an important thing do you not think you ought to check up on it and he says oh i guess maybe i should well come to find out that there are certain people who work for the government whose job is not to see any evil not to go looking for those reports our ambassador to panama happens to have been who it happens to have been the man who was the chairman of president clintons reelection campaign in florida the last time around i am not saying that he has done anything corrupt or wrong i am just saying that he has not looked at these intelligence reports and he is a political appointee who is highly politically involved with the presidents personal political ambitions somebody is not watching out for the national security interests of the united states so i went out after meeting the ambassador by the way the cia station chief was conveniently not available when i was in panama conveniently not available so i went out to try to find things on my own i am sorry to reporttoday to my colleagues and to whoever is listening or reading the that i was able to find out information that has indicated to me that the lease arrangement the contract arrangement with this communist chinese front company was obtained through bribery of highlevel panamanian officials i talked to people who were directly involved with the negotiations directly involved with the bidding process and i was told and these people are afraid to say so publicly but they told me privately that there were bribes in the millions of dollars that were paid to the former president of panama balladares for the lease agreement with the hutchison whampoa company and it was again repeated to me over and over again that hutchison whampoa did not offer the best bid for those port facilities on either side of the panama canal yet they were awarded that lease agreement and the only explanation is that millions of dollars of bribes were provided to highlevel panamanian officials president balladares who was president at the time and recently stepped down it is important for us to note that the panamanian constitution prevents a president of panama from running for reelection president balladares wanted to change the constitution so that he could run for reelection the chinese certainly bankrolled that campaign and guess who was down there running the referendum to try to change the panamanian constitution so this man who helped give away the panama canal would have the right to run again for office who was down there running that campaign for him james carville that is who who is he every time you turn around the presidents inner circle is involved with something that is undercutting americas national security i am recommending to our colleagues that we pay attention to panama up until now the reason these things are happening is that we have left it to the administration and panama has been off of the radar screen of the united states of america it cannot be if we let foreign policy be the purview only of the government and only of the executive branch our country will suffer as it has been put in great jeopardy by our relations with communist china just one other note when i went to panama the head of the panamanian cia that is their central intelligence agency was in hiding her name was samantha smith samantha smith was in hiding and our embassy did not know where she was they did not know what was happening how to get hold of her there was no report on samantha smith of how we could talk to her the head of the panamanian cia was in hiding for this reason because there had been information that she had been involved in a smuggling ring of communist chinese aliens chinese residents of the mainland of china who had paid 30 000 a head to president balladares of panama in order to go through panama into the united states of america hundreds of them this woman the head of the cia was the one who signed off on this operation but she had signed off on it because her president had ordered her to sign those documents those requests from these chinese coming from the mainland first of all i want to know who these people were who these chinese were who could afford to pay 30 000 to be smuggled into the united states through panama chinese farmers do not have that kind of money i do not know if they are saboteurs i do not know who they are but i want to know who they are the head of the panamanian cia when she realized she was going to be the fall person she was going to be blamed when this became known went into hiding guess what our our embassy just could not find her they had not had contact with her but guess what within one day i found her within one day i had a meeting with this head of their panamanian intelligence she just told me everything about how the president had forced her to sign these documents ordered her even above her objection and how these chinese would come in these illegal chinese would come in land in panama and there would be a special escort officer that would take them on the second floor at the airport in panama and take them around and then take them where she did not know and how she had protested to the president but the president of panama balladares had ordered her to do so this is the man who also fascinatingly enough provided the contract for hutchison whampoa the chinese front company that now controls both ends of the canal let me tell the members something that i consider to be even another little bit of evidence that we should not miss supposedly our government has been negotiating with the panamanian government the government of balladares for what we have been negotiating to try to maintain some type of military presence in panama to protect the panama canal polls indicate now that from 70 to 80 percent of the panamanian people love the united states and want to see a military presence of the united states in panama we left they told us to leave and we left now they know we have been serious all these years that we believe they have the right and freedom to control their own country we are not like russia china if the people do not want us we do not stay there and brutalize the people in order to maintain our military bases we got out that just reconfirmed for the people of panama hey the americans are good people after all they really do believe in democracy we want them back although the polls showed 70 to 80 percent of the panamanian people wanted us there our state department could not negotiate a contract and a deal that would permit us an agreement that would permit us to have an american military presence in panama they could not do it something is wrong something is wrong here of course it was president balladares who was the head of that country and of course our own ambassador had not read any of the intelligence reports i do not guess he has read any intelligence reports on any instructions balladares might have had with those negotiators or any contact that he might have with the communist chinese all i know is we are depending on an administration to defend our country to make sure our children are not put in jeopardy and that administration is treating the communist chinese as a strategic partner and we are being put in danger we have to reverse this situation it is up to the congress of the united states to act and it is up to the american people to demand action and to get involved in this process if we want our children to be safe we cannot do so by giving the communist chinese leverage on future generations of americans we will not be safe if the communist chinese have weapons based on american technology that could murder tens of millions of our people that is not the kind of world we want to leave our children in 10 years that is the kind of world they are going to have unless we act the first step we have to quit treating communist china as a friend and be realistic i am not saying we should go to war with them we should not but we must be tough and we must be strong and we must demand a trade relationship that is mutually beneficial and certainly not one that gives them 70 billion in hard currency and puts the american people out of work i am introducing legislation today and i have approximately 25 cosponsors at this time i am introducing legislation now i ask people to call their congressman to join the resolution the panama resolution offered by the gentleman from california mr roarabacher that is me i am asking them to call their members of congress and ask them to join me in a resolution that does three things in panama number one it asks the new government that defeated the balladares regime president moscoso who is a woman a wonderful person and a ray of hope for the united states government that we do our best and we call on president moscoso to cancel this lease with this chinese front company cancel it and to investigate how that lease came about that is what we are asking the president of panama to do in this resolution we are asking also that the united states move forward with an investigation as well as with the government of panama into these charges of corruption on how that lease was issued in the first place when they cancel this lease we are asking that they institute a new system that is open and fair and transparent as they say so there will be honest bidding for those port facilities in the panama canal also we should investigate how that last contract happened number three we should negotiate with this new government in panama president moscoso some type of arrangement where we can work together with panama for the security of panama and also the security of the panama canal these are things that we need to do it is part of my resolution as a sense of congress we are calling for those things i would hope that all of my colleagues come back here next week and that we get a number of cosponsors on this and that this moves through the system very rapidly we need to send a message to this administration to the people of panama and to the communist chinese that congress will not permit the security interests of the united states to be jeopardied because of some fantasy by the president that we are in a strategic partnership with the communist regime in beijing i would like to leave people with this one thought my father was a marine pilot he was a 20year career man a lieutenant colonel when i was a young boy we lived in japan and my father flew intelligence missions along the chinese coast we lived in a small compound outside of iwakuni japan which is a navy base there my father would fly along with other pilots right along the coast and photograph the coast of china this is in the 1950s he did so at great personal risk in fact my nextdoor neighbor this is when i was 10 years old my nextdoor neighbor was shot down by a communist chinese plane thank god that that person was not shot down and murdered by the communist chinese plane and there was not any question they were not using american technology to shoot down our neighbors this american pilot in the future when they shoot down american pilots that we will haunt us did we provide the technology necessary to kill those americans li 1100 i remember that very vividly i remember the tears and the sorrow of my nextdoor neighbor my playmates and the sense of hopelessness of the wife who was now left with the two children on her own to raise these kids and live her life without a loving husband i remember that very well i also remember that when a few years later my father he is passed away now perhaps one of the great things he did for our country was that he helped develop the navy way of dropping the atomic bomb to make this clear what happens is before if you drop a bomb from a plane like this a small plane cannot do it because it will blow up the plane but my father developed the system that the plane goes down a small jet aircraft can come down like this and loft the bomb ahead as the plane pulls around and heads in the opposite direction that was a most important development because after that was perfected americas aircraft carriers became strategic weapons and the formula in the cold war changed dramatically in favor of the united states because we now could deliver nuclear weapons throughout the world that did not just happen my father was taken out of a hospital bed when he described that to a general and given command of a squadron of hotshot pilots that they were going to develop that as soon as they could perfect that system with all speed because it meant so much to the security of our country he put his team together during that time period they worked and they pushed the limits and they pushed beyond the limits in order to perfect that system so that other american pilots would be safe when they delivered their weapons my mother told me something recently when my dad passed away about 11 months ago at the funeral my mother told me how during that time period my father was operating in total secrecy as was his whole operation and four young pilots lost their lives in developing this system four young pilots who were pushing the envelope beyond what they could flew too low flew too fast lost their lives one of these young pilots who died my mother remembers going to his home and his wife was there and it was their first wedding anniversary and they stood there my mother and my father telling this young wife the candlesticks on the table that her husband would never come home and they were never able to tell that wife why her husband had died the mission was top secret they could not let her know that her husband died developing a system that was so important to the national security of our country because it was that secret i do not know who that man was i do not know the names of the people who died during the cold war like that but there were many of them my nextdoor neighbor in japan these four young men they died protecting our country from communism and especially from the communist chinese we do not know their names and we owe them a great deal it is up to us to keep faith with those people we cannot let our country be in jeopardy after they paid so much of a price so dear a price for our security and to let some fantasy like a strategic partnership with the communist chinese put our country in jeopardy when so many people have sacrificed for our safety is a sin against our people"], [0.9999442100524902, 0.9999442100524902, 0, "i rise this evening to thank our colleagues for action taken in this body last thursday when we made an historic vote and for the first time in the history of this congress voted money in the emergency supplemental legislation for our nations first responders our nations fire and emergency management personnel i rise tonight to pay tribute to and to discuss that legislation but also to clarify one part of that legislation which i had to remove because of confusion and misrepresentation stated on the house floor in what was a very limited debate first of all the legislation itself is appropriate for an emergency supplemental bill because it in fact is aimed at our domestic emergency responders also in that legislation was 4 billion for our military which was desperately needed and which i heartily supported to help them overcome the shortfall in funding because of the level of deployments that the president has gotten our military involved in but for the first time in this legislation the congress voted by a margin of 386 to 28 a very lopsided margin to support my amendment which would provide 100 million to the nations fire and emergency services now let me discuss why this is so important over the last 10 years we have seen unprecedented increases in the number of disasters in this country hurricanes floods tornadoes earthquakes wild lands fires the world trade center bombing the oklahoma city bombing the atlanta olympic bombing numerous hazmat incidents highrise buildings and other incidents involving potential and real situations where lives have been lost and people have been injured now admittedly responding to local disasters is a local responsibility and as a conservative republican on fiscal issues i do not want to change that as a former mayor having been before that a local volunteer fire chief and a director of fire training for some 80 fire companies as a volunteer and then going back and working in my own community and then going on to serve on my county council county commission i understand that life safety is a local responsibility and my amendment did not intend to change that this was not an attempt as some would say to federalize the fire service it was not an attempt to have the federal government move in to take over jurisdiction or responsibility for what should be a state and local issue but we have to understand some hard facts first of all the fire service of this country which consists of 32 000 fire departments 85 percent of whom are volunteer in every state in the union and including 1 2 million men and women have responded to disasters in america longer than the country has been a country two hundred fifty years ago this organization of dedicated men and women sprang up to basically protect our towns and cities and all across america for the past 250 years these men and women have protected us from every type of disaster known to mankind from those that are natural to those that are manmade and they have done it very well in fact it is the only profession that i can think of where the bulk of those involved are volunteers and that loses on average 100 of its members every year that are killed in the line of duty now we have police officers that are killed we have military personnel that are killed but they are paid that does not make any difference it is still a tragic loss when that occurs but with the fire service each year on average 100 of them are killed and the bulk of those who are killed are volunteers they are doing what they do because they want to protect their communities yet at the federal level we have done little to assist these people because it has been thought of in america as a local jurisdictional responsibility but some things have been changing first of all the size of the disasters in recent times have been unprecedented the floods of the mississippi river in the midwest the loma prieta and northridge earthquake hurricanes floyd and andrew and hugo all of these incidents involved a massive impact on ordinary people the first responders to every one of these incidents was not the military it was not the fema bureaucrat it was not the civil defense person in the county courthouse the first responder in every incident that we have faced as a nation has been the local fire and ems person be he or she paid or volunteer and these disasters have had a terrible impact on the ability of these first responders to replace equipment that was ruined to buy new equipment that is needed or to deal with the kinds of tragedies that these natural and manmade disasters have caused but there is something else that is happening in the 1990s we began to see a new threat emerging a threat involving weapons of mass destruction chemical biological or perhaps even small nuclear devices and all of a sudden the buzzword around the beltway is that we should provide more support for our military for our civil defense community to respond to terrorism that would include a weapon of mass destruction but again the first responder to a terrorist act will not be a military unit it will not be a national guard unit it will not be a fema bureaucrat the first responder in any city in any town in any county across america to a terrorist incident will be a locallybased fire and or emergency responder so now we at the federal level are asking our country to prepare and yet we have not given any supportive substance to these men and women who we are asking to respond to a different type of threat to our stability and that is the threat from the use of a weapon of mass destruction for these reasons it is totally appropriate that we at the federal level provide some help to our emergency response community now those who would say that the federal governments support of 100 million for the fire service is simply an attempt to federalize them could not be further from the truth first of all the volunteer fire service in this country which makes up 85 percent of those 32 000 departments and 85 percent of those 1 2 million men and women has no interest in being federalized they have no interest in being taken over by the state or their county it is a proud tradition having been born and raised in a fire service family and having risen to the position of president of my fire company and then chief of a volunteer fire department and training director of an academy for 80 of those companies i understand the fire service mentality these are proud americans they want to protect their communities and they do not want government to become involved however they are facing some very unique challenges that require us to provide some assistance first of all the volunteers are having an extremely difficult time recruiting new volunteers they are spending so much of their time raising money through tag days and chicken dinners and bingos in the fire hall that they are taking away from their ability to train and to take care of the apparatus and prepare for the kinds of situations they have to respond to so fundraising is becoming a larger and larger part of the requirement of the volunteer firefighter to meet the needs of the fire department we need to provide some assistance in that effort recruitment is a big problem all over america i have traveled to all 50 states i have spoken to every state fire and ems group in the country and in every state i have heard the same message we are having a tough time recruiting young people money from the federal government can provide the assistance necessary to recruit young volunteers let me just give my colleagues a piece of frustration that i have heard around the country this president and this administration largely supported by the liberal wing of this body and the other body a few years ago created a wellintentioned program called americorps we were told by president clinton that amercorps was going to be great because it was going to give people a sense of commitment back to their community he told us it was going to create volunteers in our towns and our cities well here we are several years after americorps has been funded and guess what we are spending almost a half a billion dollars a year on americorps and yet not one of those 32 000 fire departments can qualify for americorps funding even worse than that when the presidential summit on volunteerism was held in philadelphia a few years ago the national volunteer fire council which represents all the volunteer fire organizations in america was not even invited to attend i had to threaten the administration threaten to hold a counter demonstration in philadelphia if they at least did not invite the national volunteer fire council which they eventually did but the point is here we are at the federal level spending a half a billion dollars a year on supposedly creating volunteers which by the way are paid a salary and are given health care benefits and in some cases are given college tuition and yet we have done nothing for the volunteer fire service which for the past 250 years has protected this country and which in every one of those 32 000 departments has volunteered completely without any active support from any level of government it is time we helped these people it is time we understand that we in washington do not have to find ways to create volunteers and pay them the volunteers are already there and i would also offer this i cannot think of one americorps volunteer who risked losing his or her life in the course of his or her duties again 100 of the nations fire and ems personnel every year are killed in their line of duty and yet we at the federal level have done nothing for them those who would say that we are trying to pay volunteers could not be further from the truth i will outline what this money is going to be used for it is going to be used to help recruit new volunteers to help better train to deal with incidents involving terrorist activity it is going to be used to help create loan programs and matching programs to buy new equipment to buy turnout gear to buy breathing apparatus to make sure that our volunteers and our paid firefighters nationwide are properly protected and able to respond to incidents that they will be facing throughout this year and in ensuing years that is what my amendment was all about and for those who think that we are trying to undermine volunteers let me just say this the worst way to undermine volunteers is to do nothing let the volunteers continue to be frustrated let them continue to spend all their time raising money until there are no more volunteers then what will we have to do mr speaker we will have to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money to replace the volunteers billions of dollars in fact one estimate done by a research agency came up with a figure of 36 billion a year that is what it would cost to replace the volunteer fire service of this nation it is in our interest to provide a small sum of money to help these people to continue to protect their towns to help them continue to do the kinds of things they have been doing for 250 years now we have a similar problem with the paid fire service the paid firefighters who largely protect our inner city areas and our more urban areas in the suburban districts around our cities are finding it extremely difficult to protect the constituents of their geographical areas because of the kinds of new threats that we see emerging the world trade center bombing where we had 100 000 people at risk was totally dealt with by the very professional new york city fire department yet they did not have the communications equipment they needed and in fact the fire commissioner at that time a friend of mine who is currently the police commissioner in new york told me that the single biggest need they had was an integrated communications capability to be able to communicate among themselves as well as with state and federal agencies chief mars the chief of the oklahoma city fire department another paid department a very capable department came in and testified before my committee 1 year after the murrah building bombing in oklahoma city and he told me the story of the communications system in oklahoma city which is typical of communication systems across america he said when he arrived on the scene his radio system very quickly became overtaxed and he could not communicate with the police or with the fbi or atf or the other agencies because they were all on different frequencies some were on highband frequencies some were on lowband frequencies but they could not communicate with each other because of the impending threat to hundreds of people that were trapped in the building or who were unaccounted for time was of the essence and the chief had to respond quickly so he switched to portable cellular phones and there on the scene law enforcement agencies and federal agencies were communicating with the fire chief through cellar telephones until the cell became overtaxed and the system failed so then the chief of oklahoma city fire department a very capable paid department in this country had to resort to handwriting messages and have firefighters and ems personnel carry those messages to other line officers what a terrible waste of time and what a terrible waste of resources to have an inner city chief have to write down messages when peoples lives are at risk that is not the exception that is unfortunately more common all over this country as we lack as a nation an integrated coordinated communications network we need to understand that our domestic defenders deserve as much attention as our international defenders now as a senior member of the committee on armed services i support the military i support the 4 billion addon in the supplemental we spend almost 300 billion a year on our nations international defenders and we value every life that is put on the line when they go into harms way to protect america it is about time we put the same value on the lives of those people who defend our cities every day of the year now these fire and ems personnel respond to every disasterthat we can think of from toxic materials in our chemical plants and our oil refineries to hazmat explosions on our highways to the kinds of natural disasters that i discussed early on in my comments this evening and they are faced with more and more technical challenges as they try to deal with these difficulties in saving peoples lives for all of these reasons it is important that this body made the statement that it made last thursday in fact the paid and volunteer fire an ems community of this country are the true american heroes if we want to take one group of people that perhaps better than any other group exemplified what america is all about it is the men and women of the emergency fire and ems services across this country now they do not wave their flags and stand up and come lobby the hill they do not have highpowered lobbyists to put big money into the pockets of people running for office but they are out there every day of the year 24 hours a day protecting our towns and our cities and they have done that well before the country was an actual nation over 250 years in fact our volunteers are oftentimes the backbone of their community it is the hall where we go to vote on election day it is the group that organizes the july 4 parades memorial day celebrations the christmas parties for the kids in the community it is the group that we all call when the cat is in the tree when the cellar has been flooded and when we need a search party to find a lost child and if we allow this group of people to have their needs unmet america is going to be torn apart because it will tear apart the fabric of our local towns and cities there is no group of people that we can find in 32 000 departments across this country in democrat and republican strongholds that are there day in and day out to protect their communities for all of these reasons i offered the amendment that i did last thursday an amendment that said that we should step in and provide emergency help for these emergency responders and this house voted overwhelmingly democrats and republicans joined together handinhand and said we agree three hundred eightysix members voted yes twentyeight voted no this strong show of support is the strongest indication we have ever had in washington that it is time we help these brave men and women now some would say wait a minute 100 million is a lot of money let me make some comparisons i have listened to this president stand up in this podium eight times now i have heard him talk about the importance of our nations teachers as a teacher by profession i agree with him i have heard him look us in the eye and talk about how we need to put funding for another 100 000 teachers to help our kids i understand his message i have heard this president stand up in that podium and talk about the need to help police officers around the country to put 100 000 cops on the street in our budget each year we provide over 3 billion for local law enforcement efforts nationwide again that is over 3 billion a year we even match the local towns to buy the costs of the police vests the bulletproof vests that protect police officers if in fact they are shot i support those efforts but is a police officer more important is a teacher more important than a paid or volunteer firefighter a paid or voluntary ems person especially when the bulk of them are volunteers in the 8 years i have heard that president speak from that well i have not heard one word from that podium about the nations firstresponders not one word about the fire and ems personnel who are the first thing in our inner cities on drug deals that have gone sour who are the first responders when a person has a heart attack or a stroke or when an accident occurs and there has got to be a rescue or when people are fleeing a refinery and they are running in to protect the property and the lives of the people around that facility not one word well this congress spoke up last thursday and it spoke up in a bipartisan way and it said it is about time america recognizes these unsung heroes who have asked for so little what will that 100 million do mr speaker well first of all 10 million will fund for the first time the rural volunteer fire protection program now this administration which talks about being supportive of fire service especially when they had their budget director go before the iaff union meeting here in washington this administration cut the funding for the rural volunteer fire program from 3 5 million to 2 5 million in 1 year that is not a commitment to helping the fire service my amendment fully funds the rural fire protection act to provide matching dollars for those small rural departments across america in our farmlands in our rural areas where they really need to buy that antique or used truck where they need to buy that extra set of turnout gear it provides matching funds so the money they raise from chicken dinners and tag days can be matched now with 10 million of funding from the federal government the second 10 million goes through fema to provide burn research nothing is more important to a firefighter and let me say this that there is no injury more traumatic than a burn having been a fire chief having responded to numerous situations where both innocent people and fire and ems personnel have been burned i can tell my colleagues there is nothing more traumatic than that type of injury we need to do more in the area of research for burn treatment burn prevention and the cosmetic surgery necessary after a burn to allow a person to live a normal life the 10 million in our amendment last week is used to match money from local nonprofit burn foundations all across america not just to benefit firefighters but to benefit those children who might dump over a scolding pot of coffee or hot water and cause themselves to be burned that burn research money is absolutely essential and even 10 million is not really enough the biggest part of the 100 million 80 million dollars goes to create a program administered by fema of competitive grants that any one of the 32 000 fire and ems departments in america can compete for they have to match it dollar for dollar some of our states have lowinterest loan programs they can use this money some of our towns put some local tax money in they can use those dollars or again those fire departments can use the money they raise from their bingos from their tag days from their chicken dinners from all the other fundraisers they hold that 80 million by being doubled and matched dollar for dollar will create 160 million of additional spending to help the men and women of the fire service of this nation the money can be used to help create programs that will help them recruit new volunteers that will help our paid departments reduce casualties and reduce injuries nothing could be more important than this commitment of funding for our real american heroes that is what the amendment did and that is why it received such broad bipartisan support but in the brief amount of time we had to discuss the amendment which was 10 minutes even though i had broad bipartisan support on both sides of the aisle for the initial amendment there were 5 minutes called for by an opponent who rose at the eleventh hour at the last minute while the amendment was on the floor objecting to one provision in my legislation and i want to discuss that tonight because i could not clarify it in the minute that i had to respond to what was 3 minutes of accusations there was an objection raised to one part of my amendment that would have changed the language dealing with how local communities can spend federal community development block grant monies as my colleagues know federal community development block grant funds which i strongly support are designed to help low and mod erateincome americans in fact we spend 4 8 billion a year on the cdbg program now the town that i used to be the mayor of which before that i was the fire chief of is one of the most distressed towns in pennsylvania we were a prime target of cdbg funds before i became the mayor and while i was the mayor i understand the role of cdbg dollars in poor areas after serving as mayor i served as a county commissioner over a county of almost 600 000 people in suburban philadelphia county again with a large concentration of impoverished people along our water front i was again a strong supporter of the cdbg program but i saw some problems and some opportunity with that program that i want to discuss and which were a part of my amendment current regulations specifically define what kinds of activities cdbg funds can be used for the ultimate decision is not done by the federal government but rather the funds are passed to the states and passed to our towns on a formula basis and our counties and they must prove that 70 percent of those funds are being used to benefit low and moderate income personnel i support that ratio i am not opposed to that but let me talk about some inequities in the program there is nothing more important to a poor person than having their life saved than being rescued from a burning building than being pulled from a traffic accident or a hazmat incident in fact across america the largest concentration of heavy industry as it was in my hometown where half of my town was made up 6f oil refineries the largest concentration of hazards are in poor areas but yet even though the cdbg dollars are designed to be modified and doled out at the local level by local officials there has been a prohibition against local county commissioners and mayors and city councils from using the cdbg dollars for fire and life safety unless it is totally confined to the impoverished area of that jurisdiction my amendment sought to clarify that my amendment simply said that there are examples where a jurisdiction has low and moderate income people who have needs of fire and life safety that we need to broaden and specifically define the uses of cdbg dollars for some examples if we wanted to establish in my home county of delaware county which is typical of many counties across america has a small concentration of low and moderate income people along the waterfront if we wanted to use cdbg dollars for a countywide training facility that would respond to those incidents in the impoverished communities where the heavy industry is we could not do it because under current regulations by hud those cdbg dollars could not be used for a training facility unless it was totally in the area of the poverty and only used by those fire departments within the area of jurisdiction of the impoverished community not broader than that area alone so it is not cost effective so it does not get done and the cdbg money that could be doing a lot more to help the poor cannot do it in fact we should be able to assist those fire and ems departments that regularly respond to impoverished communities now in my home county if there is a major fire in an oil refinery which is in a poor area all the fire departments around our area come in with them those fire departments are all volunteer they are coming from communities that might not be low and moderate income but they are protecting the lives of poor people yet the current cdbg regulations specifically prohibit the use of those dollars to benefit the lifesaving activities of fire and ems departments that are called into impoverished areas that does not make any sense at all there is an accident on a major highway going through a city and a volunteer fire department from a neighboring community responds and rescues the people there is a prohibition against using those cdbg dollars to help that fire or ems department out that was what my amendment was about it was not as some of my colleagues said an attempt to undermine the cdbg program that was hogwash in fact it was an outandout lie some of my colleagues knew it was a lie there was no attempt to undermine the cdbg program i take my commitment to poverty very seriously i was born the youngest of nine children in a poor town i have supported every effort by this congress to help empower poor people i was the coauthor of legislation 3 years ago that this administration objected to to increase our community services block grant program by 100 million and we did it we led the effort on the republican side of the aisle not the democrat side of the aisle for that 100 million increase so when members stood up with 1minute soundbites and said this amendment was out to gut the cdbg program or undermine cdbg it offended me in fact it outraged me that was not the intent and that was not the substance of the legislation the people who made those statements owe the fire service of this nation an apology i hope every firefighter and ems person in this country who heard the kind of comments made last week will let their feelings be known to their member of congress to our colleagues that that was uncalled for our effort was to provide flexibility for local town councils and for local mayors to clarify the use of cdbg dollars for fire and ems purposes and to allow cdbg funds to be used for programs that ultimately benefit low and moderate income people as well as those areas around there where the emergency response groups go in from time to time or assist in the effort of providing life safety measures for our low and moderate income americans that was what my amendment was about and anyone who attempts to try to characterize that amendment in a different manner was just being untruthful it was unfortunate that my colleagues largely on the minority side got cold feet and instead of doing what our majority whip wanted the gentleman from texas for whom i have the highest respect and that was to leave that provision in the amendment i felt it would have jeopardized the overall amendment itself and therefore i asked unanimous consent to modify the amendment and remove that provision i wish i had not had to do that because then instead of 100 million for the fire and ems community we could have had access to several hundred millions of dollars perhaps even up to 1 billion of available dollars going to our local towns to give our local county council members and our mayors and city council members the authority to use some of that money to help provide more protection not less for low and moderate income americans in my own county those funds could have been used for enhancing our countywide fire training to benefit our low and moderate income people it could have been used to set up a countywide hazmat team that could have responded to those incidents in those low and moderate income areas it could have been used to provide an emergency response antiterrorism unit to respond again to low and moderate income areas but it was shot down or it was forced on me to withdraw that amendment because of misstatements that were made on this house floor in a brief 5minute period of time my colleagues especially on the other side did not want to have a vote that they could not properly explain to their folks back home and did not want to be perceived to perhaps be antipoverty antipoor when that was not the issue at all but i say this there will be another day i am not going to let this cdbg issue die because i want to give my colleagues some examples that my colleagues on the other side and a couple of my colleagues on my side should have been talking about you want some undermining of the cdbg program let me just give my colleagues two examples as someone who served as the mayor of a poor town for 5 years and a county commissioner and chairman of the county commission for 5 years overseeing cdbg dollars my colleagues on the floor said we dont want to use this money for fire and life safety and for emergency response but you did not hear them mention that it is allowable under the law to use that same money for historic preservation in the richest towns in america you cannot use the money to provide life safety but you can use it to restore old buildings in the richest towns in our counties there is a second allowance of that cdbg money under current federal guidelines under huds stupid rules you can use that money to cut curbs and sidewalks i am not against cutting curbs and sidewalks i want to see people who are challenged and are confined to wheelchairs be able to get up and down on curbs and sidewalks throughout my town and throughout my county and throughout my state but as a former county commissioner i can tell you that that was one of the only eligible programs besides historic preservation that could be used in any town in our county even the richest one so what did we do we did like every other county does we cut every curb and sidewalk in every town we could and so hundreds of thousands of curbs were cut in towns all across america in many cases where no handicapped person would ever travel i remember the former mayor of philadelphia the current chairman of the democratic national committee ed rendel a good mayor once stating his frustration with federal funds that they had cut every curb on the major expressways going to the city yet it would be impossible and unsafe for any handicapped person to cross that street but he did it because it was one of the only ways to spend cdbg dollars to help in curb improvements so the irony of the amendment i offered last week was my colleagues were saying to me we do not want to support your effort to help rescue poor people to help rescue handicapped people trapped in highrise buildings we want to use the money to cut curbs on sidewalks where a handicapped person may never ride or may never go or we want to use it to restore historic buildings in our wealthiest towns my goal was to help use those dollars and help give that local flexibility for county commissioners and council members and mayors to help save those handicapped people to develop training mechanisms and response to enter those buildings to rescue those people from floods and tornadoes and earthquakes but unfortunately my colleagues again largely on the minority side said to me if you keep that in we cant support your amendment and so as a result i pulled that provision from my amendment and i had to offer the amendment in an amended form with only the 100 million of funding i hope our colleagues in reading both my statement last thursday and my comments here tonight understand what really happened with the provision for cdbg it was not an attempt to undermine the cdbg program it was not an attempt to get our foot in the door as one of my colleagues said there is no better way to help poor people than to provide life safety for poor people today hud has a system of measures that do not make sense that are ridiculous that are outrageous as i just cited in two instances are a gross waste of taxpayers money i think the program needed reform and i will continue this effort hopefully with my colleagues support again i want to thank our colleagues who voted for the amendment for those who did not i would ask them to reconsider i now want to focus the attention of our colleagues on the other body we need to create an awareness among our senate colleagues that this issue is extremely important i would ask my colleagues to lobby the leaders in the other body on the need to move this legislation to provide this 100 million of funding on the way home from washington last week i had the pleasure of a phone conversation with a distinguished senator from delaware bill roth who this year is chairman of the congressional fire and ems caucus which i formed 13 years ago senator roth has said that he will champion this issue in the senate and even though senator lott has said he will not bring up an emergency supplemental bill as an individual piece of legislation senator roth has said he will champion the amendment that i offered as a separate freestanding effort in the senate we need our colleagues to use every bit of energy to convince every member of the other body to support senator roths efforts in moving this 100 million piece of legislation through in a very quick and timely manner i would encourage our colleagues to enlist the support of their constituents all across america"], [0.9999357461929321, 0.9999357461929321, 0, "usually on tuesday i come as chairman of the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources to talk about the subject of illegal narcotics and our national drug policy tonight is thursday night most of the members are heading back to their districts but i have an opportunity to continue sort of as paul harvey says tell the rest of the story that i left off on on tuesday this past tuesday night and also to kind of update the congress my colleagues and the american people on some of the threats that we face as a nation from illegal narcotics tonight i have a little bit different focus but i am going to try to highlight some of the failures of this presidency and this administration i have done that before i do not mean to be critical other than deal with the facts of the situation and deal with the legacy of this administration as it relates to illegal narcotics and the problem with our society in just a few minutes americans across the country will turn on their nightly news and see i am sure clips of todays talk by the president before the naacp in baltimore tonight the american people will hear his speech i have got a copy of his speech what is incredible about his speech is what is left out once again the president who has only talked about a war on drugs and i think i have the exact figures eight times mentioned the war on drugs in 7 years according to the nexus research that we conducted on the number of times the president had talked about awar on drugs but if one takes the presidents speech from today before the naacp he does not talk about the war on drugs the president paints a rosy picture and again a copy of the speech that was given to me says today we are releasing an annual report on the status of our children according to the study the teen birth rate for 15 to 17yearolds has dropped to the lowest the birth rate for africanamerican adolescents has also dropped the president talks about everything but one of the most impacting problems that has faced our minority community what the president is not going to tell the naacp or recite to the american people are the statistics that have been given to our subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources the president will not tell us that according to the national household survey on drug abuse drug use increased some 41 percent from the beginning of his administration in 1993 to 1998 among young african americans an astounding increase according to that household survey on drugs also another minority population that has been dramatically impacted is the hispanic minority population with young hispanics experiencing an increase from 1993 to 1998 of 38 percent these are facts that should startle every minority parent in this country and were left out of the presidents address today in baltimore it is incredible that the naacp would meet in baltimore and that the president would speak to them in baltimore because i always use baltimore as the prime example of a failed policy relating to illegal narcotics that failed policy is the direct result of the mayor that was elected there i took from a 1996 book by dan baum smoke and mirrors that he is very critical on the war on drugs and he is very laudatory towards those that promote legalization in 1998 kurt schmoke was the candidate and was elected despite his liberalization policy this is from that book written in 1996 it says kurt schmoke however dodged the bullet in other words he got elected written off politically in 1988 for suggesting the legalization of drugs mayor schmoke approached his first election campaign in 1991 with trepidation but every time one of his opponents either in the primary or general election tried to blast him as the legalizer the shot went wild and it never became an issue having won office in 1987 with 51 percent of the vote and he calls him this legalizer schmoke won reelection with 58 percent this is touting electing a mayor who has a liberalization policy a nonenforcement policy of illegal narcotics the president met in baltimore today and spoke before the naacp these are not my words a republican majority member of the congress this is a report from time magazine and i will read it verbatim from september 6 1999 the legacy of the mayor that adopted this policy favorable towards narcotics let me read marylands largest city seems to have more razor wire and abandoned buildings than kosovo meanwhile the prevalence of open air drug dealing has made no loitering signs as common as stop signs baltimore which has a population of 630 000 has sunk under the depressing triple crown of urban degradation middleincome residents are fleeing at a rate of 1 000 a month the murder rate has been more than three times as high as new york citys and 1 in 10 citizens is a drug addict government officials dispute the last claim i am reading from this article in time it is more like one in eight says veteran city councilwoman rikki spector and we have probably lost count this is the legacy of a failed policy the president did not talk about that in baltimore today what is sad is that nearly twothirds of the population of baltimore is minority and african american the victims of what has taken place let me also read a little bit about what this article says i do not want to again give my opinion at this point but let me state what was in the time magazine how did baltimore get here smokestack economy that was the lifeblood of the city for decades has died and drained its money and its soul in 1940 half of baltimores population lived and more importantly worked in baltimore today only 15 percent live there my colleagues just heard the statistics of the flight meanwhile increasing incompetent political factions have elbowed each other for state handouts the reign of current mayor kurt schmoke an ivy league educated african american was supposed to restore the power of the mayors job and the health of the city and schmoke has spent his 12 years ineffectively lording over an increasing mess this is where the president and the naacp met today this is what the policy again a liberalized policy of legalization nonenforcement has led to repeatedly deaths over 300 when one stops and thinks of this this is baltimore a population and we see the population went from nearly a million to 675 000 what is absolutely incredible is the number of addicts and this is 1996 the addicts were 39 000 a part again of this policy they have gone from 39 000 if we take the figures one in every eight according to the city councilperson we are looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 000 heroin and drug addicts in baltimore the president of the united states when he spoke in baltimore did not tell us about the legacy of this community what is interesting is the policy of mayor schmoke is the policy that the clinton administration has attempted to adopt on a national scale that is why we see a prevalence of illegal narcotics coming into the country non or lack of enforcement do not stop the drugs at their source do not go after the dealers my colleagues think that possibly i am making some partisan statement this is the record of the clinton administration on individual defendants prosecuted in federal courts drug prosecutions 1992 to 1996 they went from 29 000 to 26 000 instead of tougher enforcement the president and the attorney general and the department of justice under their leadership went to fewer prosecutions so we have hounded the administration since 1996 to increase prosecutions and they are starting to edge up now my colleagues possibly could not believe this but they have managed to also divert the intent of congress and they have managed to bring sentencing down so first they tried this nonprosecution now they are trying to blame us by not being tough on sentencing so first they were making a joke out of prosecution for these offenses now the sentences are down convictions also are a concern the convictions we also see the same trend down now my colleagues might say well the tough zero tolerance policy does not work there could be nothing further than the truth the president cited figures today in baltimore before the naacp but he did not tell us that those figures are impacted by jurisdictions with tough prosecutions the murder rate in new york city was averaging 2 000 murders in new york a year when rudy guliani took office and instituted a zero tolerance policy in that city he got tough on narcotics arrests this chart so dramatically shows that as one increased the arrests for narcotics one decreased the crimes the murder rate dropped 58 percent in new york city again this is baltimore baltimore the deaths continue over 300 in new york city we had in the mid600 range number of murders in the last 2 years down from 2 000 a 58 percent decrease this is the liberal policy again that the president did not talk about but the policy of tolerance a policy of not going after criminals who are dealing in death and destruction we see what they have done not by my words but by the words of the media to a great and historic city this is interesting also we conducted a hearing in baltimore about a month ago after mayor schmoke thank god left office and a new mayor mayor omalley was elected we went into the community and the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources conducted a hearing there i believe it was on a monday the mayor came and testified and i thanked him for that he heard the police chief testify that he was going to make a lame effort at going after openair drug markets there was also testimony at that hearing that the police chief and others in the administration had made a decision not to participate with the high intensity drug traffic effort in cooperation with the feds and other agencies thank goodness when the mayor heard this he dismissed that police chief and he has appointed a new chief who has adopted a zero tolerance in that city that is the bright spot but again the president did not talk today about the death and destruction these deaths and this destruction the 312 in 1997 312 in 1998 and 308 in 1999 they all have faces on them these are wonderful human beings that god created and this only shows the tragedy of death imagine what it is like to have a population of a city like baltimore with one in eight according to the city council person not me or even one in 10 if we want to use that statistic are drug addicted a young person drug addicted a father or a mother a wage earner imagine the toll imagine transposing this policy on the united states of america fortunately it is limited to a jurisdiction like baltimore others jurisdictions like rudy giuliani in new york and others who have adopted a zero tolerance policy arein fact making great progress and the progress that the president spoke about today is due to some of those efforts in fact it is so dramatic these statistics for new york and some of the other zero tolerance and tough enforcement policies are so dramatic the effect of them that they are affecting our national statistics the baltimore police department estimates that 95 percent of the street gangs in baltimore aredealing in drug trafficking specifically heroin and cocaine former mayor schmokes nonenforcement policy led to in 1996 baltimores leading the nation in drugrelated emergency emissions which grew to 785 per 100 000 population of 20 cities analyzed by nida which is our national institute of drug administration the city of baltimore ranked second in heroin emergency admissions and baltimore accounted for 63 percent of all of marylands drug overdoses this is again the legacy that the president of the united states did notwant to talk about but the naacp heard other statistics today even touting the progress that we have made and much of it under again zero tolerance efforts around the country evenwith decreasing crime since 1960 total crimes have increased by more than 300 percent since 1960 violent crimes have increased by more than 550 percent ninetynine percent of americans will be the victims of a theft at least once in their lives what is interesting when we talk to the law enforcement people whether they are in baltimore orlando or in new york they tell us that 70 or 80 percent of the crimes committed are drug related people who are stealing and maiming and killing because they are on illegal narcotics or trying to gain resources to obtain illegal drugs the violent crime rate in the united states is worse than any other industrialized country and we can again trace it back to drugabuse never in the presidents speech today did he talk about the effect of illegal narcotics before the naacp and the minority population of our country which unfortunately is the most victimized victimized in death victimized in social destruction victimized in every way imaginable in the criminal justice system unfairly victimized and we will hear people say well we just need to treat folks and we need to spend more money on treatment and i will talk about that in just a few min utes but treating only the wounded inbattle is never the answerif you are in battle and really waging an aggressive fightteenagers are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crimes as all adults combined and fewer than 10 percent of all criminals commit about twothirds of the crime again i show the statistics of this administration and their record for prosecution as it dropped and then we got them to go after prosecution from 1996 on when we took the majority and put pressure on them now they are dropping sentencing the amount of time that these hardened criminals are facing behind bars i submit my colleagues that the wrong americans are behind bars it is the parents and the citizens of baltimore it is the wonderful citizens of washington d c our nations capital is another example of a horrible situation ignored for 40 years under the control of the other party where i would come to washington week after week and every week read of death and destruction and almost all of it drug related fortunately this republican administration in the congress brought some balance to the district of columbia we literally had to seize the district and put a control board in charge of the district but when we inherited the district of columbia stop andthink of what this majority inherited it is just like what they did to the country as a whole this district of columbia was running threequarters of a billion dollars a year in deficit and we have just about balanced that of course we did haveto put in a board of control and unfortunately had to deny some temporary constraints on home rule but we inherited a horrible situation again the president of the united states did not talk about what 40 years of democrat administration did to the people of baltimore or washifigton d c our nations capital i always save some of these articles about again what took place and i do not want to divert too much from the narcotics issue but i cannot resist mentioning for the benefit of my colleagues the policy that really almost destroyed our nations capital and national treasure here are a few of these articles the trauma care center when we took over the congress in d c in grave danger it wasbasically nonfunctional the housing authority was bankrupt when the republican majority took over the job training pro gram in 1 year spent 20 million anddid not train one person in our nations capital this is what the new majority inherited i will never forget the articles in the paper about the morgue and the air conditioning having broken down and bodies were stacked up because the district under the democrat control had allowed the district to operate in an unmanageable fashion what happened was they could not even pay to have the indigents buried in the city and they were stacked like cord wood in the morgue and the morgue had no airconditioning the citys water system was failing we had to give it over basically 40 years of administration and misadministration led to this and the stories go on and on they are unbelievable and i know people unless i brought the actual articles people would think i would be making them up the foster care system wears out employees this is a lady who said as she was quitting because this is worse than guam she worked in guam what they did in the district of columbia again primarily a majority of african americans but the president did not talk about this in his chat before the naacp what they did but he did take credit for i think some of the changes that we have made and how sad for the neediest of the needy even in public housing an article from the washington post let me read it it says the department of public and assisted housing which has had 10 directors in the last decade suggested that it was rife with corruption mismanagement and waste and this is again what we inherited but what the president did not talk about in baltimore today and affecting who the minority population and the weakest link in the minority population those without housing thosesubjected to social services and the list again goes on and on i think in the last 4 years as good stewards the new majority has turned some of that around but the presidentwould not talk about that just took credit for statistics and used them to his advantage unfortunately the legacy of this administrationgoes beyond baltimore it goes beyond washington our nations capital again i have said this before it is not rocket science we know where these drugs are coming from we have done everything i have done everything i can do since i came to congress since i was involved in the effort back in the reagan administration back in the early 1980s wheni helped to develop the drug certification law and worked on some of the andean strategies and other things to stop drugs cost effectively at the source but we have watched thisadministration dismantle those costeffective programs again we know exactly where the illegal drugs are coming from right now we know that 70 to 80 percent ofthe cocaine and heroin is coming out of colombia now how in heavens namecould we get that percentage ofcocaine coming out of colombia and i want to say it was not easy this is not a guessing game either the dea has what is called the dea signature program the dea provided our subcommittee with these pie charts this is the most recent 1998 this shows us exactly where heroin is coming from this shows us that heroin is coming 65 percent of it from south america 17 percent from mexico actually up some 20 percent in 1 year from mexico they know this because when they seize the heroin it is tested and it is almost a dna process where they can tell almost from what fields it came from this is all colombian the red here is all colombian in 19921993 there was almost zero heroin coming from colombia but this administration through an incredible series of direct policies and failures has managed to make colombia the center of 70 to 80 percent of cocaine coming into the united states and another 65 to 70 percent depending on which year and we do not have 1999 of heroin coming into the united states we know that there was almost no cocaine coca produced in colombia in 1992 at the beginning of this administration but they have managed to make it a producer now how could they make it a producer this chart shows and again these are statistics provided even by the administration but they show federal drug spending on the international that would be stopping drugs at their source this shows in the end of the bush administration and then we had a democratcontrolled white house and senate that they immediately gutted the international programs that meant that the source country programs were cut dramatically we see here the international programs since the republicans took control in 1996 and it takes about an extra year because the budget we do is in advance but we can see that we are getting back to the 19911992 levels right now in 19992000 but they gutted the programs when the republicans took control that is as far as source is concerned and then the next thing that is cost effective in getting drugs once they get to the streets it is a que pasa activity for our law enforcement it is very tough but it is tough and it is costly and you have to have incredible expenditures for police force so the second most cost effective thing is to stop drugs as they are coming from where they are being produced cocaine and heroin for example and here we look at interdiction interdiction and there is no real extra cost for the military there may be some extra flight hours and things of that sort but you already have the hardware you have the planes you have the military engaged and you have the military conducting exercises the military does not do any enforcement they just provide surveillance information and then the information is given to the country where the drugs are produced this administration did not think that was a good idea so they stopped information sharing they stopped information sharing they stopped resources getting to colombia those actions have very direct results i remember in hearings in 1993 1994 and before the house of representatives saying to not stop the information sharing to the countries in fact many of the countries involved would shoot down the drug traffickers and go after them but again this administration said we cant do that heaven forbid we should go after a drug trafficker or provide any information in fact they even got an attorney who had been in the department of justice and transferred i believe over to dod to give that opinion and the entire congress had to act to overturn that opinion that we could not share information they are at the same game again unitedstates officials cite trend in colombia lack of air support hindering drug war the same thing is happening again and this is in fact confirmed by the administrations ambassador from peru the administrations ambassador from peru chided the administration and i received the report it says drug control dod contributes to reducing the illegal drug supply their assets have declined i requested this report independently conducted by gao provided to me the end of last year the beginning of this year gao found that according to the unitedstates ambassador appointed by this administration warned in an october letter to the department of state that the reduction in air support could have a serious impact on the price of coca the president did not tell you today that he is directly responsible for the policy that cut interdiction that cut source countries and that cut off colombia from receiving assistance and turned colombia into a disaster into an international basket case this is exactly what happened having been involved when the new majority took over the house and the other body we began 4 years ago trying to put humpty dumpty back together again the strategy that worked so well in the 1980s and they will tell you the drug war is a failure and i will disprove that in just a moment but we went down mr hastert the former chair with responsibility of this subcommittee for drug policy went down with mr zeliff who was also involved and i was on the subcommittee as a junior member we talked to the officials in peru and bolivia we got their cooperation and we gave them a tiny bit of financial assistance from the congress look what happened to andean cocaine production down 60 percent in peru 55 percent in bolivia look what happened with the administrations policy towards colombia stop helicopters stop information sharing stop resources stop any assistance dramatic increase i told you about heroin this is cocaine there was no heroin produced at the beginning of this administration you can see almost no cocaine this is a policy of failure and destruction i can trace the cocaine on the streets of washington d c and new york back to colombia i can trace the heroin back to colombia and i can trace it back to this policy this policy and even when the congress even when we as a new majority funded assistance to increase again interdiction of drugs which is our national responsibility i mean we are not police men and women and we do not provide that service that is done mostly by local and state we do have some federal agencies but we cannot do that what we can do is stop the illegal narcotics before they come into our borders in fact this report provided to me also says the number of flight hours dedicated to detecting and monitoring illicit drug shipments declined from approximately 46 000 to 15 000 it declined 68 percent from 1992 to 1999 so even when we were ramping up attempting to ramp up to get funds to go after the drug dealers this report also shows that the administration diverted assets we had awacs that actually gave information on the growth in traffickers awacs planes the vice president when he spoke to the naacp did not tell you that he diverted those planes to kosovo i am sorry actually he was personally i understand responsible for diverting the planes to alaska to look at oil spills while the children of baltimore are dying by the dozens while the children in our nations capital were getting slaughtered and the diversion of assets went on and on money that we had asked to go down to colombia and south america tens of millions ended up in haiti in failed nationbuilding attempts which now have turned into an even bigger disaster with one corrupt government succeeding another and now haiti the latest reports we have is a major transit area for illegal narcotics most of the administrations efforts in nationbuilding went into building the legislative and judicial and enforcement structure and it has turned with the millions and millions of taxpayer dollars billions into the biggest transit zone the situation only gets worse this is something the president did not talk about today in his report he did not tell you that he diverted two awacs airborne control systems aircraft that were on the counternarcotics mission that were stopping the death and destruction 15 973 remember that our latest figures on deaths as a direct result of illegal narcotics drugs in this country in 1998 but he committed two of the awacs to reassign them in january of 1999 to support the iraq nofly zone then in april 1999 for the kosovo crisis if you wonder why our cities our communities our young people are being deluged with illegal narcotics you can just look at the administrations record this report also shows in addition to air flights down dramatically some 68 percent that also maritime efforts unitedstates maritime efforts to go after suspected maritime illegal drug shipments declined 62 percent under this administration so if you wonder why our children are getting drugs cheaper more available addicted to them and dying in unprecedented numbers across the land it is no wonder again it is not just baltimore or it is not just the nations capital that is affected by this here is a report just a few days ago by abc news july 10 it says less than 2 percent of young people age 12 to 17 have ever tried heroin incidentally i think it is a 92 percent increase during this administration in use of heroin among that youth class another legacy of this administration this report says but the drug now is cheaper more accessible and more potent how did it get more available when you close down a war on drugs and you only concentrate on treating the wounded you can see where that incredible supply is coming into the country it says it is more accessible and more potent and is fast surpassing cocaine as the drug of choice in many communities it says portland and seattle heroin has reached unprecedented levels in some cities like portland oregon and seattle where the number of fatal overdoses has continued to climb year after year in the last decade this is a startling figure in 1999 portland experienced the highest number of heroinrelated deaths overdose deaths 114 i come from central florida we have exceeded our past year which was a disaster of heroininduced deaths the cocaine legacy strikes every family everyone in the whole country i know was grieving with dr j actually his son dr j is a resident of my district and we watched as the family looked for his son and his son unfortunately had been victimized by cocaine and in todays paper we have a report that test finds cocaine in the teens body we do not know if that is a direct result yet of his tragic death but we know the horror that that family experienced we know the grief that that family experienced we know the torment that that young man went through and how a national hero a legend and his family have been so affected and our heart goes out to them but unfortunately every family in america today is affected by illegal narcotics we see the statistics over and over this administration adopted a policy to keep helicopters to keep surveillance information to keep any kind of assistance going to colombia until just last year and suddenly they woke up and found and i think it is reported they also did a survey and found people were absolutely appalled at what was going on but last year the drug czar declared this an emergency this republican congress acted immediately the white house and the president did not submit a colombia aid package until the 7th of february 2000 he waited and waited and dillied and dallied on march 30 this house of representatives passed a supplemental and just a few days ago both the house and senate acted and passed a supplemental containing the aid to put the rest of this picture back together it will work we know it works it has worked it has other elements in it other than interdiction and source country a good package instead of talking about this today or taking that bill and signing it before the naacp and saying im going to stop the killing of your children the president as far as i know today has not signed the bill it is awaiting his signature and it is my hope that that will be signed if it has not been signed again to correct the situation it is unfortunate we have to spend over 1 billion now to deal with the disaster that has been created ej 1900 let me talk about the emphasis of this administration you hear it on the floor repeatedly during the colombia debate they just said we have to have treatment on demand we have many people who need treatment i support treatment i would vote for any amount of treatment for anyone addicted to narcotics but when you get to the point of addiction it is very difficult to save anyone this is not like cigarettes it is not like alcohol when you are addicted to some of these hard drugs you completely become victimized by it and we do not have any cure sixty or 70 percent of those who go into public treatment programs are failures and repeated failures over and over again you hear that we have been putting money in the war on drugs or the war on drugs is a failure fighting drugs and they should be legalized this is in fact the record we have more than doubled the amount from 1992 when this administration changed the policy closed down the source country stopping drugs at their source the interdiction we have more than doubled the amount going in i have records of treatment and research drug prevention all of the different categories demand reduction almost all of them doubled so while they were cutting the source programs and the interdiction and other programs they in fact and we were even the republicans since 1995 have increased treatment some 26 percent so it is a fallacy to say that we have not put money in treatment the problem we have and i chair the subcommittee is we do not know what will work we have programs the programs actually that are mostsuccessful are the nongovernment they run 50 60 percent success rates most of them are faithbased and we are trying to see if we can support them in some way given the restrictions that we have mixing public money with religious funds go it is a fallacy to say we are not putting money in treatment again i know this makes the other side of the aisle cringe and this is not a chart that the president brought to baltimore to show the naacp this is not the chart that those will tell you that thewar on drugs is a failure now this is a failure that you have a decline in drug use during the reagan and bush administration this is the chart that shows the longterm trend and lifetime prevalence of cocaine use we have it for drug use let us get this overall that is just cocaine this is overall they will tell you again this is a failure that it was declining here that is a failure if you have fewer young people using drugs that is a failure get that now it is a failure but this is a success the clinton administration policy i wish i had an overlay to show where they closed down the source country they closed down the interdiction they cut the coast guard they cut the military involvement they cut the drug czars staffing in this period this is the direct result an increase it is almost ironic that you see this little bleep here and that is where we took control and started our efforts there is some slight leveling off but that is unfortunately not totally successful because again one of the major conduits of illegal narcotics hard narcotics heroin high purity cocaine is colombia which has now become the major producer this is also the heroin record under the clinton and bush and reagan administrations the statistics during that administration are quite interesting based on national household survey data illicit drug use and that is the same survey that i cited with current statistics and it is nice to compare to use comparative studies the same studies over comparative times based on national household survey data elicit drug use declined 50 percent from 1985 to 1992 now that is a failure you see this is a failure because it declined you had a president who under president reagan he had a tough andean strategy a source zone strategy an interdiction strategy you had a president president bush the reason they went after noriega is because he was involved in drugs and illegal profits from drugs and he sent our troops in the opposite is the case with the retreat of the clinton administration and you see the direct results again if we could do an overlay we would show as they cut these programs out in 1992 you see again a trend an increase in drng use and this is for all this is lifetime annual and 30 day measurements again you see a leveling off where we began our efforts where we passed an extensive drug education and prevention program one of the most extensive in history we differed with the administration we thought that broadcasters should increase and donate their time the administration wanted to spend taxpayer money we felt it was so important that we did reach a compromise so we have a 1 billion program over 5 years matched by 1 billion in donations but again if you did an overlay you would see as this administration instituted its policy of failure you in fact see an increase in drug use among our youth one of the other things that is disturbing is the entire effort of the united states to curtail illegal narcotics we know that heroin and cocaine and even methamphetamine and even the heroin that is produced in mexico now is in increasing volume we had in panama up until may of last year the headquarters for our forward operating location unfortunately the administration bungled the negotiations of course we were sort of destined to lose panama and the 10 billion in facilities and we have lost two ports to some chinese interests through illegal tenders put all that aside but we still should have been able to negotiate the lease or use of these in antinarcotics efforts and the state department failed miserably now we are scurrying around at great cost and i think in the supplemental package it is over 120 million to put in new installations in ecuador in aruba and curacao those two agreements have finally been signed 10 year agreements but we are going to have to spend that money upgrading bases and airfields to do our surveillance operation in the meantime we have exposed ourselves to incredible volume you will see it in the streets the schools with our young people of these illegal drugs what is interesting and we predicted it and i have a recent article here that shows even europe is now becoming victimized by cocaine which is coming in they are producing so much there is an oversupply the price is so low in the united states and it is so available that this weeks paper one of these articles shows that now it is coming into europe in incredible volume so we have basically closed down our surveillance operation taxpayer money is going to have to be spent to put that back in place it will be 2002 according to the latest reports that we have what concerns me and republicans make mistakes just like democrats and i guess i cannot refer to the member of the other body who is proposing this but they are now trying to penalize and it is someone of my own party peru peru has president fujimoro and you heard his record of success cutting 63 percent of the cocaine production instead of rewarding him we are going to penalize him because again some of those are not happy with the election he is in his i believe third term but he has done a remarkable job and because his opponent wanted to call off the election imagine okay bush is ahead we are going to call off the election or gore is ahead we are going to call off the election this candidate could not even decide on a date certain when an election should be held but we have members of congress who now want to penalize peru who has done a great job and i am sad to hear that we should be assisting them and applauding them for cutting off the supply of deadly narcotics coming into the united states instead of cutting assistance to them as we wrap up tonight i tried to talk about some of the things that the president of the united states did not talk about before the naacp in baltimore it is really sad what has not been said it is sad that a great and historic city like baltimore has fallen victim to where one in eight of its population some 80 000 are drug and heroine addicts it is sad that in the last 10 years hundreds and thousands of african american young people were slaughtered on the streets of this city our nations capital when they let this community really be neglected it is sad too that sometimes my side of the aisle offers tough love and it is not as warm and fuzzy and cozy as cuddling and gohaveanotherenjoyabledoityourselftime no consequences we do not say that we say you have to be responsible the government has to be responsible we cannot let the nations capital fall into disrepair nor can we let the nations finances fall into disrepair some of that has been tough love it is a lot easier to vote for things here and it is a lot easier to say we are going to be lax and we are going to let everybody do their thing but we have to be responsible the president of the united states unfortunately i think has left a legacy that is going to haunt us for many years i can tell you i have never faced a greater challenge than working with my colleagues the gentleman from new york the gentleman from indiana the speaker of the house others in the other body in trying to put this coherent national drug policy back together so much damage has been done that it will take years and years to get us back to where we were even in 1991 i told you the record of success which they call failure 50 percent reduction we have 90 percent and 100 percent increases in some drug use illegal narcotics abuse and use in some substances in a short time in this administration but i look forward to working with my colleagues it is a tough battle it is not a partisan battle republicans make mistakes democrats make mistakes but we must learn by the mistakes of this administration and never let them happen and seize back our community seize back our children and not let another family or child or parent or loved one in this country be victimized by illegal narcotics i wish to thank the staff and you for being tolerant for my second one hour presentation this week but i feel very deeply about this and i am committed to do whatever i can as one member of congress to help us do a better job"], [0.99992835521698, 0.99992835521698, 0, "on monday i took a special order to discuss the importance of the american republic and why it should be preserved today i will continue with that special order when it comes to executive orders it has gotten completely out of hand executive orders may legitimately be used by a president to carry out his constitutionally authorized duties but that would require far fewer orders than modern day presidents have issued as the 20th century comes to a close we find the executive branch willfully and arrogantly using the executive order to deliberately circumvent the legislative body and bragging about it although nearly 100 000 american battle deaths have occurred since world war ii and both big and small wars have been fought almost continuously there has not been a congressional declaration of war since 1941 our presidents now fight wars not only without explicit congressional approval but also in the name of the united nations with our troops now serving under foreign commanders our presidents have assured us that u n authorization is all that is needed to send our troops into battle the 1973 war powers resolution meant to restrict presidential war powers has either been ignored by our presidents or used to justify war up to 90 days the congress and the people too often have chosen to ignore this problem saying little about the recent bombing in serbia the continual bombing of iraq which has now been going on for over 9 years is virtually ignored if a president can decide on the issue of war without a vote of the congress a representative republic does not exist our president should not have the authority to declare national emergencies and they certainly should not have authority to declare martial law a power the congress has already granted to any future emergency economic and political crises can develop quickly and overly aggressive presidents are only too willing to enhance their own power in dealing with them congress sadly throughout this century has been only too willing to grant authority to our presidents at the sacrifice of its own the idea of separate but equal branches of government has been forgotten and the congress bears much of the responsibility for this trend executive powers in the past 100 years have grown steadily with the creation of agencies that write and enforce their own regulations and with congress allowing the president to use executive orders without restraint but in addition there have been various other special vehicles that our presidents use without congressional oversight for example the exchange stabilization fund set up during the depression has over 34 billion available to be used at the presidents discretion without congressional approval this slush fund grows each year as it is paid interest on the securities it holds it was instrumental in the 50 billion mexican bailout in 1995 the cia is so secretive that even those congressmen privy to its operation have little knowledge of what this secret government actually does around the world we know of course it has been involved in the past 50 years in assassinations and government overthrows on frequent occasions the federal reserve operation which works hand in hand with the administration is not subject to congressional oversight the fed manipulates currency exchange rates controls shortterm interest rates and fixes the gold price all behind closed doors bailing out foreign governments financial corporations and huge banks can all be achieved without congressional approval one hundred years ago when we had a gold standard credit could not be created out of thin air and because a much more limited government philosophy prevailed this could not have been possible today it is hard to even document what goes on let alone expect congress to control it the people should be able to closely monitor the government but as our government grows in size and scope it the government seeks to monitor our every move attacks on our privacy are an incessant and always justified by citing socalled legitimate needs of the state efficiency and law enforcement plans are laid for numerous data banks to record everyones activities a national id card using our social security number is the goal of many and even though we achieved a significant delivery in delaying its final approval last year the promoters will surely persist in their efforts plans are made for a medical data bank to be kept and used against our wishes job banks and details of all our lending activities continue to be of interest to all our national policy agencies to make sure they know exactly where the drug dealers the illegal aliens and tax dodgers are and what they are doing it is argued for national security purposes the echelonsystem of monitoring all overseas phone calls has been introduced yet the details of this program are not available to any inquiring member of congress the government knew very little about each individual american citizen in 1900 but starting with world war i there has been a systematic growth of government surveillance of everyones activities with multiple records being kept today true privacy is essentially a thing of the past the fbi and the irs have been used by various administrations to snoop and harass political opponents and there has been little effort by congress to end this abuse a free society that is a constitutional republic cannot be maintained if privacy is not highly cherished and protected by the government rather than abused by it we can expect it to get worse secretary of defense bill cohen was recently quoted as saying terrorism is escalating to the point that unitedstates citizens may have to choose between civil liberties and more intrusive forms of protection this is all in the name of taking care of us as far as i am concerned we could all do with a lot less government protection and security the offer of government benevolence is the worst reason to sacrifice liberty but we have seen a lot of that during the 20th century probably the most significant change in attitude that occurred in the 20th century was that with respect to life itself although abortion has been performed for hundreds if not for thousands of yearp it was rarely considered an acceptable and routine medical procedure without moral consequence since 1973 abortion in america has become routine and justified by a contorted understanding of the right to privacy the difference between american rejection of abortion at the beginning of the century compared to todays casual acceptance is like night and day although a vocal number of americans express their disgust with abortion on demand our legislative bodies and the courts claim that the procedure is a constitutionally protected right disregarding all scientific evidence and legal precedents that recognize the unborn as a legal living entity deserving protection of the law ironically the greatest proponents of abortion are the same ones who advocate imprisonment for anyone who disturbs the natural habitat of a toad this loss of respect for human life in the latter half of the 20th century has yet to have its full impact on our society without a deep concern for life and with the casual disposing of living human fetuses respect for liberty is greatly diminished this has allowed a subtle but real justification for those who commit violent acts against fellow human beings it should surprise no one that a teenager delivering a term newborn is capable of throwing the child away in a garbage dumpster the new mother in this circumstance is acting consistently knowing that if an abortion is done just before a delivery it is legally justified and the abortionist is paid to kill the child sale of fetal parts to taxsupported institutions is now an accepted practice this moral dilemma that our society has encountered over the past 40 years if not resolved in the favor of life will make it impossible for a system of laws to protect the life and liberty of any citizen we can expect senseless violence to continue as the sense of worth is undermined children know that mothers and sisters when distraught have abortions to solve the problem of an unwanted pregnancy distraught teenagers in coping with this behavior are now prone to use violence against others or themselves when provoked or confused this tendency is made worse because they see in this age of abortion their own lives as having less value thus destroying selfesteem the prime reason government is organized in a free society is to protect life not to protect those who take life today not only do we protect the abortionist we take taxpayers funds to pay for abortions domestically as well as overseas this egregious policy will continue to plague us well into the 21st century a free society designed to protect life and liberty is incompatible with government sanctions and financing abortion on demand it should not be a surprise to anyone that as abortion became more acceptable our society be litical correctness affirmative action came more violent and less free the the americans with disability act the irony is that roe v wade justified tax code and others place a burden on abortion using the privacy argument the two parties struggling to transact conveniently forgetting that not pro business tecting the innocent unborn is the the epa osha and governmentmost serious violation of privacy pos generated litigation also interferes sible with voluntary contracts at times it if the location of the fetus is the jus seems a miracle that our society tification for legalized killing the pri adapts and continues to perform reavacy of our homes would permit the sonably well in spite of the many bukilling of the newborn the deformed reaucratic dictates and the elderly a direction unfortu as the 20th centurycomes to a close nately in

value of nomic arguments for euthanasia that voluntary contracts to one that excesis mercy killing for the benefit of the sively interferes with them although budget planners already we hear these the interference is greater in economic economic arguments for killing the el associations than in social the prinderly and terminally ill ciple is the same already we see the last year the house made a serious political correctness movement intererror by trying to federalize the crime fering with social and religious assoof killing a fetus occurring in an act of ciations data banks are set up to keep violence the stated goal was to em records on everyone especially groups phasize that the fetus deserved legal with strong religious views and anyprotection under the law and indeed body to be so

only a minor problem now after 100 pervasive intervention years of progressive government interone hundred years ago it was gen vention in dealing with guns and drugs erally conceded that one extremely im with thousands of laws and regulaportant function of government was to tions we have more gun violence and a enforce contracts made voluntarily in huge drug problem the marketplace today government before the social authoritarians denotoriously interferes with almost cided to reform the gun and drug culevery voluntary economic transaction ture they amended the constitution consumerism labor laws wage stand enacting alcohol prohibition prohibiar ds hiring and firing regulations po tion failed to reduce alcohol usage and a crime wave resulted after 14 years the american people demanded repeal of this social engineering amendment and got it prohibition prompted the production of poor quality alcohol with serious health consequences while respect for the law was lost as it was flagrantly violated at least at that time the american people believed the constitution had to be amended to prohibit the use of alcohol something that is entirely ignored today in the federal governments effort to stop drug usage in spite of the obvious failure of alcohol prohibition the federal government after its repeal turned its sights on gun ownership and drug usage the many federal antigun laws written since 1934 along with the constant threat of outright registration and confiscation have put the fbi and the batf at odds with millions of law abiding citizens who believe the constitution is explicit in granting the right of gun ownership to all nonviolent americans 1300 our government pursued alcohol prohibition in the 1920s and confiscation of gold in the 1930s so it is logical to conclude that our government is quite capable of confiscating all privatelyowned firearms that has not yet occurred but as we move into the next century many in washington advocate just that and would do it if they did not think the american people would revolt just as they did against alcohol prohibition throughout this century there has been a move toward drug prohibition starting with the harrison act of 1912 the first federal marijuana law was pushed through by fdr in 1938 but the real war on drugs has been fought with intensity for the past 30 years hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent and not only is there no evidence of reduced drug usage we have instead seen a tremendous increase many deaths have occurred from overdoses of street drugs since there is no quality control or labeling crime as a consequence of drug prohibition has skyrocketed and our prisons are overflowing many prisoners are nonviolent and should be treated as patients with addictions not as criminals irrational mandatory minimum sentences have caused a great deal of harm we have nonviolent drug offenders doing life sentences and there is no room to incarcerate the rapists and murderers with drugs and needles illegal the unintended consequence of the spread of aids and hepatitis through dirty needles has put a greater burden on the taxpayers who are forced to care for the victims this ridiculous system that offers a jail cell for a sick addict rather than treatment has pushed many a young girl into prostitution to pay for the drugs priced hundreds of times higher than they are worth but the drug dealers love the system and dread a new approach when we finally decide that drug prohibition has been no more successful than alcohol prohibition the drug dealers will disappear the monster drug problem we have created is compounded by moves to tax citizens so government can hand out free needles to drug addicts who are breaking the law in hopes that there will be less spread of hepatitis and aids in order to reduce government health care costs this proposal shows how bankrupt we are at coming to grips with this problem and it seems we will never learn tobacco is about to be categorized as a drug and prohibition of sorts imposed this will make the drug war seem small if we continue to expand the tobacco war talk about insane government policies of the 20th century tobacco policy wins the prize first we subsidize tobacco in response to demands by the special interests knowing full well even from the beginning that tobacco had many negative health consequences then we spend taxpayers money warning the people of its dangers without stopping the subsidies government then pays for the care of those who choose to smoke despite the known dangers and warnings but it does not stop there the trial lawyers lobby saw to it that the local government entities could sue tobacco companies for reimbursement of the excess costs that they were bearing in taking care of smokingrelated illnesses and the only way this could be paid for was to place a tax on those people who did not smoke how could such silliness go on for so long for one reason we as a nation have forgotten the basic precept of a free society that all citizens must be responsible for their own acts if one smokes and gets sick that is the prob lem of the one making the decision to smoke or take any other risk for that matter not the innocent taxpayers who have already been forced to pay for the tobacco subsidies and government health warning ads beneficiaries of this monstrous policy havebeen tobacco farmers tobacco manufacturers politicians bureaucrats smokers health organizations and physicians and especially the trial lawyers who suffers the innocent taxpayers that have no choice in the matter and who acted responsibly and chose not to smoke think of what it would mean if we followed this simple logic and implemented a federal social program similar to the current war on smoking designed to reduce the spread of aids within the gay community astoundingly we have done the opposite by making aids a politically correct disease there was certainly a different attitude a hundred years ago regarding those with sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis compared to the special status given aids victims today it is said that an interventionist economy is needed to make society fair to everyone we need no more government fairness campaigns egalitarianism never works and inevitably penalizes the innocent government in a free society is supposed to protect the innocent encourage selfreliance and impose equal justice while allowing everyone to benefit from their own effort and suffer the consequences of their own acts a free and independent people need no authoritarian central government dictating eating drinking gambling sexual or smoking habits when the rules are required they should come from the government closest to home as it once did prior to americas illfated 20th century experiment with alcohol prohibition let us hope we show more common sense in the 21st century in these matters than we did in the 20th a compulsive attitude by politicians to regulate nonviolent behavior may be well intentioned but leads to many unintended consequences legislation passed in the second half of the 20th century dealing with drugs and personal habits has been the driving force behind the unconstitutional seizure and forfeiture laws and the loss of financial privacy the war on drugs is the most important driving force behind the national police state the excuse given for calling in the army helicopters and tanks at the waco disaster was that the authorities had evidence of an amphetamine lab on the davidian property this was never proven but nevertheless it gave the legal cover but not the proper constitutional authority for escalating the attack on the davidians which led to the senseless killing of so many innocent people the attitudes surrounding this entire issue needs to change we should never turn over the job of dealing with bad habits to our federal government that is a recipe for disaster america has not only changed technologically in the last 100 years but our social attitudes and personal philosophies have changed as well we have less respect for life and less love for liberty we are obsessed with material things along with rowdy and raucous entertainment needs and wants have become rights for both poor and rich the idea of instant gratification too often guides our actions and when satisfaction is not forthcoming anger and violence breaks out road rage and airline passenger rage are seen more frequently regardless of fault a bad outcome in almost anything even if beyond human control will prompt a lawsuit too many believe they deserve to win the lottery and a lawsuit helps the odds unfortunately the only winners too often are the lawyers hyping the litigation few americans are convinced anymore that productive effort is the most important factor in economic success and personal satisfaction one did not get rich in the 1990s investing in companies that had significant or modest earnings the most successful investors bought companies that had no earnings and the gambling paid off big this attitude cannot create perpetual wealth and must some day end today financial gurus are obsessed with speculation in the next initial public offering and express no interest in the cause of liberty without which markets cannot exist lying and cheating are now acceptable by the majority this was not true 100 years ago when moral standards were higher the october 1999 issue of unitedstates news and world report reveals that 84 percent of college students believe cheating is necessary to get ahead in todays world and 90 percent are convinced there is no price to pay for the cheating not surprisingly 90 percent of college students do not believe politicians and an equal number of percentage believes the media cheats as well there is no way to know if this problem is this bad in the general population but these statistics indicate our young people do not trust our politicians or media trust has been replaced with a satisfaction in the materialism that speculative stock markets borrowing money and a spendthrift gov ernment can generate what happens to our society if the material abundance which we enjoy is ephemeral and human trust is lost social disorder will surely result and there will be a clamor for a more authoritarian government this scenario may indeed threaten the stability of our social order and significantly undermine all our constitutional protections but there is no law or ethics committee that will solve this problem of diminishing trust and honesty that is a problem of the heart mind and character to be dealt with by each individual citizen the importance of the family unit today has been greatly diminished compared to the close of the 19th century now fewer people get married more divorces occur and the number of children born out of wedlock continues to rise tax penalties are placed on married couples illegitimacy and single parenthood are rewarded by government subsidies and we find many authoritarians arguing that the definition of marriage should change in order to allow nonhusband and wife couples to qualify for welfare handouts the welfare system has mocked the concept of marriage in the name of political correctness economic egalitarianism and heterophobia freedom of speech is still cherished in america but the political correctness movement has seriously undermined dissent on our university campuses a conservative or libertarian black intellectual is clearly not treated with the same respect afforded an authoritarian black spokesman we now hear of individuals being sent to psychiatrists when personal and social views are crude or out of the ordinary it was commonplace in the soviet system to incarcerate political dissenters in socalled mental institutions those who received a soviet government designation of socially undesirable elements were stripped of their rights will this be the way we treat political dissent in the future we hear of people losing their jobs because of socially undesirable thoughts or for telling offcolor jokes today sensitivity courses are routinely required in america to mold social thinking for the simplest of infractions the thought police are all around us it is a bad sign any academic discussion questioning the wisdom of our policies surrounding world war ii is met with shrill accusations of antisemitism and nazi lover no one is ever even permitted without derision by the media the university intellectuals and the politicians to ask why the united states allied itself with the murdering soviets and then turned over eastern europe to them while usheringin a 45year saberrattling dangerous cold war period free speech is permitted in our universities for those who do not threaten the status quo of welfarism globalism corporatism and a financial system that provides great benefit to the powerful special interests if a university professor does not follow the party line he does not receive tenure we find ourselves at the close of this century realizing all our standards have been undermined a monetary standard for our money is gone the dollar is whatever the government tells us it is there is no definition and no promise to pay anything for the notes issued ad infinitum by the government standards for education are continually lowered deemphasizing excellence relative ethics are promoted and moral absolutes are ridictfled the influence of religion on our standards is frowned upon and replaced by secular humanistic standards the work ethic has been replaced by a welfare ethic based on need not effort strict standards required for an elite military force are gone and our lack of readiness reflects this standards of behavior of our professional athletes seem to reflect the rules followed in the ring by the professional wrestlers where anything goes managed medical care driven by government decrees has reduced its qual ity and virtually ruined the doctorpatient relationship movie and tv standards are so low that our young peoples senses are totally numbed by them standards of courtesy on highways airplanes and shops are seriously compromised and at times leads to senseless violence with the acceptance of abortion our standards for life have become totally arbitrary as they have become for liberty endorsing the arbitrary use of force by our government morally justifies the direct use of force by disgruntled groups not satisfied with the slower government process the standards for honesty and truth have certainly deteriorated during the past 100 years property ownership has been undermined through environmental regulations and excessive taxation true ownership of property no longer exists there has been a systematic undermining of legal and constitutional principles once followed and respected for the protection of individual liberty a society cannot continue in a state of moral anarchy moral anarchy will lead to political anarchy a society without clearly understood standards of conduct cannot remain stable any more than an architect can design and build a sturdy skyscraper with measuring instruments that change in value each day we recently lost a nasa space probe because someone failed to convert inches to centimeters a simple but deadly mistake in measuring physical standards if we as a people debase our moral standards the american republic will meet a similarfate many americans agree that this country is facing a moral crisis that has been especially manifested in the closing decade of the 21st century our presidents personal conduct the characters of our politicians in general the caliber of the arts movies and television and our legal system have reflected this crisis the personal conduct of many of our professional athletes and movie stars has been less than praiseworthy some politicians sensing this have pushed hard to write and strictly enforce numerous laws regarding personal nonviolent behavior with the hope that the people will become more moral this has not happened but has filled our prisons this year it will cost more than 40 billion to run our prison system the prison population nearing 2 million is up 70 percent in the last decade and twothirds of the inmates did not commit an act of violence mandatory minimum drug sentencing laws have been instrumental in this trend laws clearly cannot alter moral behavior and if it is attempted it creates bigger problems only individuals with moral convictions ban make society moral but the law does reflect the general consensus of the people regarding force and aggression which is a moral issue government can be directed to restrain and punish violent aggressive citizens or it can use aggressive force to rule the people redistribute wealth and make citizens follow certain moral standards and force them to practice certain personal habits once government is permitted to do the latter even in a limited sense the guiding principle of an authoritarian government is established and its power and influence over the people will steadily grow at the expense of personal liberty no matter how wellintentioned the authoritarian government always abuses its powers in its effort to achieve an egalitarian society the principle of inequality that freedom recognizes and protects is lost government then instead of being an obstruction to violence becomes the biggest perpetrator this invites all the special interests to manipulate the monopoly and evil use of government power twenty thousand lobbyists currently swarm washington seeking special advantage that is where we find ourselves today although government cannot and should not try to make people better in the personal moral sense proper law should have a moral nonaggressive basis to it no lying cheating stealing killing injuring or threatening government then would be limited to protecting contracts people and property while guaranteeing all personal nonviolent behavior even the controversial although there are degrees in various authoritarian societies as to how much power a government may wield once government is given the authority to wield power it does so in an everincreasing manner the pressure to use government authority to run the economy in our lives depends on several factors these include a basic understanding of personal liberty respect for a constitutional republic economic myths ignorance and misplaced good intentions in every society there are always those waiting in the wings for an opportunity to show how brilliant they are as they lust for power convinced that they know what is best for everyone but the defenders of liberty know that what is best for everyone is to be left alone with a government limited to stopping aggressive behavior the 20th century has produced socialist dictators the world over from stalin hitler and mao to pol pot castro and ho chi minh more than 200 million people died as a result of bad ideas of these evil men each and every one of these dictators despised the principle of private property ownership which then undermined all the other liberties cherished by the people it is argued that the united states and now the world have learned a third way something between extreme socialism and meanspirited capitalism but this is a dream the socalled friendly third way endorses 100 percent the principle that government authority can be used to direct our lives and the economy once this is accepted the principle that man alone is responsible for his salvation and his life on earth which serves as the foundation for free market capitalism is rejected the third way of friendly welfarism or soft fascism where government and businesses are seen as partners undermines and sets the stage for authoritarian socialism personal liberty cannot be preserved if we remain on the course at which we find ourselves at the close of the 20th century in our early history it was understood that a free society embraced both personal civil liberties and economic liberties during the 20th century this unified concept of freedom has been undermined today we have one group talking about economic freedom while interfering with our personal liberty and the other group condemning economic liberty while preaching the need to protect personal civil liberties both groups reject liberty 50 percent of the time that leaves very few who defend liberty all the time sadly there are too few in this country who today understand and defend liberty in both areas a common debate that we hear occurs over how we can write laws protecting normal speech and at the same time limiting commercial speech as if they were two entirely different things many americans wonder why congress pays so little attention to the constitution and are bewildered as to how so much inappropriate legislation gets passed but the constitution is not entirely ignored it is used correctly at times when it is convenient and satisfies a particular goal but never consistently acrosstheboard on all legislation two the constitution is all too frequently made to say exactly what the authors of special legislation want it to say that is the modern way language can be made relative to our times but without a precise understanding and respect for the supreme law of the land that is the constitution it no longer serves as the guide for the rule of law in its place we have substituted the rule of man and the special interests that is how we have arrived at the close of this century without a clear understanding or belief in the cardinal principles of the constitution the separation of powers and the principle of federalism instead we are rushing toward a powerful executive centralized control and a congress greatly diminished in importance executive orders agency regulations federal court rulings unratified international agreements direct government economy and foreign policy congress has truly been reduced in status and importance over the past 100 years when the peoples voices are heard it is done indirectly through polling allowing our leaders to decide how far they can go without stirring up the people but this is opposite to what the constitution was supposed to do it was meant to protect the rights of the minority from the dictates of the majority the majority vote of the powerful and influential was never meant to rule the people we may not have a king telling us which trees we can cut down today but we do have a government bureaucracy and a pervasive threat of litigation by radical environmentalists who keep us from cutting our own trees digging a drainage ditch or filling a puddle all at the expense of private property ownership the key element in a free society is that individuals should wield control of their lives receiving the benefits and suffering the consequences of all their acts once the individual becomes a pawn of the state whether a monarchor a majorityruled state a free society can no longer endure we are dangerously close to that happening in america even in the midst of plenty and with the appearance of contentment if individual liberty iscarelessly snuffed out the creative energy needed for productive pursuits will dissipate government produces nothing and in its effort to redistribute wealth can only destroy it freedom too often is rejected especially in the midst of plenty when there is a belief that government largesse will last forever this is true because it is tough to accept personal responsibility practice the work ethic and follow the rules of peaceful coexistence with our fellow man continuous vigilance against the wouldbe tyrants who promise security at minimum cost must be maintained the temptation is great to accept the notion that everyone can be a beneficiary of the caring state and a winner of the lottery or a class action lawsuit but history has proven there is never a shortage of authoritarians benevolent of course quite willing to tell others how to live for their own good a little sacrifice of personal liberty is a small price to pay for longtime security it is too often argued i have good friends who are in basic agreement with my analysis of the current state of the american republic but argue it is a waste of time and effort to try and change the direction in which we are going no one will listen they argue besides the development of a strong centralized authoritarian government is too far along to reverse the trends of the 20th century why waste time in congress when so few people care about liberty they ask the masses they point out are interested only in being taken care of and the elite want to keep receiving the special benefits allotted to them through special interest legislation i understand the odds and i am not naive enough to believe the effort to preserve liberty is a cake walk i am very much aware of my own limitations in achieving this goal but ideas based on sound and moral principles do have consequences and powerful ideas can make major consequences beyond our wildest dreams our founders clearly understood this and they knew they would be successful even against the overwhelming odds they faced they described this steady confidence they shared with each other when hopes were dim as divine providence good ideas can have good results and we must remember bad ideas can have bad results it is crucial to understand that vague and confusing idealism pro duces mediocre results especially when it is up against a determined effort to promote an authoritarian system that is sold to the people as conciliatory and nonconfrontational a compromise they say between the two extremes but it must be remembered that no matter how it is portrayed when big government systematically and steadily undermines individual rights and economic liberty it is still a powerful but negative idea and it will not fade away easily ideas of liberty are a great threat to those who enjoy planning the economy and running other peoples lives the good news is that our numbers are growing more americans than ever before are very much aware of what is going on in washington and how on a daily basis their liberties are being undermined there are more intellectual think tanks than ever before promoting the market economy private property ownership and personal liberty the large majority of americans are sick and tired of being overtaxed and despise the income tax and the inheritance tax the majority of americans know government programs fail to achieve their goals and waste huge sums of money a smoldering resentment against the unfairness of government and efforts to force equality on us can inspire violence but instead it should be used to encourage an honest system of equal justice based on individual not collective rights sentiment is moving in the direction of challenging the status quo of the welfare and international warfare state the internet has given hope to millions who have felt their voices were not being heard and this influence is just beginning the three major networks and conventional government propaganda no longer control the information now available to everyone with a computer the only way the supporters of big government can stop the internet will be to tax regulate and monitor it although it is a major undertaking plans are already being laid to do precisely that big government proponents are anxious to make the tax on the internet an international tax as advocated by the united nations apply the eschelon principle used to monitor all overseas phone calls to the internet and prevent the development of private encryption that would guarantee privacy on the internet these battles have just begun if the civil libertarians and free market proponents do not win this fight to keep the internet free and private the tools for undermining authoritarian government will be greatly reduced victory for liberty will probably elude us for decades the excuse they will give for controlling the internet will be to stop pornography catch drug dealers mpnitor child molesters and do many other socalled good things we should not be deceived we have faced tough odds but to avoid battle or believe there is a place to escape to someplace else in the world would concede victory to those who endorse authoritarian government the grand experiment in human liberty must not be abandoned a renewed hope and understanding of liberty is what we need as we move into the 21st century a perfectly free society we know cannot be achieved and the ideal perfect socialism is an oxymoron pursuing that goal throughout the 20th century has already caused untold suffering the clear goal of a free society must be understood and sought or the vision of the authoritarians will face little resistance and will easily fill the void there are precise goals congress should work for even under todays difficult circumstances it must preserve in the best manner possible voluntary options to failed government programs we must legalize freedom to the maximum extent possible 1 complete police protection is impossible therefore we must preserve the right to own weapons in selfdefense 2 in order to maintain economic protection against government debasement of the currency gold ownership must be preserved something taken away from the american people during the depression 3 adequate retirement protection by the government is limited if not ultimately impossible we must allow every citizen the opportunity to control all of his or her retirement funds 4 government education has clearly failed we must guarantee the right of families to home school or send their kids to private schools and help them with tax credits 5 government snoops must be stopped we must work to protect all privacy especially on the internet prevent the national id card and stop the development of all government data banks 6 federal police functions are unconstitutional and increasingly abusive we should disarm all federal bureaucrats and return the police function to local authorities 7 the army was never meant to be used in local policing activities we must firmly prevent our presidents from using the military in local law enforcement operations which is now being planned for under the guise of fighting terrorism 8 foreign military intervention by our presidents in recent years to police the american empire is a costly failure foreign military intervention should not be permitted without explicit congressional approval 9 competition in all elections should be guaranteed and the monopoly powers gained by the two major parties through unfair signature requirements high fees and campaign donation controls should be removed competitive parties should be allowed in all governmentsponsored debate 10 we must do whatever is possible to help instill a spirit of love for freedom and recognize that our liberties depend on responsible individuals not the group or the collective or the society as a whole the individual is the building block of a free and prosperous social order the founders knew full well that the concept of liberty was fragile and could easily be undermined they worried about the dangers that lay ahead as we move into the new century it is an appropriate time to rethink the principles upon which a free society rest jefferson concerned about the future wrote yes we did produce a nearperfect republic but will they keep it or will they in the enjoyment of plenty lose the memory of freedom material abundance without character is the path of destruction they that he refers to are we and the future is now freedom jefferson knew would produce plenty and with material abundance it is easy to forget the responsibility the citizens of a free society must assume if freedom and prosperity are to continue the key element for thq republics survival for jefferson was the character of the people something no set of laws can instill the question today is not that of abundance but of character respect for others and their liberty and their property it is the character of the people that determines the proper role for government in a free society samuel adams likewise warned future generations he referred to good manners as the vital ingredient that a free society needs to survive adams said neither the wisest constitution nor the wisest laws will secure the liberty and happiness of a people whose manners are universally corrupt the message is clear if we lose our love of liberty and our manners become corrupt character is lost and so is the republic but character is determined by free will and personal choice by each of us individually character can be restored or cast aside at a whim the choice is ours alone and our leaders should show the way some who are every bit as concerned as i am about our future and the pervasive corrupt influence in our government in every aspect of our lives offer other solutions some say to solve the problem all we have to do iswrite more detailed laws dealing with campaign finance reform ignoring how this might undermine the principles of liberty similarly others argue that what is needed is merely to place tighter restrictions on the lobbyists in order to minimize their influence but they fail to realize this undermines our constitutional right to petition our government for redress of grievances and there are others with equally good intentions that insist on writing even more laws and regulations punishing nonviolent behavior in order to teach good manners and instill character but they fail to see that tolerating nonviolent behavior even when stupid and dangerous to ones own self is the same as our freedom to express unpopular political and offensive ideas and to promote and practice religion in any way one chooses resorting to writing more laws with the intent of instilling good character and good manners in the people is anathema to liberty the love of liberty can come only from within and is dependent on a stable family and a society that seeks the brotherhood of man through voluntary and charitable means and there are others who believe that government force is legitimate in promoting what they call fair redistribution the proponents of this course have failed to read history and instead adhere to economic myths they ignore the evidence that these efforts to help their fellow man will inevitably fail instead it will do the opposite and lead to the impoverishment of many but more importantly if left unchecked this approach will destroy liberty by undermining the concept of private property ownership and free markets the bedrock of economic prosperity none of these alternatives will work character and good manners are not a government problem they reflect individual attitudes that can only be changed by individuals themselves freedom allows virtue and excellence to blossom when government takes on the role of promoting virtue illegitimate government force is used and tyrants quickly appear on the scene to do the job virtue and excellence become illusive and we find instead that the government officials become corrupt and freedom is lost the very ingredient required for promoting virtue harmony and the brotherhood of man let us hope and pray that our political focus will soon shift toward preserving liberty and individual responsibility and away from authoritarianism the future of the american republic depends on it let us not forget that the american dream depends on keeping alive the spirit of liberty"], [0.9999256134033203, 0.9999256134033203, 0, "it is good to come to the floor again tonight to talk about a subject which i try to address the house on each tuesday if possible but at least once a week to come before the forefront of the house of representatives and the american people what i have as a congressional responsibility and that is the issue of illegal narcotics and our national drug control policy in this session of congress i have been responsible as chairman of the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources for helping to bring together a coherent national drug policy and also carry forward a program started by the new majority to restart the war on drugs i will talk about what has happened with the socalled war on drugs in my remarks tonight i will try to review a little bit of some of the current controversy concerning the war on drugs and how to attack the problem of illegal narcotics and drugs and then to trace some of the history and problems we were not able to get into last week particularly on how we got ourselves into this situation with colombia and the current situation with panama that has made the news with many of our operations being closed down there not only from a military standpoint but also from the standpoint of trying to curtail illegal narcotics from their source from panama as a forward operating location tonight i feel a little bit caught between the left and the right on the issue of illegal narcotics i took over the chairmanship and responsibility of trying to develop a policy that would be more effective and inherited that responsibility as i said before from the gentleman from illinois who is now the speaker of the house who did a tremendous job in restarting our national effort to combat illegal narcotics i took on this responsibility without a whole lot of preconceived notions but again a philosophy that is probably on the tough side of the agenda in dealing with illegal narcotics but i found myself again this week sort of attacked a little bit from the right and a little bit from the left on the issue both by some national columnists and some local columnists we have done our best to provide an open honest forum in our subcommittee hearings to intelligently discuss the options at hand and look at things that we have done in the past relating to illegal narcotics and our approach and see what went wrong and how we go forward because this problem does have an incredible social cost as i have said it is not just dollars and cents but there is a human cost in tragedies across this nation there are hundreds of thousands of people nearly 2 million americans in jail and some 70 or 80 percent of them are there because of illegal narcotics crime activities there have been 15 200plus deaths up almost 8 percent over the previous year druginduced deaths the social cost is estimated at a quarter of a trillion dollars a tremendous social cost in the problem of drug abuse and illegal narcotics and then the cost to our judicial system our health care system our economic system with lost unemployment not to mention lost opportunities for so many americans but as i said i am trapped a little bit tonight between the right and left some aresaying that we have to learn to live with drugs such as ethan nadelmann who wrote this story which actually appears today in the washington post i think it is a national column mr nadelmann is director of the lindesmith center a drug policy institute with offices in new york and chicago i am told he is funded by mr soros and some others who have advocated a little bit more liberal drug policy approach he does attack the current approach to illegal narcotics and he says in his article lets start by dropping the zero tolerance rhetoric and policies and the illusionary goal of drugfree societies i think we have only to look at comparing and i have done this before a zero tolerance tough enforcement approach versus a more liberal approach laissezfaire towards illegal narcotics we have good examples in the united states and i have cited them before one of course is baltimore i have had this chart up several times before baltimore adopted sometime ago a very laissezfaire liberal drug approach much as has been advocated by the administration in this budget battle that we have had in the past few weeks in funding the district of columbia one of the 13 appropriations measures we must pass to fund the government and a federal responsibility but tucked in within that legislation to fund the government were provisions to liberalize needle exchange to liberalize some of the approaches to marijuana and a more liberal approach towards what are now illegal narcotics we cite again a great example of baltimore which in 1996 had almost 39 000 drug addicts this is the liberal approach now they have gone from 39 000 in 1996 to somewhere in the range of 60 000 today so today we have one in 10 and a city council person whom i have quoted before from baltimore on the city council there has estimated that the real figures may be closer to one in eight if we took this model and we have a population of the united states we will say rounded off to 270 million 280 million people and if we had one in 10 our nation using this model would have some 27 million to 28 million people addicted to drugs not only do we have the problem of drug addiction we have the continual problem of death and other incredible costs social costs baltimore is one of the few major cities that did not have a reduction in deaths in fact it remained the same from 1997 and in 1998 the figures were 312 deaths in the city for a liberal policy so we had a huge increase in addiction with the liberalization this is an example of that liberal policy the zero tolerance policy which is bashed in mr nadelmanns column today advocating again dropping this zero tolerance rhetoric zero tolerance rudy giuliani the mayor of new york has employed that and it has worked very well we have gone from over 2 200 deaths to 629 deaths again think of baltimore which has a small population 600 000 and 15 times that population in new york city and half the deaths in baltimore 312 in one year versus 629 for a city of a multimillion population this is the zero tolerance policy mr nadelmann would like us to drop in his article today on the liberal side i think this is part of the flaw of his reasoning on this again we have some pretty hard evidence here he goes on and i would like to also cite his article intodays washington post he says with some foresight today drug policymakers might finally grasp that their relentless efforts to eradicate coca crops have little impact on availability price or use of cocaine anywhere in the world this is his statement today november 2 i just wanted to share with my colleagues and the american people the latest information i have today this chart actually was provided to me this afternoon by the vice president of bolivia who was visitingwashington he met with me this afternoon he presented this chart again the same day this article appears he says the policymakers might finally grasp their relentless efforts to eradicate coca crops have little impact on the availability well here is a project that the gentleman from illinois started several years ago when the republicans gained control of the majority as we can see in the early nineties we saw some decrease this is under the bush administration the end of the bush administration we see the beginning of the clinton administration where we see the increase in coca cultivation what happened here is that the international programs were cut by the democrat majority now they had a complete majority to do basically anything they wanted to in the house of representatives and in the senate and president clinton controlled the executive agency so what they did in fact was slash the budgets for the number one responsibility which was stopping the production at their source the most costeffective so we saw an increase in production in the clinton years 1993 over here to where the republicans take over in 1995 it took us from 1995 to 1996 really to get in place a very costeffective program i asked the vice president how much american money would you estimate that has gone into coca eradication and alternative crop programs and it is about 30 or 40 million over the past several years so with very few lollars out of 17 8 bili=~i 30 or 40 million in several years and again if we go back to what happened in the bush administration we could trace this back to the reagan administration in very few years we have cut for almost no money in comparison to what we are spending these huge amounts on for other efforts we have cut coca cultivation again mr nadelmann is wrong his facts are wrong the production in just bolivia is cut some 50 percent in 2 or 3 years and we have a program working with them now with very few dollars to eradicate the production now if i put up peru peru and bolivia they accounted for about 90 percent of all the coca cultivation back in the beginning here in the 1992 area when the clinton administration took over bolivia has had a 50 percent reduction peru has had a 60 percent reduction both have tough zero tolerance policies and both with a little bit of help from their friends very little unitedstates money but a determination for a zero tolerance for going after coca cultivation the only chart that we would show where there has been an increase in cultivation would of course be colombia where the administration blocked assistance aid and stopped everything for a number of years we saw that soar until just the last year they have awakened to the problem that they have created through their policy of not stopping drugs at their source again we have been able to affect this we have also been able to affect the consumption and use of cocaine which has dropped and again another chart shows the longterm prevalence of cocaine use here we saw in the reagan administration this levelling out a dropping under bush the bush administration and again the beginning of an increase when president clinton took over and now we see a drop in 1998 for the first time we are seeing a drop again because of the decrease in availability of cocaine particularly from peru and bolivia where we have been successful however we have been unsuccessful in colombia where the administration has fought every attempt to get resources and assistance there for the past several years and turned colombia from a nonproducer it was a transit and processing country into a producer of cocaine so i think both of these charts demonstrate exactly what has happened when you have a tough policy and when you have eradication programs that are costeffective in countries such as the bolivia model here and the peruvian model which would be very similar to what is shown here and presented by the vice president of bolivia to me today so again hit from the left by mr nadelmann we do search for the most cost effective means to deal with this problem but i think he has missed the point again based on the facts and information that we have then a good friend who is a local columnist but also a national columnist charlie reese who is well respected from the conservative side last week he gave us a broad side on the narcotics issue he said what do prohibition and drug war have in common is his question sure failure one of his comments is if we ended the war on drugs legalized these drugs and allowed people to buy them by prescription or from carefully licensed and regulated dealers would everyone in the united states go to haites and everyone become an addict well again i will cite one of the best examples we have of a liberal policy which i think will soon be changed after this election in baltimore because of the devastation that it has done in that community but we have seen an addiction problem turn from a small problem into an incredible problem where 1 in 10 are some of our official statistics but 1 in 8 again according to elected local official there are now addicts now addicts do not come cheap they have a tremendous cost on the health system on society dealing with their addiction i would imagine if we compared the cost of dealing with someone who is addicted and has an addiction problem and again their lost productivity their health problems supporting their addiction loss to their families and employment economic opportunity i think we would see a very serious charge in cost to society we have seen that with the degradation of the community both from an economic standpoint and from a lifestyle standpoint in baltimore so i can answer the question for mr reese does everyone become an addict no everyone will not become an addict but 1 in 10 might become subject to addiction under this liberalized policy there are some countries where they have tried to liberalize some of the access to drugs like marijuana and i would cite here the netherlands the netherlands has legalized in small quantities they did try this marjuana it is sold across the counter in limited quantities as i said in talking with officials recently from the netherlands we found first of all they have reduced the amount that is available secondly they have not only reduced the amount but they have increased the penalties they have gotten tougher on enforcement because they found that theliberal approach did not work and others that took advantage of this situation they found themselves also with higher addiction rates so we have one example of one narcotic both with tremendous problems and both with trying it and then backing off from it that is just dealing with marijuana mr reese in his article goes on to say there is nothing inherently evil in morphine heroin marijuana or cocaine they each produce certain effects just as other drugs do but those effects do not cause people to commit crimes here again i would have to differ with my good friend and columnist on the conservative side mr reese we know that these drugs do cause some veryserious side effects i try to cite not only the statistics in the druginduced deaths some 15 200 we were up to last year the societal costs which i have cited again tonight but then some of the other cases that are not reported we took the case i believe it was baby sabrina where the father allegedly was high on cocaine according to some tapes that were obtained the baby everyone in florida and around the country was concerned about its disappearance and we find that the child may in fact have been a victim of a parent who was involved with cocaine the sheppard case which is so celebrated the antigay case in wyoming is another case if one reads below the lines the individuals involved there admit to being high on narcotics and alcohol i am certain that that influenced their action the new jersey bus driver we cited who was under the influence of marijuana and some 20plus people died in that bus accident plus we have seen what crack cocaine and the effects of other illegal narcotics have upon people so i would have to disagree with mr reese that the effects do not cause people to commit crime he says what causes the crime is drug prohibition again i would have to disagree with him not to mention the tremendous problem we have with growing illegal narcotics which is methamphetamine now methamphetamine is so common that it has become epidemic through the midwest and through the west much of it produced we have found through our subcommittee hearings and investigations in mexico and finding its way into the united states but we find that in fact methamphetamine and some other drugs where they have done these brain scans a normal brain as shown here a brain on meth for a short period of time one can already see the change in some of the brain activities the next figure here shows meth after some continued use it almost patterns the last image here which is parkinsons disease so we know that certain illegal narcotics and that is why they are illegal have very serious damage to the bodies and the brain this is what can happen so we do have this problem in dealing with illegal narcotics so i am a little bit hit from the right a little bit hit by the left on the issue we are trying to find out what are viable solutions we have looked at the questions of decriminalization of treating some of the drug problem more as a health problem but that has very serious cost implications we have also seen that as we take the liberal turn we have increased addiction we have a serious problem with our treatment programs in that very few of them are effective the first time around and sometimes the second and third time around and sometimes not at all so we increase the level of addiction we increase the level of potential people who cannot be helped and who have become wards and charges because of their addiction to the state and to the federal government of course to communities and families throughout the country so we do take a very serious look at trying to find alternatives to the current way we go after illegal narcotics and drug abuse but again nothing can be more effective than stopping illegal narcotics at their source and stopping the production at their source and then stopping illegal narcotics before they get to our borders once they get to our borders it is pretty much a tough situation for law enforcement one time a dea agent described this to me when i was visiting in south america he said mr mica this is a little bit like having a garden hose and having a sprinkler with a 360degree radius he said you can get cans and go out and try to catch all of the sprinkles from that 360degree sprinkler or he says you can come up here to the hose and you can choke the water at its source and it stops that is a little bit of what our federal responsibility is with limited number of dollars we try to stop the illegal narcotics first at their source and then as they leave the source once it gets to the streets and into the communities and schools neighborhoods it is almost impossible for our enforcement people to handle but we do find that where we do have the zero tolerance policies that we have a much better success rate in dealing with the problem and stemming addiction stemming illegal activity with again zero tolerance as opposed to the liberalized policy which has been advocated now that brings us to the point that i also raise about what has taken place the war on drugs basically was closed down in 1993 with the advent of the clinton administration with the advent of a majority in both the house and senate if we look at the areas again that i have talked about tonight the international areas of spending we see again the first responsibility and most cost effective way to deal with illegal narcotics is to stop them at their source this chart shows again 1991 1992 in the bush administration advent of the clinton administration the cutting of international programs federal drug spending on international programs that is stopping drugs at their source declined 21 percent in 1 year after the clinton administration took office federal drug spending decreased from 660 million in 1992 to 523 million in 1993 this chart shows exactly what took place there now this is one key element to stopping drugs at their source the other one as i said is the interdiction program and that is stopping drugs as they come from the source the same thing happened again we have in the beginning of this chart here the expenditures during the end of the bush administration the beginning of the clinton administration the clinton administration the republican congress in interdiction federal drug spending on interdiction declined 23 percent 1 year after the clinton administration took office federal drug spending decreased from 1 96 billion in 1992 to 1 5 billion in 1993 so basically we closed down the two primary areas of federal responsibility we cannot have state and local governments and other communities really dealing with these source countries or getting drugs stopped at the border that is clearly a federal responsibility what is interesting is if we took these charts and we took drug use and i have had this chart up once before that our staff produced but these are exact statistics again the reagan administration it says reagan administration right here we go into thebush administration a decline in the prevalence of drug use this is all drugs then we see the bush administration ending and the clinton administration the change in policy the change in stopping drugs at their source from coming into the country we saw a flood of drugs coming in we saw the end of programs to stop drugs at their source that was a federal war on drugs that basically ended we see this dramatic increase this chart again every american and every member of congress should be aware of we get to the beginning of the republican administration where we have restored money back to the 1991 1992 levels and small amounts of money in comparison to an 18 billion program this is maybe 5 percent 10 percent of that entire program expended on a source country and also on interdiction but this shows without a doubt that that policy does not work that we did not have a war on drugs that when we have a war on drugs we see a decline and when we do not have one we see an increase when we have more of a zero tolerance policy the same thing the same pattern occurs so again in those areas we have not met our responsibility or at least the old majority did not meet their responsibility the new majority did and we are trying to put things back to the 19911992 level as far as our efforts to keep illegal narcotics coming into our country what is interesting is we often hear and some of the liberal columnists and the liberal side also say that we should just spend more money on treatment and that was part of the mantra of the clinton experiment that failed federal drug spending on treatment programs increased 37 percent during the clinton administration in 1992 to 1993 we went from 2 2 billion to 3 2 billion now i will say that i believe treatment is very important we have had problems with programs not having high success rates and with high failures rates we do need to sort through that there is nothing wrong with spending every available dollar we can on treatment programs but in fact that was the policy that we had here and we see the decreases in the two areas which i mentioned that are so important and then the emphasis on just treatment federal drug spending on treatment increased 12 percent from 1993 to 1995 even under the new republican administration and we are accused sometimes of reducing spending too much in this important area we have had a 12 percent increase from the time we took responsibility here to the current fanding year so we have continued to put money into treatment all through this period but again a change in emphasis so those are some of the points that i wanted to make about the war on drugs being a failure again being attacked by the right and being attacked by the left and some of those folks in between but we have as a new majority tried to act responsibly we have put some of these programs back together under a republicancontrolled congress under the new majority federal drug spending on interdiction was increased 84 percent from 1995 to 1999 and that was to get us back to the level of 1991 and 1992 spending federal drug spending on international programs stopping illegal narcotics from their source to our borders was increased 170 percent during the republicancontrolled congress from 1995 to 1999 again getting us back to the levels that we were at when we so effectively dealt with the problem of illegal narcotics now we all know that we have been able to curtail some illegal narcotics coming into the united states and i demonstrated tonight two examples very costeffective examples both in bolivia and peru i have also spoken about colombia right now about 70 percent of the illegal cocaine and heroin coming into the united states comes from colombia how did we get into a situation where colombia which some 6 years ago was really not even on the radar screen as far as production of coca for cocaine or production of heroin in fact there was almost no heroin produced in colombia i think it was a series of very strategic errors by this administration that got us to the situation we are in and let me cite a little bit of the history of how we got to where we are with colombia now being the source of about 70plus percent of the hard narcotics coming into the country in 1994 the clinton administration stopped providing information and intelligence to the colombians regarding drug flights tracked by the united states which eliminated the effectiveness of colombias shootdown policy so a very sharp directive by the clinton administration a change in policy first stopping in 1994 the providing of informationsharing the colombians were using information and intelligence we gave them to go so far as to shoot down those trafficking in illegal narcotics this is the first step in the beginning of the disaster that we are now inheriting and the american taxpayers will have the tab for in a few more weeks once we get passed this current appropriations discussion and resolution the next step in this failed policy of bringing colombia to the forefront of illegal narcotics production and activity was in 1996 and 1997 the clinton administration distorted the certification law that congress had passed back in the mid1980s and decertified colombia because the administration said colombia was not doing enough in the fight against drugs effectively stopping all united states antinarcotics assistance to colombia now we passed in the mid1980s a law that was called the decertification law that basically says that each year the administration must assess if countries are assisting in one stopping the production and two stopping the trafficking of illegal narcotics that is what must be certified if they are certified as cooperating then they are eligible for united states foreign aid financial assistance and trade benefits however we provided in that law and i remember working on the law with senator hawkins and others in the mid1980s when it was passed a national security interest waiver and certainly it is in the national security interest of the united states to make certain that assistance to a country like colombia which was producing illegal narcotics and was a source of illegal narcotics might be decertified because some of their officials were not cooperating but also we could grant a waiver which would allow us to continue giving resources just for the fight against illegal nar cotics so a law that was carefully crafted to take into consideration situations like colombia was ignored by the administration in 1996 and 1997 the administration blocked every bit of assistance into colombia so first we had the 1994 shootdown policy and informationsharing policy fiasco and then in 1996 and 1997 a distortion and misapplication of the decertification law by the clinton administration what did that harvest what were the results what we did here after a tremendous amount of effort in 1998 last year after pressure from many members of congress on both sides of the aisle when we saw what was happening we finally got colombia certified with a national interest waiver so that equipment and resources could go to colombia to fight the war on drugs there and again we have to remember that they stopped all of the assistance going into colombia from basically 199394 to 1998 the results were devastating for colombia in fact according to a new york times article published october 25 a few weeks ago 35 000 colombians have been killed in the past decade because of the countrys internal conflict and the conflict there is marxist terrorist groups financed by illegal narcotics activities according to an orlando sentinel article published october 10 23 000 people were slain in colombia in 1998 alone so if we look at the results from 1996 to 1998 when we stopped all of the aide and assistance we had 23 000 people killed in colombia alone in that 1 year the colombia national police reported that since 1990 approximately 4 600 colombian policemen have been killed in the line of duty and many of them in fighting against the illegal narcotics trafficking again we withheld aid and assistance for many years according to the new york times another recent article 1 5 million colombians have been misplaced in the last decade because of the countrys internal conflict and i am told in 1 year over 300 000 were displaced a tragedy a disruption of a society equal to bosnia equal to the conflict that we have seen in the balkans in kosovo not only in number of lives taken but in displaced individuals from their homes and their communities now my colleagues might say and i have heard some people say this that i need to tell what the republicans have done to deal with this as i said we put tremendous pressure last year on colombia but to go back to 1994 we urged the change in the policy the shootdown policy and information sharing we finally did get some minor changes in this and just in the last few months the administration has gone back to a policy of providing information sharing but repeatedly time after time we requested the administration to go back to providing assistance what was very sad is during this period of time even resources that we appropriated the president took some of the money we know and diverted it to haiti some of it was diverted to bosnia the vice president i am told directed u2 overflights which provided information so they could go after drug traffickers and the rebel activity there he ordered those u2 planes sent to alaska to check for oil spills in the meantime thousands dead a civil war financed by illegal narcotics profits raging and tremendous disruption so republicans at every juncture and since we took the majority have provided funding assistance and requested the administration to move forward last year we provided 287 million to colombia this morning i was to have a meeting with representatives from the department of state department of defense national security council and others who are involved in expending this money and making certain that it gets to colombia for a report on where that money has been spent unfortunately that was canceled by the administration this morning i think their strategy is to keep as quiet as possible about how the money has been spent to not come forward and answer questions as to why equipment resources and what the congress the republican majority provided to deal with that situation what has been done with those funds and how that has been expended and what has not been done there is also a great reluctance to talk about the 1 5 billion plan that was presented but not officially introduced to the congress some weeks ago to deal with the escalating problems now that the administration faces we face a bosnia and kosovo right in our own backyard here with colombia financed again by narcoterrorists what is sad is i held hearings as recently as august of 1999 and found that helicopters riverine patrol aircraft crop spraying aircraft and support equipment that were supposed to be delivered still had not been delivered and again under the republican congress we provided resources and hard dollars that should have been there as of october 1999 only a fraction of that assistance has been delivered unfortunately again the administration canceled a meeting today to report on what they have done with the balance i think that is partly due to trying to get the congress out of town before they present the congress officially and the american people with a multibilliondollar tab for their mistakes and errors in colombia this is a big business though for the guerillas in colombia they earn according to a reuters report up to 600 million a year profits from the drug trade so the marxist terrorist guerillas are disrupting this country and the region by fueling it and financing it through the profits of illegal narcotics in fact general mccaffrey who is our drug czar has said that there is no line and no distinction between the terrorists and narcoterrorists illegal drug activities so we have now seen what has turned from a minor problem at the beginning of this administration that could have been contained with the proper policy into a major problem and a disruption of the entire region general mccaffrey again our drug czar stated in a hearing that we had the united states has paid inadequate attention to a serious and growing emergency i would like to echo his statement unfortunately now the huge bill and tab comes forward and unfortunately now to this date we still do not have before the congress a solid plan to deal with that and i think they are embarrassed because of the current budget battle and appropriations battle of coming forward with that plan at this point but we are looking for probably a 1 5 billion tab on those mistakes this situation is so serious that last week we had an estimated 2 million people in colombia who went into the streets and demonstrated for peace i wish i could tell those colombians that our policy had not gotten them into this situation but in fact it has and now we are going to pay very dearly i what is sad about the situation in colombia and let me put this up here we have colombia down here and we have mexico through here and we see that narcotics are coming up in colombia through the isthmus of panama central america into mexico this is basically the pattern that we see today i have a little better chart showing colombia specifically and panama this shows some of the guerilla activity but here is panama right here a very strategic location colombia the darkest areas are the opium growing areas here a little bit lighter areas here cocaine now again in 1992 there was almost no production this was mostly a transiting and a processing country and now we see these production areas again i think all beneficiaries of a failed policy but we see the strategic location with panama and again if i had the other chart up here we would see the transiting through mexico into the united states and the sea routes and these circles here showing the guerilla activity and now they control about twothirds of the land area in colombia what is of particular concern to some of us who have responsibility in this area is that this whole problem is now escalating and affecting the region this region produces i am told about 20 percent of all the oil consumed in the united states comes from this region panama who has been a strategic location and we have as of today this headline in the washington post it says unitedstates air force leaves panama a little quiet but finally yesterday the last wave of unitedstates airmen and women pulled out of panama yesterday when howard air force base reverted to panamanian control closing eight decades of unitedstates air power now we had all of our forward operating drug locations out of panama right in this area we have lost that capability in panama what is of concern are the reports that i am getting here is a report from a news account last week it says a leading panamanian clerk says continuing incidents along the border of colombia could affect future panama canal operations and this clerk again his name is romulo emiliani a roman catholic bishop said if panama falls into instability the panama canal could lose its users well in fact yesterday with a news account that i read we did lose our base at howard air force base not only the strategic military location but this was the site of 15 000 annual flights into south america into central america over the drug producing region again we provided information sharing to the colombians the bolivians the peruvians and others to interdict illegal narcotics at their source and we were restarting these again in panama one of the problems we have is we have lost this installation yesterday the last air force folks moved out may 1 all flights stopped that did not come at any small price to the taxpayers the united states is surrendering 70 000 acres of land to panama as they assume control of the canal the united states has also lost 5 600 buildings to panama and the resources at the canal the united states is in fact surrenderixig in the next few days here some 10 to 13 billion dollars in infrastructure to panama there is a great contrast between what the republicans have done on the narcotics issue in panama and the democrats it is ironic to know that some 10 years ago george bush sent american troops into panama because mr noriega the panamanian leader was we know involved in illegal narcotics trafficking and drug smuggling through this region we sent troops in there and actually americans died taking back this area and arresting him and he now is in prison this year the clinton administration is turning back the panama canal what is sad is they have turned the panama canal back to primarily red chinese dominated firms and that would be bad enough by itself but in fact almost everyone who has looked at this say they were illegal or corrupt tenders that allowed the panamanians to give the control both the pacific and caribbean port access to again red chinese interests a great contrast again between what the bush administration did and what the clinton administration is doing in the next few weeks here what is also a particular concern is that again the instability from colombia and this cleric does cite that will influence panama has caused destabilization on the venezuelan side and even equador is having difficulty in keeping these narcoterrorists from invading into their border so we see what has turned into a small problem a big problem the price of moving our forward operating locations from panama now down to manta equador and up to caracas aruba is also of great concern to me as chairman the subcommittee on drug policy it is a concern because right now we only have a fraction of the previous overflights and information so we have the possibility of more illegal narcotics coming into our country when we are trying to in fact restart these programs what concerns me is the administration came forward with their first proposal with 70plus million to move these locations of course we just lost 10 to 13 billion dollars in getting kicked out and losing 5 600 buildings so now we have to replace that with infrastructure and expenditures in equador and also in the netherlands antilles but again we have the administration having failed to negotiate any longterm agreements with either the antilles or with equador we have a shortterm agreement with one for several more months and another one that expires in april then the administration came back after asking for 70plus million and asked for another 40 million i sent some of our staff down to look at what the cost would be and we may be at a quarter of a billion dollars according to our staff report and their investigation of this situation plus not operating at anywhere near full capacity in this arena which is so important now in trying to keep some of this activity curtailed and on the verge of spending 1 5 billion that the administration we expect as the november surprise after congress exits stage right and resolves some of the financial problems that we have right now so that is a little bit of the situation we find ourselves in tonight it is not a pretty scene it is complex both in addressing the drug abuse and illegal narcotics activities in the united states let alone the international problems and challenges we face i am pleased to be joined by the gentleman from indiana"], [0.9999203681945801, 0.9999203681945801, 0, "i rise tonight to pay tribute to americas national heroes and it is appropriate that i give this special order following a 5minute special order given by our friend and colleague from texas because in her special order she paid tribute to two brave citizens of texas two firefighters a man and a woman who gave their lives over the past 24 hours in protecting the people in her district kimberly smith and lewis e mayo who were cited by the gentlewoman from texas are both american heroes unfortunately they gave their lives in the process of protecting other fellow citizens there are millions of people like kimberly smith and lewis e mayo around this country who day in and day out protect america who are always being asked to perform the impossible whether it be responding to a house fire a large factory fire like we saw in massachusetts late last year that killed a multiple number of firefighters or single family fires like we saw last summer in d c where three d c firefighters were killed the gentlemanfrom maryland and i came down here for that service but we tend to as a nation take these losses for granted and we tend to take these people for granted and that is the topic of my discussion tonight each year in america we lose on average 100 men and women who are involved in fire and life safety across this country who are killed in the course of protecting their communities now the interesting or i would say outrageous fact is that out of the 100 or so people that are killed each year the bulk of them are volunteers there is no other group of people in america who volunteer their time who each year and who see upwards of 100 of their colleagues killed in the course of doing their volunteer work yet that is the story of the america fire and life safety service all across this country now we heard the president give a typical speech last month during the state of the union and he mentioned a ton of different groups in fact he promised 172 billion of new programs to every group we can think of he talked about our law enforcement he talked about our teachers he talked about our military he talked about those people who need special help in america but in that 1 hour and 30 minute speech president clinton did not mention our national heroes one time he did not mention the firefighters or the ems personnel who are killed all across this country every year he did not mention that there are 1 2 million men and women who every day in 32 000 departments protect america he did not say a word about what they have been doing for a period of time that is older than the country itself and largely that time has been given by volunteers he did not mention the fact that these people are now being asked to perform additional responsibilities and even though many of us believe that fire and ems services are a local responsibility which i believe fully we are now tasking these people to take actions that some would say are federal in responsibility when one asks local fire and ems organizations to respond to terrorist incidents when they are asked to respond to an incident involving a weapon of mass destruction a chemical biological or perhaps a nuclear agent then there is a federal responsibility to help train and assist these individuals now the fire service in this country is a proud tradition i know because i would not be involved in politics today were it not for the fire service having been born and raised into a fire service family like my six older brothers and my father before me i got involved in the volunteer fire company in my hometown and eventually became president and then chief of that fire company i went back to school in the evenings while teaching during the day and got a degree in fire protection and then for 3 years as a volunteer i ran the training program for the 78 fire companies in my home county i understand who these people are because i have been one i have traveled to all 50 states where i have interacted with the leaders of these organizations and i have seen the faces of these men and women who day in and day out give so much of themselves to protect their neighborhoods to protect their neighbors and to protect the people who live and work in the area that they serve in the urban areas they are typically paid and in the suburban and rural areas they are typically volunteer but they are all professionals they are trained they are equipped and they are prepared to respond each year i want to reiterate 100 of them on average give their lives as the two just did in the past 24 hours in houston texas yet president clinton made no mention of these people and the challenges that they face in fact not only did he not mention them in the state of the union speech he gave them the ultimate slap in the face the fire and ems community in this country gets a pittance of federal funding from our budget process they get the unitedstates fire administration which is less than 40 million a year and they get the unitedstates fire academy which operates at emmitsburg maryland there is only one entitlement program and one grant program not even an entitlement one grant program to help the volunteer fire companies in this country president clinton had the audacity to submit a budget that cut that program from 3 25 million to 2 5 million no not billions of dollars millions of dollars now as my colleagues know the president sneezes and spends more money than 2 5 million and yet in the budget proposed for this fiscal year he has cut the only program to provide funding for rural fire protection from 3 25 million to 2 5 million that is absolutely unacceptable now there are those as i said and i am one of them who believe that fire and ems services is a local responsibility i am not saying that we should federalize the national fire ems service that would be wrong and it would be a tragic thing if we tried to do it and the fire service would object to that what i am saying is we should provide some support there have been fiscal studies that have been done that shows that if the volunteer fire service in america had to be paid if all of those 32 000 towns across america who rely on their volunteers had to replace them with a paid department the cost to the taxpayers would be in excess of 35 billion 35 billion but these men and women who serve their towns are not asking for 35 billion what they are simply asking for is the respect the consideration and some onetime help in giving them the resources to deal with these new threats that america is facing now let us make some comparisons we provide strong funding for our military almost 300 billion a year and as a member of the national security committee i support that full funding and even more for our nations armed services it is important that we have the best military in the world which we have today because they are constantly put in harms way but almost 300 billion a year for the nations international defenders our military yet less than 30 million a year for our domestic defenders the people who fight the wars on our soil remember these are not just people that fight fires these are people who have responded the first responders to floods hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes hazmat incidents shootings in our inner cities drug deals gone sour they are the first responder to every emergency situation in every town and city across america every disaster we have they are the first in they are there before the police they are there certainly before the emergency management personnel they are always there in advance of our military and their job is to control the situation stabilize the casualties and make sure they control the damage from extending beyond the original impact of the disaster these are americas first responders yet what is our response our response at the federal level is zero many of these people the 85 percent of these 1 2 million who are volunteers go out and raise their money through chicken dinners through tag days on the local street corners by having bake sales and by doing things to raise money and they are proud and it is a proud tradition that they want to continue but there is i believe a need for us to provide a oneshot infusion of dollars to make sure these people who are volunteering continue to volunteer to make sure these people who are being paid have the proper training equipment and resources to meet the challenges they face every day now is that an unusual request well i have mentioned that we fund the military to a number of less than 300 billion a year how about our local police department now law enforcement at the local level is a local responsibility our towns hire the police departments they pay the detectives they buy the patrol cars imagine asking our police to run a tag day to buy a police car or to run a cake bake or have some kind of a chicken dinner to buy police vests no that is not the case in most cases our law enforcement costs are borne by local taxpayers because it is a local responsibility but wait a minute the federal government each year spends over 3 billion for local law enforcement we now have a federal program where we pay for onehalf of the costs of protective vests for police officers across america now i support that program but why is protecting the life of a police officer or a military person that much more important than protecting the lives of those 100 people a year who are killed in the course of serving their communities when most of them are in fact volunteers 3 billion a year for law enforcement that money goes to hire local police we have heard the president stand up on this podium time and time again and talk about putting 100 000 cops on the street putting money into additional detectives and money into police vests well why did the president not mention our national heroes who respond to disasters not even a peep not even a word not even a thank you but it gets more outrageous because this administration just does not get it we might remember a few years ago president clinton went before the american people with this grandiose idea he said we are going to create a program that encourages young people to volunteer in our communities across america this new program is going to be called americorps we are going to encourage young people to get involved a great idea a great concept do members know in traditional liberal fashion the president created a big bureaucracy program called americorps where we actually pay young people pay them to volunteer we actually give them an annual stipend we give them benefits to volunteer the last time i volunteered i did not get paid for it because the word volunteer means you are doing it for free but even if we were going to say pay a person to understand the importance of volunteering would we not think that this americorps program would in some way support the 1 million volunteer fire and ems personnel across the country guess what mr speaker bill clintons americorps program has done nothing for the volunteer fire and emergency services of this country in fact they do not even qualify for the program so here we have 32 000 departments ambulance fire and rescue departments all across the country depending upon people to volunteer for life safety and we create a federal program that does not even recognize those volunteers is that big government liberal philosophy or what we do not even recognize volunteers who were here longer than the country has been a nation over 250 years sometimes i am convinced inside this beltway we just do not get it we think we have all the answers president clinton is going to create a great program called americorps and yet does not do a thing to recognize those million people who are already volunteering and recognize the fact that most of those 32 000 departments across the country are having a terrible problem right now recruiting young people they cannot get people to volunteer did we think to go out and offer to work with them to create incentives and programs to help bring in more volunteers no because it was not a politically correct thing to do we bypassed and ignored the volunteer fire and ems personnel in this country in fact the outrageous act of this administration several years ago when they held a volunteer summit in philadelphia was to not only not include the volunteer fire service but not even invite them i had to raise cain with the white house and threaten to boycott and picket the conference in philadelphia unless the volunteer fire service was included and they finally were we have our priorities wrong here is a group of people who every year for the past 250 years have been all across our country in our smallest rural villages to our largest cities protecting our people and their property yet we have done nothing to recognize those people we have done nothing to pat them on the back and look at how we can provide some shortterm funding to assist them to better serve their communities again let me state i am not advocating that we federalize the fire service that is totally the opposite of what i am advocating what i am saying is that if president clinton is going to reauthorize and request 3 billion a year for the police if he is going to stand before us and demand that we put 1 billion a year on the table for new teachers why does he not say one word about the real american heroes i was a teacher for 7 years in the public schools of pennsylvania i am a strong supporter of public education and teachers in general i support more money for education but is 1 billion for teachers that much more important than perhaps some shortterm stopgap funding for these american heroes who are killed in the line of duty each year or even a mention from the president that these people deserve to be recognized i think not we have our priorities all wrong because the polls are showing the president and some of our colleagues in this congress that education and crime are key issues we want to come up with new ways to throw more money in each of those areas some of it wellfounded and other is wasteful money but not a peep is made of support for those people who day in and day out protect our towns and cities these people again are not just fire fighters of the 1 2 million nationwide in the 32 000 departments 85 percent of whom are volunteer i will remind my colleagues of who these people are i have been to all 50 states from hawaii to alaska from maine to florida from california to washington state these people are the same in every state that i have visited they are not just emergency responders they are the people who rescue the cats stuck in the tree they are the people who pump the cellars out when they are flooded they are the people who organize the search parties when the child has been lost they are the people who organize the july 4th celebrations memorial day parades the local organization that runs the christmas party for disadvantaged kids at christmastime they are the people who collect the money in the boots for muscular dystrophy they are the people whose place of operation we go to to vote on election day it is the place where young couples hold their wedding receptions in every town in america the men and women of the fire service are the backbone of the community they are the heart and soul of this country they are the same people who teach in our sunday schools who work in our synagogues they are the same people who coach our youth programs they are the same people who run our girl scout and boy scout programs across america there is no single group of people in this country that i can think of that better represents what america is all about whether they be paid or volunteer they provide a service for our citizens and they do so asking nothing in return they do not have highpriced lobbyists on the hill because all the ones who are volunteers have fulltime jobs they do their fulltime job during the day or they work shift work at night and then when they are not working they go over and work on the trucks they run the fundraising events they hold the organizational meetings they establish the budgets and they run their local organizations and keep their towns strong they are facing serious challenges today recruiting has become extremely difficult in every volunteer department in this nation the communications system for our emergency responders is a total and complete disaster imagine if you will i had the chief of the oklahoma city fire department appear before my subcommittee 1 year on the date after the bombing of the murrah building in oklahoma city chief marrs who is a friend of mine sat at the table testifying before my subcommittee i asked him i said chief are you better off today as a chief of that department than you were 1 year ago when the bombing took place he said congressman i am no better off today than i was 1 year ago the problems are just as real let me just review one problem that every department in america is facing today because it is outrageous there is no common communication frequency so that fire and ems personnel can communicate freely one with the other in the case of the murrah building bombing chief marrs testified that when they arrived on the scene with this huge building having been demolished on one side there were frantic calls for life safety for more ambulances for paramedics for structural engineers yet they did not have radios that could communicate between ems fire police and other agencies being brought in because they were all on different frequencies so they had to resort to cellular telephones chief marrs testified that those cellular phones quickly became overtaxed and they finally had to resort to writing messages down on pieces of paper and having fire and ems personnel carry the message from one officer to another to inform him of an order or of a plan of action here we are in the ending of the 20th century the beginning of the 21st century and our fire and ems leaders have to resort to handcarrying messages because the communications system they have nationwide is an absolute disaster the departments around d c many of them are parttime paid and fully volunteer if they have to get involved in assisting the d c fire department which is totally paid and a very efficient department i might add under chief tippet if they have to assist them they do not have common frequencies so they cannot talk to each other so here we are talking about incidents involving the life safety of thousands of our citizens all across america and yet we do not have a common communications system that our fire and ems personnel can use one might ask the question what role does the federal government play in that process as we know it is the federal government through the fcc that issues the licensing for frequencies to be used by everyone in america we should follow through and we should provide the support for a common set of frequencies for all fire and ems personnel nationwide we should provide support funding on a oneshot basis to allow local departments to come in line with that standard frequency system training our fire and ems personnel are being asked across the country today by the department of defense and the department of justice to train their men and women most of whom are volunteers as to how to respond if they suspect that a chemical or biological agent has been used imagine not only are we asking these people to protect our towns from the usual disasters floods hurricanes tornadoes fires hazmat incidents accidents now we are saying to them at the federal level they have another responsibility they have to be prepared and know what to do if a chemical biological or nuclear agent is put forth in our community so we are trying to train them the bulk of our 32 000 departments in america do not have the resources to continue that training beyond the one time that the department of justice and department of defense comes in and shows them the proper process to use the bulk of our 32 000 departments in america do not have the dollars to buy a 15 000 specialized turnout suit that can be used in a chemicalbio environment let alone maintain it the bulk of the 32 000 departments in america do not have the ability to buy detectors to detect a chemical or a biological agent so they can warn the people to evacuate the area what happens when they do not have that equipment we saw the result of that kind of event in japan just a few short years ago when a rogue terrorist group dispersed sarin and that sarin gas wiped out the entire group of first responders because they did not have the proper equipment nor the proper training to deal with that situation involving a weapon of mass destruction training is critically important and resources are critically important if our local emergency responders do not have this they are not going to be able to continue to protect our towns what can we do mr speaker i am not advocating a bigticket giveaway program i am not advocating creating a system where the fire and ems service in this country becomes a part or an arm of the federal government i am advocating that we take some steps to put a shortterm infusion of dollars into this group of people nationwide there are a number of options we could for instance create a lowinterest loan program five states already have lowinterest loan programs my state of pennsylvania has one in fact in pennsylvania every piece of fire equipment bought by each of our 2 400 volunteer fire companies is financed with a lowinterest loan in the history of the program we have not had one default as the speaker pro tempore well knows because he is from pennsylvania and he has been a tireless advocate for the fire service as i have back in our state we have not had one default on a loan by a volunteer fire company in purchasing a 500 000 pumper or a 750 000 aerial truck the fire service is a proud organization it pays its bills but having a national lowinterest loan program could provide lowcost money for these small departments to be able to buy the equipment they so desperately need and also to help our big cities modernize their departments with equipment as well we could deal with the communications problem and provide that oneshot infusion of funds to standardize a national system of communication we can provide funding for detectors for chemical and biological incidents and turnout suits for these situations so that they are properly protected li 2000 we could create a grant program a oneshot grant program that would be available to every fire department in america and every ems and ambulance service in america to allow them to upgrade their equipment or make their own choices about what was the top priority in their own community above all we need to make sure we have a focus on health and safety because killing 100 fire and ems personnel in a year in america is unacceptable if we had a situation involving our military where 100 military personnel were killed it would be a national outrage it would be a national scandal it would be front page news that 100 men and women were killed in the course of performing their responsibilities as soldiers every year every year on average 100 men and women who serve this country as paid and volunteer fire and ems personnel are killed where is the outrage mr speaker i have had the privilege in october for 3 or 4 years over the past 10 years of traveling to emmitsburg maryland where we have the national fallen fire fighters memorial the times i have been there we have usually had between 115 and 125 families of fire and ems personnel who have been killed some years it is above 100 some years it is slightly below 100 but on average it is 100 it is absolutely heartbreaking to see these families of fire fighters and ems personnel who were killed while protecting their towns the gentlewoman from texas paid tribute to two of them today two from houston a man and a woman who were killed in the past 24 hours they leave their families behind their loved ones a tragic story it is even more tragic when they are volunteers when they do it not as their primary job but as an avocation to protect their town they raise the money to buy the equipment to pay for the training to serve their town for free there is no other group of people in america that does that this president in all the grandeur of the state of the union in the eight times he has given it did not mention what he would do for this group of people one time not one mention in fact in this years budget as i started out he made the ultimate slap in the face of these men and women by cutting the rural volunteer program from a level of 3 25 million or 3 5 million whatever it is to 2 5 million which is absolutely outrageous now there is some money in the fema budget for a program that has not yet been defined i have been told by one bureaucrat that it is a program that has been favored by one of the assistants at fema carey brown to do education for fire prevention in innercity impoverished areas now that is important but does that really address the needs of the american fire service i think not there has been legislation introduced which i am a cosponsor of to provide funding for the fire and ems personnel in this country there is one bill that has overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle in fact over 240 cosponsors that would authorize a billion dollars for the fire and ems of this country i think it is going to be extremely difficult if not impossible to get a billion dollars in a year where the balanced budget is such a difficult process to keep on track at a minimum we have to provide some shortterm support to allow these men and women to know that we do care about them that we do want them to continue to volunteer in their towns and that be they paid or volunteer we want to provide support for them in the way of communications systems in the way of health and life safety in the way of training in the way of equipment in the way of proper apparatus that is the least we can do so as members of congress come to the floor over the next several months and rail about an extra billion dollars for teachers more teachers for the classroom as they come on this floor and rail about billions of dollars for local police because we need to keep the crime rate down and i support many of those initiatives i ask my colleagues to step back and think for a moment are the men and women who serve this country largely as volunteers and who give 100 of their colleagues every year any less important than teachers or police or even our military i think not and i would ask my colleagues as we go through this session to work with me in crafting an acceptable bill that is supported by democrats and republicans that will lay down a onetime infusion of dollars to help the men and women of the american fire service it does not have to be a billion dollars because to try to pass something that we all know is impossible is only falsely raising the expectations of that 1 2 million group out there who is waiting for us to do something i think we should start with a reasonable amount i would be happy if we could come up with a package of 100 million there is supposedly a 20 billion item of money that we can use for special priorities this year and yet still keep our budget balanced because of the way the economy is going i do not want to take 20 billion i do not even think we could get a billion but it is absolutely essential that this congress this year pass a piece of legislation that shows the real american heroes americas domestic defenders americas first responders that we care about them that we want them to have the equipment they need and in the prioritization of things we are not going to forget them like president clinton did 2 weeks ago when he gave the state of the union or like he did last week when he revealed his budget and cut the only program that benefits them by somewhere close to a million dollars i ask my colleagues to support me in this effort i thank all the members of the fire and ems caucus over 340 of them in the house and the senate for paying attention now i say it is time to respond i would ask our colleagues to join in this response together"], [0.9999109506607056, 0.9999109506607056, 0, "took us factually up to a certain point pertaining to the job search this is chart no 1 that you have before you this puts it in perspective a little bit and just for a brief review you go back in the calendar back into october that is when ms lewinsky sends the president her wish list for a list of jobs and then shortly after that ms currie faxes lewinsky the resume to ambassador richardson and ambassador richardson gets involved in the job search october 30 the president promised to arrange a meeting between lewinsky and jordan this was set up in november it was actually november 5 but preceding that there was a job offer at the united nations extended to ms lewinsky ms lewinsky decided that she was not interested in a job at the united nations she wanted to go into the private sector and so that was the purpose on november 5 of the meeting between jordan and lewinsky that is when mr jordan says were in business but the facts will show that there was nothing really done in november and that is when i will get in a little bit more to my presentation and then i will get into december when some things happened there that picked up speed on this issue the obstruction for our purposes started on december 5 1997 and that is when the witness list from the paula jones case was faxed to the presidents lawyers at that point the wheels of obstruction started rolling and they did not stop until the president successfully blocked the truth from coming out in the civil rights case these acts of obstruction included attempts to improperly influence a witness in a civil rights case that is monica lewinskythe procurement and filing of a false affidavit in the case unlawful attempts to influence the testimony of a key witness betty currie the willful concealment of evidence under subpoena in that case which are the gifts of december 28 and illegally influencing the testimony of witnessesthat is the aides who testified before the grand jurybefore the grand jury of the united states each of these areas of obstruction will be covered in my presentation today as i said it began on friday december 5 when the witness list came from the paula jones case shortly thereafter the president learned that the list included monica lewinsky this had to be startling news to the president because if the truth about his relationship with a subordinate employee was known the civil rights case against him would be strengthened and it might have totally changed the outcome but to compound the problem less than a week later judge wright federal district judge in arkansas on december 11 issued an order and that order directed that the president had to answer questions concerning other relationships that he might have had during a particular timeframe with any state or federal employee and when i say relationships i am speaking of sexual relationships so judge wright entered the order that is not in your stack but i have it here it was filed on december 11 in the district court in arkansas and directs the president that he has to answer those questions within a timeframe as mr bryant said which is typical in a civil rights case of this nature the white house knew that monica was on the witness list the president knew that it was likely thatshe would be subpoenaed as a witness and that her truthful testimony would hurt his case what did the president do what he had to do was he made sure that monica lewinskywas on his teamandunder control and then on december 17 the president finally called ms lewinsky to let her know she was on thelist this was acall between 2 and 2 30 in the morning now what happened in the time between the president learning monica lewinsky was on thelist and when he notified her of that fact on december 17 is very important the president during that timeframe talked to his friend his confidante and his problemsolver vernon jordan mr jordan had come to the presidents rescue on previous occasions he was instrumental in securing consulting contracts for mr webb hubbell while mr hubbell was under investigation by the independent counsel let me parenthetically go to that point right before mr hubbell announced his resignation from the justice department during that timeframe there was a meeting at the white house in which the president the first lady and others were present after that meeting vernonjordan agreedtohelp obtain financial assistance for mr hubbell mr jordan then introduned mr hubbell tothe right people the introduction was successful and mr hubbell obtained a 100 000 contract the right people that mr jordan contacted happened to be the sameright people for both mr hubbell and ultimately for monica lewinsky which is the parent company of revlon so the president was aware that mr jordan had the contacts and the track record to be of assistance to the president in delicate matters now lets go back a little monica lewinsky had been looking for a goodpaying and highprofile job innew york since the previous july as i pointed out she had been offered a job at the united nations but she wanted to work in the private sector she was not having much success and then in early november it was betty currie who arranged a meeting with vernonjordan which was ultimately on november 5 at this meeting ms lewinsky met with mr jordan for about 20 minutes now lets refer to mr vernon jordans grand jury testimony on that meeting that occurred on november 5 and you have that and it should be your chart no 2 or exhibit 2 as mr jordan testified before the federal grand jury on march 3 1998 in reference to the november 5 meeting he testifies i have no recollection of an early november meeting with ms monica lewinsky i have absolutely no recollection of it and i have no record of it he goes on to testify at page 76 of the grand jury testimony question is it fair to say that back in november getting monica lewinsky a job on any fast pace was not any priority of yours his answer i think thats fair to say now lets stop therefor a moment what happened as a result of this meeting no actionfollowed whatsoever no job interviews were arranged and there were no further contacts with mr jordan mr jordan made no effort to find a job for ms lewinsky for over a month indeed it was so unimportant to him thathe had no recollection of an early november meeting and in fact he testified finding her a job was not a priority and then you will see that during this timeframe the presidents attitude was exactly the same and so look at the same exhibit 2 the last item on that chart where it refers to monica lewinskys grand jury testimony and there she is referring to a december 6 meeting with the president i think i said that i was supposed to get in touch with mr jordan the previous week and that things did not work out and that nothing had really happened yet and the question was did the president say what he was going to do the answer il think he said he wouldyou know this was sort of typical of him to sort of say oh ill talk to him ill get on it so you can see from that thatit wasnot a high priorityfor the president either it was sure ill get to that i will do that it was clear from monica lewinsky that nothing was happening but then the presidents attitude suddenly changed what started out as a favor for betty currie dramatically changed after ms lewinsky became a witness and the judges order was issued again on december 11 and at that time the president talked personallypersonallyto mr jordan and requested his help in getting ms lewinsky a job and that would be again back on exhibit2 on that chart the third item of testimony there back to mr jordan his grand jury testimony may 5 1998 the question is but what is also clear is that as of this date december l1th you are clear that at that point you had made a decision that you would try to make some calls to help get her a job his answer there is no question about that and so what triggeredlets look at the chain of events the witness list came in the judges order came in that triggered the president to action and the president triggered vernon jordan into action that chain reaction here is what moved the job search along now if we had mr jordan on the witness standwhich i hope to be able to call mr jordanyou would need to probe where his loyalties lie listen to the tone of his voice look into his eyesand determine the truthfulness of his statements you must decide whether he is telling the truth or withholding information and so lets go to exhibit 3 in your booklet again recalling mr jordan he testifies about that meeting he testifies in his march 3 1998 grand jury testimony i am certain after the llth that i had a conversation with the president and as a part of that conversation i said to him that betty currie had called me about monica lewinsky andthe conversation was that he knew about her situation which wasthat she was pushed out of the white house that shewanted to go to new york and he thanked me for helping her remember what else happened on that day again the same day that judge wright ruled that the questions about other relationships could be asked by the jones attorneys now lets go back again to mr jordans testimony what does he say about the involvement of the president of the unitedstatea in regard to these jobs you look atexhibit 4 thatisin your booklet this is agaiir vernon jordans grand jury transcript of june 9 1998 now the question is on a different issue the question is about why did he tell the white housen that frank carterfrank carter was the attorney for monica lewinsky that vernon jor dan arranged and introduced to monica lewinsky he was hired and at whatever point he was terminated thenvernon jordan notified the president so the question relates to that why are you trying to tell someone at the white house that this has happened answer thought they had a right to know question why and here is the answer that is critical for my point the president asked me to get monica lewinsky a job i got her a lawyer the drudge reportis out and she has new counsel i thought that was information that they ought to have the president asked me to get monica lewinsky a job clear straightforward testimony no doubt about it then go on down to page 58 of his grand jury testimony of june 9 the question why did you think the president needed to know that frank carter had been replaced answer information he knew that i had gotten her a job he knew that i had gotten her a lawyer information he was interested in this matter he is the source of it coming to my attention in the first place he is the source of it coming to my attention in the first place remember he had already met with betty currie nothing was happening in the november timeframe nothing was happening vernon jordanit was not a priority then the president of the united states called him and it became a priority and that is who he was acting for in trying to get monica lewinsky a job at this point we do not know all that the president was telling vernon jordan but we do know that there were numerous calls back and forth between mr jordan and the president there were numerous calls being made by mr jordan on behalf of monica lewinsky searching for a job and that despite the fact that monica lewinsky did not know that she was witnessedshe did not know she was a witnessthe president knew that she was a witness during his intensified efforts to get her a job now the presidents counselors have made a defense that the job search started before monica lewinsky was a witness and there was nothing wrong with that my response to that is it is true there is nothing wrong with a public official under the right circumstances helping someone get a job and what might have started out being innocent if you accept that argument crossed the linecrossed the linewhenever it was tied and interconnected with the presidents desire to get a false affidavit from monica lewinsky and whenever the job is out there and preparing the false affidavit you will see that they are totally interconnected intertwined interrelated and that is where the line has crossed into obstruction for example when the president was waiting on ms lewinsky to sign the false affidavit in the jones case during the critical time in january a problem developed the job interviews were unproductive despite the numerous calls by mr jordan on one particular day monica called mr jordan and said the interview with revlon did not go well mr jordan what did he do he picked up the phone to the ceo ofthe president of the company mr perlman to as vernon jordan testified make things happenif they could happen that is the request from mr jordan to the ceo of a company after a job interview with monica lewinsky did not go well what happened things happened he did he made things happen monica lewinsky got a job the affidavit was signed and the president was informed by mr jordan through betty currie that the mission was accomplished the question here is not why did the president do a favor for an exintern but why did he use the influence of his office to make sure it happened the answer is that he was willing to obstruct impede justice by improperly influencing a witness in order to protect himself in a civil rights case the next step in the obstruction is the false affidavit this is directly related to the job mission the president needed the signature of monica lewinsky on the false affidavit and that was assured by the efforts to secure her a job again the president brought ms lewinsky into the loop on december 17 over 10 days after the witness list was received by the president the president was ready to tell monica the news that timeframe is important he gets the witness list he could have called monica lewinsky immediately but he needed 7 days because he needed to make sure the job situation was in gear and in fact the day after if you look back on exhibit 1 you will see that the day after the december 17 timeframe that she was informed that she was on the witness list the next day she already had lined up job interviews for her so she felt confident but she was notified on december 17 between 2 and 2 30 her phone rang it was the president of the united states the president said that he had seen the witness list in the case and her name was on it ms lewinsky asked what she should do if subpoenaed and the president responded well maybe you can sign an affidavit well how would this work both parties knew that the affidavit would need to be false and misleading in order to accomplish the desired result clearly truthful testimony by monica lewinsky would make her a witness would not keep her away from testifying only a false affidavit would avoid the deposition so look at what i have marked as exhibit 4 1 which is just a review of the key dates on this job search again november 5 was the first meeting between jordan and ms lewinsky in november nothing happened according to jordan not a high priority december 5 the president receives the witness list the 11th things intensify with judge wrights order the l1th the president talks to mr jordan about the job for monica he gets into action on the 17th they are ready to tell monica that she is on the witness list and then on the 19th sheis actually served with a subpoena again remember after she was finally notified it was the next day that she had the job interviews now still we will spend some time on the december 17 conversation the day that monica lewinsky was notified that she was on the witness list during that conversation the president had a very pointed suggestion for ms lewinsky in a suggestion that left no doubt about his purpose and the intended consequences he did not say specifically go in and lie this is something that you will hear and monica lewinsky testified in her grand jury testimony the president never told me to lie how do you tell people to lie you can tell them the facts that they can use that would in substance be a false statement or you can say go in and lie and make up your own false testimony the president chose to give her the ideas as to what she could testify to that would be false but he never said the words you need to go in and lie so what he did say to her was you know you can always say you were coming to see betty or that you were bringing me letters that ladies and gentlemen of the senate is a false representation is a false statement that he is telling ms lewinsky to utter remember at this point the president knows she is a witness and what does he do as evidenced by the testimony of monica lewinsky he encourages her to lie to say you can always say you were coming to see betty or that you were bringing me letters it should also be remembered that the president when questioned about encouraging monica lewinsky to lie has denied these allegations and therefore there is certainly a conflict in the testimony it is our belief that ms lewinskys testimony is credible and she has the motive to tell the truth because of her immunity agreement with the independent counsel where she gets in trouble only if she lies whereas the president has the motive to cover up and to testify falsely in order to understand the significance of this statement made by the president it is necessary to recall the cover stories that the president and ms lewinsky had previously concocted in order to deceive those people who might inquire it was to deceive those people that they worked with the difference in the initial cover stories though to protect the president and monica from an embarrassing personal relationship from friends and coworkers and the media now it is in a different arena with the pending civil rights case and ms lewinsky being on the witness list despite the legal responsibilities the president made the decision to continue the pattern of lying which ultimately became an obstruction of the administration of justice we are still on december 17 when the president called monica at 2 on that particular day to tell her she was on the witness list to remind her of the cover stories monica lewinsky testified when the president brought up the cover story she understood that the two of them would continue their preexisting pattern of deception and it became clear that the president had no intention of making his relationship with a subordinate federal employee an issue in that civil rights case no matter what the federal courts told him he needed to answer and he used lies deceit and deception to carry out that purpose it is interesting to note that the president when he was asked by the grand jury whether he remembered calling monica lewinsky at 2 on that december 17th day responded no sir i dont bdt it is quite possible that that happened when he was asked whether he encouraged monica lewinsky to continue the cover stories of coming to see betty or bringing letters he answered i dont remember exactly what i told her that night this is not a denial and therefore i believe you should accept the testi mony ofmonica lewinsky if you say in your mind well im not going to believe her then you should first give us the opportunity to present this witness so that you as jurors can fairly and honestly determine her credibility as expected 2 days later on december 19 ms lewinsky received a subpoena to testify in the jones case this sets about an immediate flurry of activity there are a series of telephone calls between ms lewinsky vernon jordan the president and his staff you will see this pattern of telephone calls repeated and generated at any point in time when it appears that the truth may be told in the civil rights case now lets look at exhibit 5 which is the activity on friday december 19 this is the day that monica lewinsky is served with a subpoena now after mr jordan is notified that monica lewinsky is served with a subpoena what does he do in the 3 513 52 notation jordan telephones the president and talks to debra schiff his assistant the subpoena is issued monica calls jordan and jordan immediately calls the president lewinsky meets with jordan and requests that jordan notify the president about her subpoena this is at 4 47 presumably in the middle of that meeting at 5 01 the president of the united states telephones mr jordan and jordan notifies the president about ms lewinskys subpoena then that is whenever he arranged for ms lewinskys attorney jordan telephones attorney carter for representation and that night vernon jordan goes to the white house to meet privately with the president on these particular issues now in that meetingand i am speaking of the meeting that happened late that night at the white housemr jordan told the president again that ms lewinsky had been subpoenaed and related to the president the substance and details of his meeting with ms lewinsky it wasnt a casual consideration the details were discussed including her fascination with the president and other such issues this led mr jordan to ask the president about his relationship with ms lewinsky and the response by the president of the united states was the first of many denials to his friends and aides the president stated in his deposition that he does not recall that meeting but you should remind yourselves of the testimony and the description provided by vernon jordan when he said the president has an extraordinary memory in fact we all know that he is world famous for that memory now the subpoena had been delivered but the testimony of monica lewinsky was not scheduled until january 23 and the presidents deposition which was even more critical was not scheduled until january 17 so the president and his team had some time to work the work was not thebusiness of the nation it was the distraction and selfpreservation in the civil rights case under the plan mr jordan would be the buffer he would obtain an attorneymr carterand that attorney would keep mr jordan informed on the progress of the representation including reviewing any copy of the affidavit knowing about the motion to quash and the general progress of the representation all along the way when mr jordan gets information what does he do with that mr jordan keeps the president informed both about the affidavit and the prospects of the job in new york for which ms lewinsky was totally dependent on the help of her friends in high places let me go back again there is nothing wrong with helping somebody get a job but we all know there is one thing forbidden in public office we must avoid quid pro quo which is this is for that but vernon jordan testified he kept the president informed on the status of the false affidavit the job search and the status of ms lewinskys representation why is this just idle chatter with the president of the united states or are these matters the president is vitally interested in and in fact coordinated mr jordan answers this question himself on page 25 of his grand jury testimony where he testified i knew the president was concerned about the affidavit and whether or not it was signed he was obviously that was his march 5 1998 grand jury testimony the president was concerned not just about the affidavit but specifically about whether it was signed the president knew that monica lewinsky was going to make a false affidavit he was so certain of the contents that when monica lewinsky asked ifhewanted to see it he told her no that he had seen 15 ofthem besides the president had suggested the affidavit himself and he trusted mr jordan to be certain to keep things under control in fact that was one of the main purposes of mr jordans continued communication with monica lewinskys attorney frank carter even though mr jordan testifies at one point he never had any substantive discussions on the representation with mr carter he contradicts himself in his march 3 grand jury testimony where he states mr carter at some point told methis is after januarythat she had signed the affidavit that he had filed a motion to quash her subpoena and thati mean there was no reason for accountability but he reassured me that he had things under control mr jordan was aware of the substance of the drafting of the affidavit the representation the motion to quash and even had a part in the redrafting this was clearly important to mr jordan and clearly important to the president now lets go to the time when the false affidavit was actually signed january 5 1998 these will be exhibits 7 8 and 9 in front of you lets go to january 5 this is sort of a summary of what happened on that day ms lewinsky meets with her attorney mr carter for an hour carter drafts the affidavit for ms lewinsky on the deposition in the second paragraph ms lewinsky telephones betty currie stating that she needs to speak to the president that this is about an important matter specifically that she was anxious about something she needed to signan affidavit frank carter drafts the affidavit she is concerned about she calls the president the president returns ms lewinskys call big question should the president return ms lewinskys call he does that day quickly ms lewinsky mentions the affidavit she is signing and offers to show it to the president that is where he says no he had seen 15 others lets go to the next day the next exhibit is january 6 on this particular day ms lewinsky picks up the draft affidavit at 2 08 to 2 10 she delivers that affidavit to whom mr jordan that is after she got it she delivers it to jordan and then at 3 26 mr jordan telephones mr carter at 3 38 mr jordan telephones nancy hernreich of the white house at 3 48 he telephones ms lewinsky about the draft affidavit and at 3 49 you will see in red that both agree to delete a portion of the affidavit that created some implication that maybe she had been alone with the president so mr jordan was very involved in drafting the affidavit and the contents of that and then at 4 19 presumably in response to some of the calls by jordan earlier in the day the president telephones mr jordan and they have a discussion and then mr jordart telephones carter and the conversations go back and forth at the end of the day mr jordan telephones the white house so the affidavit is still in the drafting process lets go tothe next day exhibit 9 monica signs the affidavit here at 10 ms lewinsky signs a false affidavit in mr carters office then she delivers the signed affidavit to mr jordan and then what does he do the usual at 11 58 mr jordan telephones the white house at 5 46 mr jordan telephones the white house at 6 50 mr jordan telephones the white house and tells the president that ms lewinsky signed the affidavit is this important information for the president to know he was vitally interested in it the next day exhibit 10 january 8 after it is signed what is important the next day it was the other part of the arrangement that she has the job interview with macandrews in new york she had that job interview the only problem was that it went poorly very poorly so at 4 48 on this particular day ms lewinsky telephones jordan and advises that the new york interview went very poorly what does mr jordan do he telephones ron perelman the ceo of revlon the subsidiary of mfh to make things happen if they could happen what does he do next jordan telephones ms lewinsky saying im doing the best i can to help you out and they set up another interview for the next day jordan telephones the white house counsels office and in the evening revlon in new york telephones ms lewinsky to set up a followup interview they said the first interview didnt go well but because mr jordan intercedesand why because the false affidavit has been signed and he wants to make sure this is carried out at 9 02 ms lewinsky telephones jordan about the revlon interview in new york and presumably it went better on that particular day then on january 9exhibit 11monica is confirmed that she has the job lewinsky is offered the revlon job in new york and accepts lewinsky telephones jordan and then at 4 14 jordan notifies currie calls betty currie and says mission accomplished and requests that she tell the president jordan notifies the president of lewinskys job offer and says thank you very much mr president and then that evening the president telephones currie and so on but the president is notified that the job has been secured mission accomplished let me ask you a question after i have gone through these exhibits would mr jordan have pushed for a second interview without cooperation on the affidavit would monica lewinsky have received the support and secured the job if she had said i dont want to sign an affidavit i am just going to go in there and tell the truth whatever they ask me i am going to answer i am going to tell the truth does anyone in this room believe that she would have been granted the jobif mr jordan had made that call to get that second interviewthat she would ever have had the help from her friend in high places now the affidavit has been signed the job is secure monica lewinsky is on the team and the president of the united states is armed for the deposition so lets move there just how important was monica lewinskys false affidavit to the presidents deposition lets look what did the presidents attorney robert bennett say about that affidavit to the federal judge during the deposition that false affidavit allowed mr bennett the attorney for mr clinton when talking about the question of whether the relationship between the president and ms lewinskyit allowed him to assert that there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner shape or form with president clinton that is a statement of robert bennetthis representation to the court about that relationship it is a representation that he had to later probably based upon his own professional embarrassment withdraw and to correct that inaccurate part of the record when questioned by his own attorney in the deposition the president stated specifically the key paragraph of ms lewinskys affidavit was absolutely true paragraph 8 of her affidavit states i have never had a sexual relationship with the president if it enters your mind at this point as to what was meant by sexual relationihip please remember that this affidavit was drafted upon a common understanding of that phrase at that point and not based upon any definition used in the deposition of the president i am sure it was the presidents hope and belief that the false affidavit used in the deposition to bolster his own testimony would be the end of the matter but that was not the case we know in life that one lie leads to another and so it is when we attempt to thwart the administration of justiceone obstruction leads to another now we move to another key witness betty currie by the time the president concluded his deposition he knew there were too many details out about his relati6nship with ms lewinsky he knew that the only person who would probably be talking was ms lewinsky herself he knew the cover story that he had carefully created and that was converted into false statements in the affidavit was now in jeopardy and had to be backed at this point by the key witnesses monica lewinsky and betty currie after the deposition the president needed to do two things he had to contact ms lewinsky to see if she was still on the team but he also had to make sure that his secretary betty currie was lying to protect him so lets look at how the concern became a frenzied and concerted effort to keep the holes plugged in the dike lets look at exhibits 12 and 13 what happened on the day the depositionreally the night of the depositionon january 17 the president finishes testifying in the deposition around 4 at 5 38 the president telephones mr jordan at home and then at 7 13 the president telephones ms currie at home at 7 02 the president places a call to mr jordans office and then at 7 13 he gets ms currie at home finally and asks her to meet with him on sunday it is vitally important that he meet with ms currie at this point because he knows his whole operation is coming unglued so the next day on january 18 which is exhibit 13 there is a whole flurry of activity here i am not going to go through all of them you can see the frantic pace at the white house because at 6 11 in the morning the president had some more bad news the drudge report was released and that created a greater flurry then between 11 49 and 2 55 two phone calls were made between mr jordan and the president then at 5 we see the meetings that is on the second page at 5 ms currie meets with the president and the president then tells ms currie to find monica lewinsky the telephone calls were generated and there was no success in that then that evening the president calls ms currie at home to try once again to see if she had found monica but it was on that day that there was that critical meeting on that sunday in the oval office between betty currie and the president of the united states for that reason we need next to hear from betty currie the presidents personal secretary as to what occurred during that most unusual meeting on sunday following the deposition betty currie testified in the grand jury that the president said that he had just been deposed and that the attorneys had asked several questions about monica lewinsky this is a violation of the judges gag order and the president you know made some comments that were not in line but he had some choices to make and he made the wrong choices but lets look at exhibit 14 which covers the series of statements made to ms currie at this point there is the testimony of betty currie she is reciting to the grand jury each of the statements the president made to her after his grand jury testimony the first i was never really alone with monica right second you were always there when monica was there right monica came on to me and i never touched her right i am not going to read each one of those you can read them you have heard those as well but the president is making those simple declaratory statements to her there are three areas that are covered first of all the president makes a case that he was never alone with monica lewinsky second he is making a point to her that she was the aggressor not me the third point he is making i did pothing wrong those are the basic three points of those five statements that the president made to betty currie during betty curries grand jury testimony she was asked whether she believed that the president wished her to agree to the statements lets look at betty currie for a second she is the classical reluctant witness where are her loyalties how would you examine her testimony where is she uncomfortable in her testimony when she is asked the question how does she shift in the chair those are the kind of ways you have to evaluate the truthfulness of the testimony where their loyalties lie and their demeanor during the questioning she was clearly reluctant she was asked a series of questions and she finally acknowledges that the president was intending for her to agree with the statements that were made she says that is correct and that is page 74 of betty curries grand jury testimony when the president testified in the august 17 grand jury he was questioned about his intentions when he made those five statements to ms currie in his office on that sunday and the presidents explanation is as follows to the grand jury the president i thought we were going to be deluged by the press comments and i was trying to refresh my memory about what the facts were then he goes on to testify so i was not trying to get betty currie to say something that was untruthful i was trying to get as much information as quickly as i could ladies and gentlemen of the senate you have to determine what the purpose of those five statements to betty currie were were they to get information or were they to get her to falsely testify when she was called as a witness logic tells us that the presidents argument was that he was just trying to refresh his memory well so much of a novel legal defense argument first consider the presidents options after he left the deposition he could have abided by the judges gag order and not say anything second he could have called betty currie in and asked her an openended question ms currie or betty what do you remember happened the third option was to call her in and to make these declaratory statements violate the judges order and tamper with the anticipated testimony of betty currie that is the course that the president chose he made sure it was a facetoface meeting not a telephone call he made sure that no one else was present he made sure that the meeting was on his territory and in his office where he could feel comfortable and he could utilize the power and prestige of his office to have the greatest influence on her future testimony after ms currie was in the presidents office he made short clear understandable declarative statements telling ms currie what the story was he was not interested in what she knew why because he knew the truth but he did not want ms currie to tell the truth the only way to ensure that was by telling her what to say not asking her what she remembered you do not refresh someones memory by telling that person what he or she remembers and you certainly do not make the declarative statements to someone regarding factual scenarios of which the listener was unaware the statements that were made to her betty currie could not have any possible knowledge about as to whether they were ever alone as to whether she came on to him no this was not any attempt for the president to refresh his recollection it was witness tampering pure and simple understanding the seriousness of the presidents attempting to influence the testimony of ms currie his attorneys have tried to argue that those statements could not constitute obstruction of justice because she had not been subpoenaed and the president did not know that she was a potential witness at this time well the argument is refuted by both the law and the facts the law is clear that a person may be convicted of obstructing justice if he corruptly influenced the testimony of a prospective witness the witness does not actually have to give testimony the witness does not have to be under any subpoena the witness does not have to be on any witness list and so the law is clear secondly lets examine the defense in light of the facts the president himself brought ms currie into the civil rights case as a corroborating witness when he repeatedly used her name in the deposition and just as significantly the president had to be concerned about a looming perjury charge against him in light of his false testimony in the deposition at least six times in that deposition the president challenged the plaintiffs attorneys to question ms currie about the particular issue you dont have it in front of you but you will see it when we distribute the copies of my remarks i will go through those six times at page 58 of the deposition the president when asked whether he was alone with ms lewinsky said that he was not alone with her or that betty currie was there with monica at page 70 when asked about the last time the president saw ms lewinsky he falsely testified he only recalled that she was there to see betty at page 64 he told the jones lawyers to ask betty whether lewinsky was alone with him in the white house or not or with betty in the white house between the late hours at page 65 of the deposition the president was asked whether ms lewinsky sent packages to him and he stated that betty handled the packages at page 72 the president was asked whether he may have assisted in any way with a job search he said he thought betty suggested vernon jordan talk to her at page 74 he said monica asked betty to ask someone to talk to ambassador richardson he asserted betty as a corroborating witness at least six times in the deposition there is no question that ms currie was a prospective witness and the president clearly wanted her to be deposed as a witness as his ask betty testimony demonstrates but there is another fact that thus far has been overlooked and let me draw your attention to this two days before the presidents deposition betty currie receives a call from michael isikoff a reporter with newsweek magazine inquiring about the records the courier records of gifts going from ms lewinsky to the president youve got a news reporter for a national publication two days before the presidents deposition talking to the presidents secretary saying i need to see the courier records at the white house what does betty currie do she testified that she probably told the president this then she tells bruce lindsey but she also goes to see vernon jordan why why would the secretary go see vernon jordan because she had a press inquiry the reason is as we see later on remember this is january 15th what happened on december 28th that we will get to a little bit later december 28th betty currie went and put those gifts under her bed why is she nervous because mike isikoff is calling about the gifts that are presently under her bed and she is nervous i would be nervous and so she goes to see bruce lindsey she goes to see vernon jordan i need help what do i do and she probably told the president it is all breaking loose the house of cards is falling down and she is either going to report to mr jordan or to seek advice from him either way she knows it is serious and it all has legal consequences and she is a witness to it all and not only does betty curries testimony talk about this call from michael isikoff and going to see vernon jordan but vernon jordans testimony confirms the visit as well the president claims he called ms currie in to work on that sunday night only to find out what she knew but the president knew the truth about the relationship and if he told the truth in deposition the day before he would have had no reason to be refreshed by betty currie more importantly the presidents demeanor ms currie9 reaction and the suggested lies clearly prove that the president was not merely interviewing ms currie rather he was looking for corroboration for his false coverup and that is why he coached her he needed a witness for him not against him now lets go to exhibit 5 betty curries testimonyexcuse me exhibit 15 this is betty curries testimony before the grand jury on january 27 1998 and betty currie is asked about this now remember it was on a sunday that betty currie was first called into the white house to go through these five statements this coaching by the president and then she testified to the grand jury question did there come a time after that that you had another conversation with the president about some other news about what was going on that would have been tuesday or wednesdaywhen he called you into the oval office betty curries answer it was tuesday or wednesday i dont remember which one this was either but the best i remember when he called me in the oval office it was sort of a recapitulation of what we had talked about on sundayyou know i was never alone with her that sort of thing question did he pretty much list the sameanswer to my recollection sir yes question and did he say it in sort of the same tone and demeanor that he used the first time he told you on sunday answer the best i remember yes sir and this needs to be emphasized not only was that witness coaching taking place on sunday but it took place a couple days later it was twice repeated by the president to betty currie he needed to have her good and in line this is more than witness tampering it is witness compulsion of false testimony by an employer to a subordinate employee this has nothing to do with facts nothing to do with media inquiries it has to do with keeping his team on board keeping the ship from sinking and hiding the facts that are important at this point we are not talking about hiding personal facts from inquiring minds but an effort to impede the legitimate and necessary functioning of our court system and now lets go to the martin luther king holiday almost exactly a year ago monday january 19 again you will see the example of the frantic search for monica lewinsky did continue exhibit 16 i am not going to go through all of this but i just want to briefly show the frantic activity on this particular day first of all you will see betty currie is trying to fulfill her responsibility to get ahold of ms lewinsky she uses the pager system and she says please call kay at home now kay is the code name that is used for betty currie that is the agreed upon signal and she uses three messages please call kay please call kay please call kay then she starts using different techniques to get her attention its a social call and then she later uses its a family emergency then she later uses its good news she is using every means possible to get the attention of monica lewinsky and then at 8 50 the president telephones currie at home at 8 56 the president telephones jordan at home go on down to 10 56 the president telephones jordan at his office and so what is going on here they are nervous they are afraid it is all breaking loose they are trying to get ahold of monica lewinsky to find out what is going on who she is talking to later that day things continued to destabilize for the president at 4 54 mr jordan learned from the attorney frank carter that he no longer represented ms lewinsky and so mr jordans link had been cut off mr jordan continued to attempt to reach the president or someone at the white house between 4 58 and 5 22 he made six calls trying to get ahold of someone at the white house the president when mr jordan was asked about why he was urgently trying to get ahold of the white house he responded because the president asked me to get monica lewinsky a job and he thought it was information they ought to have jordan finally reaches the president about 6 and tells him that carter had been fired why this flurry of activity it shows how important it was for the president of the united states to find ms lewinsky betty currie was in charge of contacting monica and it could not happen it did not happen ms lewinsky was a coconspirator in hiding this relationship from the federal court and he was losing control over her in fact she ultimately agreed to testify truthfully under penalty of perjury in this matter this was trouble for the president and so now lets continue lets continue exploring the web of obstruction but to do this we have to backtrack to what i have already referred to and that was the incident on december 28 the episode with the gifts on december 28 another brick in the wall of obstruction was laid it was the concealment if evidence ms lewinsky testified that she discussed with the president the fact that she had been subpoenaed and that the subpoena called for her to produce gifts and this is what ms lewinsky was telling the president at the meeting with him on december 28 she testified before the grand jury that she recalled telling the president that the subpoena in question had requested a hatpin and other items and this concerned herthe specificity of it and the president responded it bothered him too well lets look at the testimony of ms lewinsky which is exhibit 17 this is lewinsky testifying about the meeting and then at some point i said to him well you know should imaybe i should put the gifts away outside my house somewhere or give them to someone maybe betty and he sort of saidi think he responded i dont know or let me think about that and left that topic not exactly the response you would hope for or expect from the president but the answer led to acti6n later that day ms lewinsky got a call from ms currie who said i understand you have something to give to me or according to ms lewinsky the president said you have something to give me she wasnt exactly sure of the phrase but it was either i understand you have something to give me what betty currie said or betty currie said the president said you have something to give to me and so ladies and gentlemen if you accept the testimony of monica lewinsky on that point you must conclude that the directive to retrieve the gifts came from the president i will concede that there is a conflict in the testimony on this point with the testimony of betty currie ms currie in her grand jurytestimony had a fuzzy memory a little different recollection she testified that the best she can remember ms lewinsky called her but whenever she was asked further she said that maybe ms lewinskys memory is better than hers on that issue but there is helpful evidence to clear up this discrepancy or this inconsistency monica you will recall in her deposition said she thought that betty had called her and she thought that the call came from her cell phone number well it was not known at the time of the questioning of monica lewinsky but since then the cell phone record was retrieved and you dont have it in front of you but it will be available the cell phone record was retrieved that showed on betty curries cell phone calls that a call was made at 3 32 from betty currie to monica lewinsky and this confirms the testimony of monica lewinsky that the followup to get the gifts came from betty currie the only way she would know about it is if the president directed her to go retrieve the gifts as was discussed with monica earlier now the president will argue that monicas timeline does not fit with the time of the cell phone call but remember the cell phone record was retrieved subsequent to both the testimony of monica lewinsky and betty currie before the grand jury and therefore the record was not available to refresh the recollection or to make inquiry with him about that monica lewinskys time estimates as to when betty currie arrived to pick up the gifts was based upon her memory without the benefit of records the questions raised by the president on this issue are legitimate and demonstrate the need to call the key witnesses to a trial of this case and to assess which version of the events is believable and substantiated by the corroborating evidence this is certainly an area of testimony where the juror needs to hear from betty currie and monica lewinsky and to examine all of the circumstantial evidence and documentary evidence to determine the truth it is my belief based upon common sense and based upon the documentary evidence that the testimony of monica lewinsky is supported in the record and it leads to the conclusion that it was the president who initiated this retrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the evidence now there are many lawyers here in this room and you know that in federal cases all across this country judges instruct juries on circumstantial evidence we have presented to you a great amount of direct evidence grand jury testimony eyewitness testimony documentary evidence but juries can use circumstantial evidence as well and a typical line from the instruction that is given in federal courts to federal juries all across the land the law makes absolutely no distinction between the weight or value to be given either to direct or circumstantial evidence nor is a greater degree of certainty required of circumstantial evidence than of direct evidence so i think it is incumbent upon you to evaluate the circumstances very carefully in addition to the testimony now lets examine the key question for a moment why did betty currie pick up the gifts from monica lewinsky monica lewinsky states that she did not request this and the retrieval was initiated by the call from betty currie this was after the meeting with the president monica lewinskys version is corroborated by the cell phone record and the pattern of conduct on the part of betty currie what do i mean by that as a loyal secretary to the president it is inconceivable that she would go to retrieve gifts that she knows the president is very concerned about and could bring down the whole house betty currie a subordinate employee would not engage in such activity on such a sensitive matter without the approval and direction of the president himself in addition lets look further to the actions of betty currie it becomes clear that she understands the significance of these gifts their evidentiary value in a civil rights case and the fact that they are under subpoena she retrieves these items and where does she place them she hides them under her bedsignificantly a place of concealment now lets look at the presidents defense the president stated in his response to questions 24 and 25 that were submitted from the house to the president he said he was not concerned about the gifts in fact he recalled telling monica that if the jones lawyers request the gifts she should just turn them over to them the president testified he is not sure if he knew the subpoena asked for gifts now why in the world would monica and the president discuss turning over gifts to the jones lawyer if ms lewinsky had not told him that the subpoena asked for gifts on the other hand if he knew the subpoena requested gifts why would he give monica more gifts on december 28 this seems odd but ms lewinskys testimony reveals the answer she said that she never questioned that we were ever going to do anything but keep this private and that means to take whatever appropriate steps need to be taken that is from monicas grand jury testimony of august 6 why would the president even meet with monica lewinsky on december 28 when their relationship was in question and he had a deposition coming up certainly he knew hewould be questioned about it certainly if monica became a witness she would be questioned about the relationship that she would be asked when was the last time you met with the president and now they have to say december 28 if they were going to tell the truth the answer is the president knew that he had to keep monica lewinsky on the team and he was willing to take more risks so that 6he would continue to be a part of the conspiracy to obstruct the legitimate functions of the federal court in a civil rights case it should be remembered that the president has denied each and every allegation of the two articles of impeachment he has denied each element of the obstruction of justice charges including this allegation that he encouraged a scheme to conceal evidence in a civil rights case this straightforward denial illustrates the dispute in the evidence and testimony it sets the credibility of monica lewinsky the credibility of betty currie the credibility of vernon jordan and others against the credibility of the president of the united states how can you as jurors determine who is telling the truth i have pointed to the corroborating evidence the circumstantial evidence as well as common sense supporting the testimony of monica lewinsky but let me ask you two questions can you convict the president of the united states without hearing personally the testimony of one of the key witnesses the second question is can you dismiss the charges under this strong set of facts and circumstances without hearing and evaluating the credibility of key witnesses let me take this a step further and evaluate the credibility of the president lets first look back at his testimony on the december 28 meeting that he gave in his deposition in that case he seriously misrepresented the nature of his meeting with ms lewinsky and that was the gift exchange first he was asked question did she tell you that she had been served with a subpoena in this case the president answered flatly no i dont know if she had been again this is his testimony in the deposition he was also asked in the deposition if he ever talked to monica lewinsky about the possibility of her testifying his answer im not sure he said he then added that he may have joked that the jones lawyers might subpoena every woman he has ever spoken to and that i dont think we ever had more of a conversation than that about it not only does monica lewinsky directly contradict his testimony but the president later had to answer questions in the grand jury about these same set of circumstances and the president directly contradicted himself speaking of this december 28 meeting he said that he knew by then of course that she had gotten a subpoena and they had a conversation about the possibility of her testifying i submit to this body that the inconsistencies of the presidents own testimony as well as common sense seriously diminish his credibility on this issue now lets go forward once again to the time period in which the president gave his deposition in the paula jones case the president testified under oath on january 17 and immediately thereafter remember he brought betty currie in to present a set of false facts to her seeking her agreement and coaching her but the president is fully convinced that he can get by with his false denials because no one will be able to prove what did or did not happen in the oval office there were no witnesses and it boils down to a he said she said scenario and as long as that is the case he believes he can win if the president can simply destroy monica lewinskys credibility in public and before the grand jury then he will escape the consequences for his false statements under oath and obstruction in the civil rights case now remember this viewpoint though is all before the dna tests were performed on the blue dress forcing the president to acknowledge certain items in order to carry out this coverup and obstruction the president needed to go further he needed not only betty currie to repeat his false statements but also other witnesses who would assuredly be called before the federal grand jury and who would be questioned by the news media in public forums and this brings us to the false statements that the president made to his white house staff and presidential aides lets call sydney blumenthal and john podesta to the witness stand i concede they would be adverse witnesses this is referred to in exhibit 18 that you have in front of you first the testimony of sydney blumenthal mr blumenthal to put this in perspective is testifying about his conversations when the president called him in to go through these facts of what happened so mr blumenthal testified that it was at that point that he referring to the president gave his account as to what happened to me and he said that monicaand it came very fast he said monica lewinsky came at me and made a sexual demand on me he rebuffed her he said ive gone down that road before ive caused pain for a lot of people and im not going to do that again look at this next line she threatened him she said that she would tell people theyd had an affair that she was known as the stalker among her peers and that she hated it and if she had an affair or said she had an affair then she wouldnt be the stalker any more he talks about this character in a novel and i havent read that book but the last line and i said to him i said when this happened with monica lewinsky were you alone he said well i was within eyesight or earshot of someone lets go to john podestas testimony where he was called in the same fashion the president talked to him about what is happening question okay share that with us answer well i think he saidhe said thatthere was some spate of you know what sex acts were counted and he said that he had never had sex with her in any way whatsoever question okay answer that they had not had oral sex very briefly dick morris you have heard this i will refer to the last line theyre just not ready for it meaning the voters and he said well we just have to win then as the president testified before the grand jury he knew these witnesses would be called before the grand jury at page 106 of the presidents testimony before the grand juryi just want to confirm this point because it is importanthe testifiedthe question was you know that they and this is referring to john podesta sydney blumenthal and his aides that they might be witnesses you knew they might be called into the grand jury didnt you his answer thats right so there is no question these were witnesses going to testify before the grand jury he was giving them false information and he did not limit it to that the false statements to them constitute witness tampering and obstruction of justice i think there are two significant points in the statements the president made to his aides first of all the president who wants to do away with the politics of personal destruction indicates a willingness to destroy the credibility and reputation of a young person who worked in his office for what reason in order to preserve not only his presidency but more significantly to defeat the civil rights case against him it is not a matter of saying he didnt do it because he could have simply uttered a denial but he engaged in character assassination that he knew would be repeated to the federal grand jury and throughout the public she was a stalker she threatened me she came on to me and it was it was repeated secondly he makes it clear in his statements to john podesta that he denies any sexual relations with monica lewinsky including oral sex there is no quibbling about definitions in this statement it clearly reflects an attempt to deceive lie and obstruct our system of justice in this case at every turn he used whatever means available to evade the truth destroy evidence tamper with witnesses and took any other action required to prevent evidence from coming forward in a civil rights case that would prove a truth contrary to the presidents interest he had obstructed the administration of justice before the unitedstates district court in a civil rights case and before the federal grand jury but as we move toward a conclusion lets not focus just on the supporting cast we talked about but we need to look at the direct and personal actions of the president i want to look at exhibit 20 this just summarizes the seven pillars of obstruction what did the president do that constitutes evidence of obstruction no 1 he personally encouraged a witness monica lewinsky to provide false testimony no 2 the president had direct involvement in assuring a job for a witness underlining direct involvement he made the calls vernon jordan did and it is connected with the filing of the false affidavit by that witness no 3 the president personally with corrupt intentions tampered with the testimony of a prospective witness betty currie no 4 the president personally provided false statements under oath before a federal grand jury no 5 by direct and circumstantial evidence the president personally directed the concealment of evidence under subpoena in a judicial proceeding no 6 the president personally allowed false representations to be made by his attorney robert bennett to a federal district judge on january 17 no 7 the president intentionally provided false information to witnesses before a federal grand jury knowing that those statements would be repeated with the intent to obstruct the proceedings before that grand jury and that is the statements that he made to the aides the seven pillars of this obstruction case were personally constructed by the president of the united states it was done with the intent that the truth and evidence would be suppressed in a civil rights case pending against him the goal was to win and he was not going to let the judicial system stand in his way at the beginning of my presentation i tried to put this case into perspective for myself by saying that this proceeding is the same as to what takes place in every courtroom in americathe pursuit of truth seeking equal justice and upholding the law all of that is true but we know there is even more at stake in this trial what happens here affects the workings of our constitution it will affect the presidency in future decades and it will have an impact on a whole generation of americans what is at stake is our constitution and the principle of equal justice for all i have faith in the constitution of the united states but the checks and balances of the constitution are carried out by individuals individuals who are entrusted under oath with upholding the trust given to us by the people of this great land if i believe in the constitution that it will work then i must believe in you ladies and gentlemen of the senate i trust the constitution of the united states but today it is most important that i believe in you i have faith in the unitedstates senate you have earned the trust of the american people and i trust each of you to make the right decision for our country thank you mr chief justice"], [0.9999089241027832, 0.9999089241027832, 0, "i asked for this special order this evening to talk about trade we are going to be dealing with permanent normal trade relations with china here soon and there is also a privileged resolution that will be brought to the floor that i have introduced h j res 90 the discussion in the media and around the house floor has been rather clear about the permanent normal trade status but there has not been a whole lot of talk yet about whether or not we should even really be in the world trade organization i took this time mainly because i think there is a lot of misunderstanding about what free trade is there are not a whole lot of people who get up and say i am opposed to free trade and many of those who say they are for free trade quite frankly i think they have a distorted definition of what free trade really is i would like to spend some time this evening talking a little bit about that because as a strict constitutionalist and one who endorses laissezfaire capitalism i do believe in free trade and there are good reasons why countries should trade with each other the first reason i would like to mention is a moral reason there is a moral element involved in trade because when governments come in and regulate how citizens spend their money they are telling them what they can do or cannot do in a free society individuals who earn money should be allowed to spend the money the way they want so if they find that they prefer to buy a car from japan rather than detroit they basically have the moral right to spend their money as they see fit and those kinds of choices should not be made by government so there is a definite moral argument for free trade patrick henry many years ago touched on this when he said you are not to inquire how yofr trade may be increased nor how you are to become a great and powerful people but how your liberties may be secured for liberty ought to be the direct end of your government we have not heard much talk of liberty with regards to trade but we do hear a lot about enhancing ones ability to make more money overseas with trading with other nations but the argument the moral argument itself should be enough to convince one in a free society that we should never hamper or interfere with free trade when the colonies did not thrive well prior to the constitution two of the main reasons why the constitutional convention was held was one there was no unified currency that provided a great deal of difficulty in trading among the states and also trade barriers are among the states even our constitution was designed to make sure that there were not trade barriers and this was what the interstate commerce clause was all about unfortunately though in this century the interstate commerce clause has been taken and twisted around and is the excuse for regulating even trade within a state not only interstate trade but even activities within a state has nothing to do with interstate trade they use the interstate commerce clause as an excuse which is a wild distortion of the original intent of the constitution but free trade among the states having a unified currency and breaking down the barriers certainly was a great benefit for the development and the industrialization of the united states the second argument for free trade is an economic argument there is a benefit to free trade free trade means that you will not have high tariffs and barriers so you cannot buy products and you cannot exert this freedom of choice by buying outside if you have a restricted majority and you can evenly buy from within it means you are protecting industries that may not be doing a very good job and there is not enough competition it is conceded that probably it was a blessing in disguise when the automobile companies in this country were having trouble in the 1970s because the american consumer was not buying the automobiles the better automobiles were coming in and it should not have been a surprise to anybody that all of a sudden the american cars got to be much better automobiles and they were able to compete there is a tremendous economic benefit to the competition by being able to buy overseas the other economic argument is that in order to keep a product out you put on a tariff a protective tariff a tariff is a tax we should not confuse that we should not think tariff is something softer than a tax in doing something good a tariff is a tax on the consumer so those american citizens who want to buy products at lower prices are forced to be taxed if you have poor people in this country trying to niake it on their owi and they are not on welfare but they can buy clothes or shoes or an automobile or anything from overseas they are tremendously penalized by forcing them to pay higher prices by buying domestically the competition is what really encourages producers to produce better products at lower costs and keep the prices down if one believes in free trade they do not enter into free trade for the benefit of somebody else there is really no need for reciprocity free trade is beneficial because it is a moral right free trade is beneficial because there is an economic advantage to buying products at a certain price and the competition is beneficial there really are no costs in the long run free trade does not require management it is implied here on conversation on the house floor so often that free trade is equivalent to say we will turn over the management of trade to the world trade organization which serves special interests well that is not free trade that is a misunderstanding of free trade free trade meazis you can buy and sell freely without interference you do not need international management certainly if we are not going to have our own government manage our own affairs we do not want an international body to manage these international trades another thing that free trade does not imply is that this opens up the doors to subsidies free trade does not mean subsidies but inevitably as soon as we start trading with somebody we accept the notion of managed trade by the world trade organization but immediately we start giving subsidies to our competitors if our american companies and our american workers have to compete the last thing they should ever be required to do is pay some of their tax money to the government to send subsidies to their competitors and that is what is happening they are forced to subsidize their competitors on foreign aid they support their competitors overseas at the world bank they subsidize their competitors in the export import bank the overseas private investment corporation we literally encourage the exportation of jobs by providing overseas protection in insurance that cannot be bought in the private sector here a company in the united states goes overseas for cheap labor and if for political or economic reasons they go bust who bails them out it is the american taxpayer once again the people who are struggling and have to compete with the free trade it is so unfair to accept this notion that free trade is synonymous with permitting these subsidies overseas and essentially that is what is happening all the time free trade should never mean that through the management of trade that it endorses the notion of retaliation and also to stop dumping this whole idea that all of a sudden if somebody comes in with a product with a low price that you can immediately get it stopped and retaliate and this is all done in the name of free trade it could be something one endorses they might argue that they endorse this type of managed trade and subsidized trade but what is wrong and i want to make this clear what is wrong is to call it free trade because that is not free trade most individuals that i know who promote free trade around washington d c do not really either understand what free trade is or they do not really endorse it and they are very interested in the management aspect because some of the larger companies have a much bigger clout with the world trade organization than would the small farmers small rancher or small businessman because they do not have the same access to the world trade organization for instance there has been a big fight in the world trade organization with bananas the europeans are fighting with the americans over exportation of bananas well bananas are not grown in europe and they are not grown in the united states and yet that is one of the big issues of managed trade for the benefit of some owners of corporations that are overseas that make big donations to our political parties that is not coincidental so powerful international financial individuals go to the world trade organization to try to get an edge on their competitor if their competitor happens to be doing a better job and selling a little bit lower then they come immediately to the world trade organization and say oh you have to stop them that is dumping we certainly do not want to give the consumers the benefit of having a lower price so this to me is important that we try to be clear on how we define free trade and we should not do this by accepting the idea that management of trade as well as subsidizing trade and calling it free trade is just not right free trade is the ability of an individual or a corporation to buy goods and spend their money as they see fit and this provides tremendous economic benefits the third benefit of free trade which has been known for many many centuries has been the peace effect from trade it is known that countries that trade with each other and depend on each other for certain products and where the trade has been free and open and communications are free and open and travel is free and open they are very less likely to fight wars i happen to personally think this is one of the greatest benefits of free trade that it leads us to policies that direct us away from military confrontation managed trade and subsidized trade do not qualify i will mention just a little later why i think it does exactly the opposite there is a little bit more to the trade issue than just the benefits of free trade true free trade and the disadvantages of managed trade because we are dealing now when we have a vote on the normal trade status with china as well as getting out of the world trade organization we are dealing with the issue of sovereignty the constitution is very clear article i section 8 gives the congress the responsibility of dealing with international trade it does not delegate it to the president it does not delegate it to a judge it does not delegate it to an international management organization like the world trade organization international trade management is to be and trade law is to be dealt with by the unitedstates congress and yet too often the congress has been quite willing to renege on that responsibility through fasttrack legislation and deliver this authority to our president as well as delivering through agreements laws being passed and treaties delivering this authority to international bodies such as the unimfworld trade organizations where they make decisions that affect us and our national sovereignty the world trade organization has been in existence for 5 years we voted to join the world trade organization in the fall of 1994 in the lame duck session after the republicans took over the control of the house and senate but before the new members were sworn in so a lame duck session was brought up and they voted and by majority vote we joined the world trade organization which under the constitution clearly to anybody who has studied the constitution is a treaty so we have actually even invoked a treaty by majority vote this is a serious blunder in my estimation the way we have dealt with this issue and we have accepted the idea that we will remain a member based on this particular vote fortunately in 1994 there was a provision put in the bill that said that any member could bring up a privileged resolution that gives us a chance at least to say is thisa good idea to be in the world trade organization or is it not now my guess is that we do not have the majority of the unitedstates congress that thinks it is a bad idea but i am wondering about the majority of the american people and i am wondering about the number of groups now that are growing wary of the membership in the world trade organization when you look at what happenedin seattle as well as demonstrationshere in d c so there is a growing number of people from various aspects of the political spectrum who are now saying what does this membership mean to us is it good or is it bad a lot of them are coming down on the side of saying it is bad now it is also true that some who object to membership in the world trade organization happen to be conservative free enterprisers and others who object are coming from the poli tics of the left but there is agreement on both sides of this issue dealing with this aspect and it has to do with the sovereigfity issue there may be some labor law and there may be some environmental law that i would object to but i more strenuously object to the world trade organization dictating to us what our labor law ought to be and what our environmental law ought to be i highly resent the notion that the world trade organization can dictate to us tax law we are currently under review and the world trade organization has ruled against the united states because we have given a tax break to our overseas company and they have ruled against us and said that this tax break is a tax subsidy language which annoys me to no end they have given us until october 1 to get rid of that tax break for our corporations so they are telling us the unitedstates congress what we have to do with tax law you say oh that cannot be we do not have to do what they tell us well technically we do not have to but we will not be a very good member and this is what we agreed to in the illegal agreement certainly it was not a legitimate treaty that we signed but in this agreement we have come up and said that we would obey what the wto says our agreement says very clearly that any ruling by the wto the congress is obligated to change the law this is the interpretation and this is what we signed this is a serious challenge and we should not accept so easily this idea that we will just go one step further this has not just happened 5 years ago there has been a gradual erosion of the concept of national sovereignty it occurred certainly after world war 11 with the introduction of the united nations and now under current conditions we do not even ask the congress to declare war yet we still fight a lot of wars we send troops all over the world and we are involved in combat all the time and our presidents tell us they get the authority from a un resolution so we have gradually lost the concept of national sovereignty iwant to use a quote from somebody that i consider rather typical of the establishment we talk about the establishment but nobody ever knows exactly who they are but i will name this individual who i think is pretty typical of the establishment and that is walter cronkite he says we need not only an executive to make international law but we need the military forces to enforce that law and the judicial system to bring the criminals to justice in an international government but he goes on to say and this he makes very clear and this is what we should be aware of the american people are going to begin to realize that perhaps they are going to have to yield some sovereignty to an international body to enforce world law and i think that is going to come to other people as well so it is not like it has been hidden it is not like it is a secret it is something that those who disagree with me about liberty and the constitution they believe in internationalism and the world trade organization and the united nations and they certainly have the right to that belief but it contradicts everything america stands for and it contradicts our constitution so therefore we should not allow this to go unchallenged now the whole idea that treaties could be passed and undermine the ability of our congress to pass legislation or undermine our constitution this was thought about and talked about by the founders of this country they were rather clear on the idea that a treaty although the treaty can become the law of the land a treaty could never be an acceptable law of the land if it amended or changed the constitution that would be ridiculous and they made that very clear it could have the effect of the law of the land as long as it was a legitimate constitutional agreement that we entered into but thomas jefferson said if the treaty power is unlimited then we do not have a constitution surely the president and the senate cannot do by treaty what the whole government is interdicted from doing in any way so that is very important we cannot just sit back and accept the idea that the world trade organization we have entered into it it was not a treaty it was an agreement but we have entered into it and the agreement says we have to do what they tell us even if it contradicts the whole notion that it is the congress and peoples responsibility to pass their own laws with regard to the environment with regard to labor and with regard to tax law so i think this is important material i think this is an important subject a lot more important than just the vote to trade with china i think we should trade with china i think we should trade with cuba i think we should trade with everybody possible unless we are at war with them i do not think we should have sanctions against iran iraq or libya and it does not make much sense to me to be struggling and fighting and giving more foreign aid to a country like china and at the same time we have sanctions on and refuse to trade and talk with cuba that does not make a whole lot of sense yet those who believe and promote trade with china are the ones who will be strongly objecting to trade with cuba and these other countries so i think a little bit more consistency on this might be better for all of us alexander hamilton also talked about this he said a treaty cannot be made which alters the constitution of the country or which infringes any expressed exception to the powers of the constitution of the united states so these were the founders talking about this and yet we have drifted a long way it does not happen overnight it has been over a 50year period five years ago we went one step further first we accepted the idea that international finance would be regulated by the imf then we accepted the idea that the world bank which was supposed to help the poor people of the world and redistribute wealth they have redistributed a lot of wealth but most of it ended up in the hands of wealthy individuals and wealthy politicians but the poor people of the world never get helped by these programs now 5 years ago we have accepted the notion that the world trade organization will bring about order in trade around the country well since that time we have had a peso crisis in mexico and we had a crisis with currencies in southeast asia so i would say that the management of finances with the imf as well as the world trade organization has been very unsuccessful and even if one does not accept my constitutional argument that we should not be doing this we should at least consider the fact that what we are doing is not very successful what i think we are seeing when you get tens of thousands of people out on an issue that seems to be esoteric and start talking and demonstrating against our policy essentially as they did in seattle and washington i would say maybe the grassroots in america are starting to wake up a lot sooner than the people here in the unitedstates congress so i think that it is very important that we think this through and think of it in the big context not only in the very narrow context of voting for trade with china or not the world trade organization does not represent free trade because it is management of trade it accepts all the complaints from the countries who think that they are being undersold or the competition is getting a little tough for them just this week the president has announced that he will send seven more complaints to the world trade organization seven different countries who are being charged with unfair trade pradtices the united states has not fared well with the world trade organization the world trade organization has ruled against us on patents dealing with the playing of music the world trade organization has ruled against us with regard to taxes and also against us on some antidumping resolutions but i am afraid that what is happening is it is just another international bureaucracy that will be able to provide benefits for some very powerful special interests and ignore the little people who have a harder time to get an ear at the world trade organization the china situation i think is an interesting one because we are spending a lot of effort trading with china of course the tragedy really here is not free trade in trading with china it has to do with china getting some of our top secrets which to me is more disturbing than trading and buying some things that we might want from china but china we have gone to this extent they have received a tremendous amount i think they have now received 13 billion from the world bank they are the largest recipient of the exportimport bank and at the same time we send these benefits to china we still have members in the congress who seem to flip flop on the issues who will say well no i do not like china i think china they are not respectable enough and they will undermine what we are doing so i do not want to trade with china and they will vote against trade with china yet at the same time they continue to vote to subsidize china through the exportimport bank that is hard for me to understand why if one does not want to trade with china why would one want to continue to send them money why would they not vote against the world bank sending them money why would they not vote against the exportimport bank sending money over there because that is subsidizing them that is where the real harm comes from yet we see that inconsistency all the time i would like to discuss the third point about free trade that i made and that is that free trade should lead to peace i sincerely believe this if we have free trade but take an example of this free trade is supposed to lead to lower taxes and lower prices but here we have the world trade organization not telling us to lower taxes to be equal that would not be quite as harmful but here we have a world trade organization telling us to raise taxes to equal the competition so it is working perversely the same way in the military sense we trade with china we subsidize china and yet china appears to be a threat to taiwan so what do we do do we say let us not send any more subsidies to china no what we do is we hurry up and say well there could be a conflict between taiwan and china so we send more weapons to taiwan so in subsidizing the communist system in china as well as militarizing and sending the military weapons and promising that we will support taiwan we are bound and determined to stir up a fight over there with us in the middle so this in itself should tell us that this is not free trade free trade means that we are less likely to fight with people and yet we are stirring up trouble over there and literally but rather typically we are subsidizing and helping both sides which we have done for many many years this is why the argument for national sovereignty and the national defense a strong national defense makes a whole lot of sense because we do not have to make these determinations first we do not have the authority to make the determination of the internal affairs of other nations we do not have that authority we probably do not have the wisdom to pick out who the good guys and the bad guys are but we certainly do nothave the finesse to do it by going in there and satisfying all sides about all we do is we commit ourselves to these conflicts around the world commit our troops and commit our dollars instead of trying to come back from some of these commitments of troops every place in the world we are looking for more dragons to slay we in the congress are going along with the president getting prepared to send billions of dollars down to colombia to support a faction down there that has been in a civil war for decades and 30 000 people killed and of course the grandiose explanation is that we are going down there and we are going to stop drugs from coming in here which is a dream because that is not going to happen but the real reason why i think we venture out into these areas is to serve the financial interests because it just happens that those individuals who like to sell helicopters and they like to sell airplanes and they like others who would like to protect oil interests are the ones who are more likely to lobby for us to be in areas like this free trade if it were true free trade we would be less likely ever to fight with other countries there was one free trade economist who stated that he had a rule it was called the mcdonald rule he said he has watched it so far and up until now the best he knows there has never been two countries that have had mcdonalds in each country ever fought a war so that is rather simplistic but i think there is a lot of truth to that that we should trade and talk with people give people the freedom and the right to spend their money the way they want do not take the money from the people who may have shortterm disadvantages from free trade and tax them in order to subsidize the competition that is where i think we really get off track and we do way too much of it i would like to touch on another subject about trade that is rarely mentioned and it may well be one of the most important aspects of trade that has to do with the even flow of trade between countries and their currencies balance of payment deficits and current account deficits are very very important in the long run especially if they are accompanied by fiat money and not sound money and different currencies being inflated at different rates this will cause imbalances which causes tremendous shakeouts like we had in southeast asia where all of a sudden there are devaluations and some of the protectionist sentiment in order to get an edge on the competitors will be frequently deliberate devaluations where they will prop up currencies in order to get an edge or keep a currency lower in order to get an edge these things can work for a while but they usually end up in a crisis with a currency crisis higher interest rates inflations and a downturn in the economy now fortunately over the last 10 years most other countries have done a poorer job than we have the united states has had a builtin advantage in the 1990s since the breakup of the soviet union we have remained the power house economically and militarily which conveys a certain amount of confidence to our currency and has given us license to counterfeit it has given our federal reserve license to create credit out of thin air for all of the reasons they want to do to stimulate housing or whatever also to encourage some of these trade imbalances so some of the protectionists will look and they will say look how much we buy from china look how much we buy from japan that is related to the fact that we have a currency that is artificially and temporarily rated very high and foreigners are willing to take our money creating this imbalance but that will all come to an end because we cannot do this forever when that happens stocks go down interest rates go up the economy drops and inflation comes back the benefits that we have received over these past 10 years have only been temporary so when we look at the imbalances created by the currency system and the monetary system we should be prepared to find out that the world trade organization will do absolutely nothing to solve that problem the imf cannot solve that problem the world bank cannot solve that problem and the world trade organization certainly will not solve that problem because some of the imbalances have already been built into the system we are the greatest debtor nation in the world today our current account deficit is running at record highs that will be reversed and the value of the dollar will be reversed this will cause some serious problems for all of us it will be the paying back we have borrowed money endlessly the foreigners are willing to take our money sell us cheap products our standard of living goes up they loan us back the money they buy into our stock market so we have an illusion of wealth because we have the greatest counterfeiting machine in the world and that is the federal reserves ability to create credit out ofthin air it would be nice if it would last forever and these perceptions would persist but if one looks at monetary history one finds out that it never persists forever it persists only for a limited period of time there was a time in the 1980s they thought in japan it would persist forever and then all of a sudden the investment and the adjustments that were required from the overcapacity built into their system came about and because they have not permitted the liquidation of the debt and the adjustment in prices and wages their problems have persisted now for more than 10 years so we will have to face up to that the important thing there is that it is not a trade problem it is a currency problem one day we in the congress will have to decide whether or not we want a sound currency again or whether we want to continue manipulating a paper currency a paper currency backed up by nothing nothing but promises promises that we will tax the american people and that if the american people are not working hard enough and they are not paying enough taxes or the economy slips all of a sudden that perceived value of the dollar will go down so that is a very serious problem that we will be needing to address in the not too distant future i would like to mention in a little bit more detail the h j res 90 because that is the number of the resolution"],

health care the republicans and frankly some conservative democrats are saying wait a minute wait a minute before we jump into this pool of nationalized medicine what you tried to do with hillary clinton about 6 or 7 years ago 7 or 8 years ago lets take a look at what the ramifications are lets study other nations that have jumped into the same pool that you want us to jump into for example canada and take a look at what the canadian system has that is better than our system that is what i propose you do before you jump into the pool take a look at what the unintended consequences are maybe there are some things in the canadian health care system that are better than the american health care system but i would tell you this that in america you still get the best health care of anywhere in the world when they like to come up here and talk about the uninsured americans remember that there are different categories you may have somebody that is uninsured but no matter where you are in america you can never be denied emergency care at a hospital if that hospital receives government funds and i do not know any hospital i am sure there are a couple of them out there but not very many more that do not operate on government funds the fact is the prescription drugs in this country the prices that are being charged for them are in my opinion outrageous there is no question that the angel here is not the pharmaceutical companies but let me tell you there is also something to be said about the research that these pharmaceutical companies ought to be doing so that we have better medicines you take a look at the kind of medicines we have today just in the last few years i can remember 3 years ago when you got diarrhea you drank that junk that pink junk you drank it you drank a whole thing of it to try to get rid of the diarrhea today you buy a little packet about this big with little pills you pop one pill and that is it our country is the country that makes advancements we have got to do something about these outrageous prices that have snuck in here for example i do not know why the democrat from new jersey instead of up here bashing and misleading all of you by saying that the republicans the leadership have planned this cruel hoax on the americans really honestly is there anybody you have ever met in elective office that wants to go out and play a cruel hoax on the constituents they represent is that an exaggeration of course it is an exaggeration but the fact that we come back to is this what do we do to bring the pharmaceutical prices into line without bringing in nationalized health care the democrats are very easy to stand up here in front of you ladies and gentlemen and stand in front of my colleagues and promise you the moon the magic cure greener fields on the other side of the fence all i am saying is before you jump on the other side of the fence take a look at the consequences of the plan that they are proposing where do you think al gore the vice president is going to get his money from this it comes out of that surplus remember this is the first time in 30 years we have had that surplus as i say clearly there is a problem out there we need to address that problem but the gore approach and the democratic congress approach or at least the liberal side of it i have got to say i have got to restrain myself because we have several conservative democrats who do not agree with the liberal approach as just espoused by the gentleman from new jersey but the liberal democratic approach is the hillary clinton approach nationalized health care socialized health care i can tell a lot of you right now 64 percent of the people in america as i understand have some kind of prescription care service you better figure out what the gentleman from new jersey is proposing to do with the service of those of you that have prescription care in moving that to the people that do not have prescription care service there are lots of consequences to what the democrats the liberal democrats are proposing when they offer you something for nothing there is a price to be paid and i think it is incumbent upon the gentleman from new jersey and his colleagues when they stand up here and trash and cut down more conservative democrats or the conservative republicans i think it is incumbent on them to kind of have an openness requirement tell the people what the consequences are of nationalized health care tell people what the consequences are of a canadiantype of system talk about it tell the people what the consequences are of research for better medicines know this is why this congress just does not jump up and sign the blank check offered by the gentleman fromnew jersey we are not going to jump up and sign a blank check at least enough of us on both sides of the aisle are saying wait a minute what are we doing what are the consequences clearly we all agree on the problem despite what the gentleman from new jersey says nobody is patting the pharmaceutical companies on the back and saying be proud of yourself they have not done a good job in some regards with medicine but frankly it appears that there is some gouging going on out there but before my colleagues addressthat problem take a very careful look at what the democrat the liberal democrat approach is because i can assure my colleagues in the long run first of all they promise it will only be 10 percent of the surplus and a much much smaller percent of the budget and nothing will grow and grow and grow and it is the open door for socialized medicine in this country for a national health care and there are a lot of people who in my opinion will suffer under a national health care plan nobody should be forgotten and nobody should be left behind but there are ways to address that without going into a hillary clintontype of health care plan so my discussion here tonight was not intended to be on health care but there is nobody else that stands here to rebut these gentlemen as they speak here unrebutted for 1 hour about the socalled quote cruel hoaxes by the republican leadership those words ought to be stricken from the record they are inaccurate they are misleading the gentleman from new jersey and some of his colleagues they know that the cruel hoax by the leadership i did not say there is a cruel hoax by the democratic leadership come on we have more protocol on this floor we can be more ladies and gentlemen in talking about the problem the people that suffer while this partisan bickering goes on back here are the senior citizens that do not have prescription care or by the way anybody that does not have the ability to care for themselves but do not address it by waving the magic wand and saying look citizens we have got something for nothing we are going to take care of all of your health care needs we are going to take away your personal responsibility and the government is going to assume it remember every time and i cannot say this strong enough every time the government assumes one of your responsibilities every time the government takes a burden of yours and makes it a burden of theirs they take something with it it comes with a price somewhere we are losing a freedom somewhere we are going to lose the ability to have choice in the future so in summary on this health care plan let me say i am discouraged by the comments that were made previous to my speaking here this evening we do not get anywhere and i direct my remarks at the liberal democrats look we are not going to get anywhere with a nationalized health care plan we are not going to get anywhere with socialized medicine why do you not sit down instead of talking about how leadership has this cruel conspiracy going on by throwing a few bucks at insurance companies why do you not put the electionyear rhetoric aside and sit down with us and help us try and figure out what a solution is every day that we use that kind of rhetoric there are people out there who are suffering because my colleagues are not willing to sit down and put their heads together to come up with a solution and there is a solution i am optimistic that we can have a solution we do have a great country and we have made wonderful strides in health care but clearly we have got some problems in that system but we can fix it without having our health care provided by the united states of america which means they are going to oversee what doctors you see they are going to oversee what kind of prescriptions you get they are going to oversee what kind of treatments you get they are going to oversee how often you are going to get to see this doctor or that doctor socialized or national medicine is not the magic answer it appears to be tonight it is very easy to buy into this very easy to buy into this because the democrats the liberal side over here not all democrats i stand corrected the liberal democrats over here they think you are going to get something for nothing and they are saying look it is easy for us to afford it no problem remember you do not get something for nothing let me switch subjects and talk about something much much more pertinent i think really because of the olympics i hope some of you have are having the opportunity to watch it in fact i was over at the office before i came over this evening watching the olympics how exciting that is even if it is taped nbc or whoever does that the reality of it is look what we get to see clear across the ocean in sydney and watch those olympics and i am very proud of those people i want to tell you i heard an advertisement i will not tell you the name of the company the other day but i heard an advertisement about the olympics and it said our young men and women that go over there to compete in the olympics they will come home heroes and i thought to myself you know they will come over celebrities i would like to have their autographs i am proud of them but i think using the word heroes is somewhat of a delusion i think the real word of heroes is used in a different type of setting there are sports celebrities and there are heroes i have a perfect example i am not just up here talking without giving you an example it is happening this week in pueblo colorado first of all on my way over i real quickly grabbed a dictionary and i looked up the word hero hero a mythological or a legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability an illustrious warrior a man admired for his noble qualities one that shows great courage an object of extreme admiration and devotion with courage with that said let me read an editorial from one of the leading newspapers in the state of colorado the pueblo chieftain it is called patriots week what is patriots week about this is a celebration of heroes this week we anticipate more than 110 americans more than 110 americans who have been decorated with the medal of honor which is the highest honor our country can give out 110 bf them will be in pueblo colorado to be honored by a city which was recently designated as one of the four finest communities to live in this country pueblo colorado picked out of hundreds of communities it was picked in the top four this week pueblo is hosting 110 medal of honor winners and they are calling their week patriots week i am going to go through my poster here in a few minutes with you and show you some of the interesting things about what this week is going to consist of first of all let me read the editorial out of the sunday chieftain star and journal my good friend bob rawlings who is the publisher and editor this is patriots week the home of heroes in pueblo colorado on tuesday the national medal of honor society convenes here for its annual convention pueblo is home to four medal of honor recipients the most of any city at least in modern times on thursday largerthanlife bronze sculptures of the four puebloans who won this will be unveiled at the pueblo convention center they are carl sitter william crawford drew dix and jerry murphy mr sitter and mr crawford died this year but not before they got to see their sculptures taking form also included is a display of all medal of honor recipients dating back to the civil war when the nations highest honor was approved by the united states congress a black tie patriot dinner on friday will bring five greats from the world of sports to pueblo golfer arnold palmer gold glove baseball player brooks robinson nba center david the admiral robinson onetime boxing champion gene fullmer and the nhl hockey star pat lafontaine will receive the societys patriot award for the joy and support they have given to our military forces also commentator paul harvey and world war ii cartoonist bill maudlin will receive special awards from the medal of honor society two other veterans organizations are in pueblo this in week in conjunction with the societys convention two days ago the 50th anniversary reunion of the 578th combat engineering battalion began later this year the crew of the peachy a b29 piloted by puebloan bill haver that flew raids over japan will meet for its annual gettogether mr haver named the plane a replica of which is at the aircraft museum at the memorial airport in honor of his sister peachy wilcoxson and i know peachy today is constitution day all of these patriots spot for the ideals embodied in the united states constitution and many of their comrades perished in that effort so let each and every one of us reflect on that remarkable document and rededicate ourselves to the cause of liberty and justice well how exciting in pueblo alone for example i would like to just to kind of for a moment go over who are the four members who are from pueblo colorado as i mentioned in my comments unfortunately two of our members two of our citizens of pueblo passed away earlier this year mr crawford who was in the army you can see right here and mr sitter right here but we still have surviving drew dix the gentleman right here with the red dot and jerry murphy who was in the marines in korea this is the plaza that pueblo colorado has dedicated and put together through contributions from the local community here is a community that came together did not come to the united states congress and ask for money did not expect the government to do it they got together in their community of pueblo colorado to honor all medal of honor recipients but specifically to put something that will be a longlasting recognition of the four medal of honor winners from pueblo colorado that is what that little plaza is going to look like the statues here is one of jerry murphy 82 feet tall that is the completed statute there honoring jerry here so you have an idea there is bill crawford before he passed away as he stands with the statue of him which is also about 81 2 feet high this is going to be an exciting week in pueblo what i thought i would do is share with my colleagues four of the stories of these medal of honor winners i can tell you that i have had the occasion and i consider it amongst the highest privileges of my congressional career if i were to kind of recapture my memories of serving in the united states congress where i felt the most fortunate to meet somebody or the most privileged to be able to shake their hand i would have to put it in the order of i am catholic the pope and mother theresa and right behind them our medal of honor winners in fact i was in a parade in pueblo not very long ago and i had the opportunity in that parade to shake the hands of two medal of honor winners who were watching the parade you feel so much pride because these people are such heroes they really are what heros are the word they do not cause any delusion to the word hero h7715 they embody hero in its fullest envisions let me talk about drew dix i will point out drew here drew right here by the way a special hello to his mother a very sweet person in pueblo colorado let me talk a little about drew drew d dix unitedstates army special forces vietnam citation for conspicuous gallantry in the action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty sergeant dix distinguished himself by exceptional heroism by serving as a unit advisor to heavily armed vietcong battalions attacked the providence capital of chau phu resulting in complete breakdown and fragmentation of defenses of the city sergeant dix with a patrol of vietnamese soldiers was recalled to assist in the defense of the city learning that a nurse was trapped in a house near the center of the city sergeant dix organized a relief force successfully rescued the nurse and returned her safely to the tackle operations ceiter but that is not all being informed that now there were other trapped civilians within the city sergeant dix voluntarily led another force to rescue eight civilian employees located in a building which was under heavy mortar and small arms fire sergeant dix then returned to the center of the city upon approaching a building he was subjected to intense automatic rifle and machine gun fire from an unknown number of vietcong he personally assaulted the building killing six of the vietcong and rescuing two philippinos the following day sergeant dix still onhis own volition assembled a 20man force and though under intense enemy fire cleared the vietcong out of the hotel the theater and other adjacent buildings within the city during this portion of the attack army republic of vietnam soldiers inspired by the heroism and success of sergeant dix rallied and commenced firing upon the viet cong sergeant dix individually captured 20 prisoners including a high ranking viet cong official he then attacked enemy troops who had entered the residence of the deputy providence chief and was successful in rescuing the officials wife and children sergeant dixs personal heroic actions resulted in 14 confirmed viet cong killed in action and possibly 25 more the capture of 20 prisoners 15 weapons and the rescue of 14 united states and free world civilians the heroism of sergeant dix was in the highest tradition and reflects great credit upon the united states army raymond jerry murphy and if you ever go to pueblo colorado you will see murphy boulevard i mean these guys are real heroes their community loves them our country has deep respect for medal of honor winners excuse me not winners they did not win it medal of honor recipients and i stand corrected on that raymond jerry murphy united states marine corps korea citation for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as a platoon commander of company a an action against enemy aggressor forces although painfully wounded by fragments froman enemy mortar shell while leading his evacuation platoon in support of assault units attacking a cleverly concealed and wellentrenched hostile force occupying commanding ground second lieutenant murphy steadfastly refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small arms fire skillfully maneuvering his force from one position to the next and shouting words of encouragement undeterred by the increasing intense enemy fire he immediately located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire swept hill to direct evacuation teams to the wounded personally carrying many of the stricken marines to safety when reinforcements were needed by the assaulting elements second lieutenant murphy employed part of his unit as support and during the ensuing battle personally killed two of the enemy with his own pistol with all of the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units beginning to disengage he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of friendly forces of the hill and although suffering intense pain from his previous wounds he seized an automatic rifle to provide more firepower when the enemy reappeared from the trenches after reaching the base of the hill he organized a search party and again ascended the slope for a final check on missing marines locating and carrying the bodies of machine gun crew back down the hill wounded a second time while conducting the entire force to the line of departure through a continuing barrage of enemy small arms artillery and mortar fire he again refused medical assistance until assured that every one of his men including all of the casualties had preceded him to the main lines his resolute and inspiring leadership and exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon second lieutenant murphy and enhance the finest traditions of the united states marine corps william crawford our third pueblo citizen united states army world war ii for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of life and above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy in italy 13 september 1943 whencompany i attacked an enemyheld position on hill 424 the third platoon in which private crawford was a squad scout attacked as a base platoon for the company after reaching the crest of the hill the platoon was pinned down by intense enemy machine and small arms fire locating one of these guns which was dug in on a terrace on his immediate front private crawford without orders and on his own initiative moved over the hill under enemy fire to a point within a few yards of the machine gun emplacement and singlehandedly destroyed the machine gun and killed three of the crew with a hand grenade thus enabling his platoon to continue its advance when the platoon after reaching the crest was once more delayed by enemy fire private crawford again in face of intense fire and on his own volition advanced directly to the front midway between two hostile two this time hostile machine gun nests located on a higher terrace and placed in a small ravine moving first to the left with a hand grenade he destroyed one gun emplacement and killed the crew then he worked his way to the right and under continuous fire from the other machine gun emplacement he used one hand grenade and the use of his rifle and he killed one enemy and blew out the machine gun nest and forced the remainder of the enemy to flee seizing the enemy machine gun that was left from the one emplacement he fired on the withdrawing germans and facilitating his companys advance these are remarkable individuals carl sitter united states marine corps korea for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as a commanding officer of company g in action against enemy aggressor forces ordered to break through enemy infested territory to reinforce his battalion the morning of 29 november captain sitter continuously exposed himself to enemy fire as he led his company forward and despite 25 percent casualties suffered in the furious action he succeeded in driving the group to its objective assuming the responsibility of attempting to seize and occupy a strategic area occupied by a hostile force of regiment strength deeply entrenched on a snow covered hill commanding the entire valley southeast of town as well as the line of march of friendly troops withdrawing to the south he reorganized his depleted units the following morning and boldly led them up that steep frozen hillside under blistering fire encouraging and redeploying his troops as casualties occurred and directing forward platoons as they continued the drive to the top of the ridge during the night when the vastly outnumbered enemy launched a sudden vicious counterattack setting the hill ablaze with mortar machinegun and automatic weapons fire and taking a heavy toll in troops captain sitter visited each foxhole and gun position coolly deploying and integrating reinforcing units consisting of service personnel unfamiliar with infantry tactics into a coordinated combat team and instilling in every man the will and determination to hold his position at all costs with the enemy penetrating his lines in repeated counterattacks which often required handtohand combat and on one occasion infiltrating to the command post with hand grenades he fought gallantly with his men in repulsing and killing the fanatic attackers in each encounter painfully wounded in the face wounded in the arms and wounded in the chest by bursting grenades he staunchly refused to be evacuated and he continued to fight on until a successful defense of the area was assured with a loss of the enemy by more than 50 percent of their troops dead or wounded or captured his valiant leadership superb tactics and great personal valor throughout 36 hours of bitter combat reflect the highest credit upon captain sitter and the unitedstates naval service these four gentlemen that i just described as heroes who got the medal of honor are from pueblo colorado but i want to remind all of my colleagues there is what we call the medal of honor society and 110 members of that society will be in pueblo colorado this week to be honored by our community and to be honored by our nation for what they have done those four stories i told are but a drop in the bucket of the stories of valor the stories of courageous brave men and women who stepped out above the call of duty because they believed in america they believed in freedom and they were willing to lay their life down for it this weekend i had a wonderful opportunity to spend with my wife and my parents in meeker colorado and we were up at the cemetery an old cemetery we were in the old section of the cemetery and i walked by a grave and it was a young man not much on the gravestone had the gentlemens name had his birth he was 22 years old and all it said on the gravestone was he died for his country as we know we have thousands and thousands and thousands of men and women in this country who have died for their country and we have hundreds of thousands of men and women who have fought bravely for what this country stands for for the freedom of this country for the benefit of all of us we cannot acknowledge everybody with a medal of honor so we know that there are brave and courageous individuals out there who should have received the medal of honor who earned the medal of honor but did not receive it but we do know we still have a group of individuals who did receive the medal of honor and they truly should own lock stock and barrel the
