gentleman for yielding i thank the gentleman for organizing this special order this evening on this very very important subject as we enter into the debate on a social issue that will impact the lives of every american every man woman and child in this country what could be more important than taking time to discuss the pros and cons i was delighted as i am sure my colleagues were today to see that the bipartisan negotiations that have been going on for weeks now many many hours in length were rewarded were fruitful in coming out and announcing today a bipartisan health care proposal so we really have a debate now we have a clintongephardt we have a clintonmitchell bill and we have a health care reform bill with bipartisan support that deals with the health care crisis in this country from the standpoint of private sector reforms to expand coverage to more americans than ever before and to begin to control the spiraling costs in health care i think there are a number of things out there in the public sector right now to assist us as we look at this health care debate one of the books recently published written by dr jane orient she is an internist in tucson arizona and she heads the association of american physicians and surgeons with over 4 000 members nationwide the title of her book is a very timely book indeed your doctor is not in i think she provides us some important insights let me share a few of them she says first of all the proposed remedies for the health care crisis are snake oil and you shouldnt swallow them further the private doctor is an endangered species in the end we will have a herd a nice placid socialized tamed cudchewing herd readers should care about the plight of doctors for one and only one reasons some day they might need one you may think you know what the hippocratic oath says but you probably dont and you should learn about it before they do away with it entirely the hippocratic oath is built on physician autonomy it reads i will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment eurther do you want your doctor to place society or the department of health and human services ahead of his being independent she says further managed care is about preventing medical care in order to make money for thirdparty payers or to save money for the government behind the slick advertising managed care is little more than prepayment for rationed health care rationed care is one of the most disastrous things that can ever happen to the health care practice in this country then i conclude with her insight there is no utopia i will only maintain that a free market in medicine is the best of the avallfble alternatives and the one that does the least harm that is what doctors do the least harm that is what the hippocratic oath says the way we do the least harm although it is not perfect is to maintain a free market in the health care system another recent book a novel published entitled fatal cure by robin cook a bestselling novelist he as a physician as a doctor imagines what will happen to the health care service industry in this country should we resort should we go in these coming weeks to governmentrun health care system i only share with the listeners this evening and with my colleagues a couple of paragraphs of the dialog that he imagines might take place some day he says everyone knows that doctor patient relationships are the cornerstone of medical care one of the characters says maybe thats passe the current reality is determined by a new army of medical bureaucrats being created by government intervention all of a sudden economics and politics have reached the ascendancy in the medical arena i am afraid the major concern is the bottom line on the balance sheet not patient care the problem is washington every time the government gets seriously involved in medical care they seem to screw things up they try to please everybody and end up pleasing no one dr cook is absolutely right that would be the result of governmentrun health care in the washington post not exactly an advocate of freeenterprise health care certainly one that has espoused the governmentrun health care in its editorial policies dana priest in a frontpage story entitled health bill may have no substitute for bureaucracy he writes just recently president clinton and members of congress last week hailed the senate democratic leaderships health bill as a vast improvement over the bureaucracyladen 1 462page plan produced by the white house but the 1 410page bill proposed by senate majority leader george j mrrchell dmaine also would create dozens of new federal and state agencies they would have untested authority to centralize reorganize monitor and enforce the way medical care is bought sold and to a lesser extent practiced in this country and indeed the post is right they would have untested authority to centralize reorganize monitor and enforce i understand that the clintonmitchell bill in the senate has over 20 new federal bureaucracies that will be created now before i yield back to the gentleman i want to share a letteri am from the state of arkansas i have served 8 years in the arkansas legislature with nowpresident clinton our president was then my governor our chief executive in the state of arkansas many times during those 12 years that he was our governor the issue of abortion and more specifically the issue of public funding of abortion arose in various debates in arkansas as it has been throughout our country a major issue and it continues to be a major bone of contention and a major issue in the health care debate in every major governmentrun health care plan that has been presented to this congress the provision for reproductive services or abortion services if you will has been included that means that every american under a governmentrun health care system would be subsidizing the practice of abortion regardless of what their moral conscience or religious convictions would be september 26 1986 governor clinton then governor wrote in a letter to the arkansas righttolife people a letter in which he said in part because many of the questions do concern the issue of abortion i would like for your members to be informed of my position on the states responsibility in that area i am opposed to abortion and to government funding of abortions we should not spend state funds on abortions because so many people believe abortion is wrong that was governor clinton who is now president of the united states saying he not only opposed abortion but he opposed public funding of abortion and believed it was wrong to require people who believe it is wrong to pay for abortions and yet today he has included that insisted on including that in every governmentrun health care program that he has advocated and supported then i would concludeand i am indebted to our colleague from the other side of the aisle the gentleman from minnesota tim penny democrat for his dear colleague letter in which he points out something that i think is vital in this debate in the coming weeks he points out that major votes of the 20th century on large social policy changes have always been accorded overwhelming bipartisan support he enumerates some of those the social security act of 1935 96 percent of the democrats supported that 81 percent of the republicans supported that and it passed by a vote of 372 to 33 the development of the interstate highway system federalaid highway act of 1956 major policy change in our country 93 percent of the democrats supported it 98 percent of the republicans supported it passed by a vote of 388 to now the civil rights act of 1964 what more significant social change has this congress enacted than the civil rights act of 1964 sixtyone percent of the democrats supported the civil rights bill 80 percent of the republicans supported the civil rights act and it passed by a vote of 290 to i could go on the clean air act the medicare act the water pollution act all of these passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities here we are told that we must in the coming weeks have a health care reform bill that is going to affect the lives of every american the biggest social change in 50years and we are going to do it with the barest of majorities it is going to be forced through in spite of overwhelming opposition not only by the republican party but the polls indicate by the american people when the buscapade came to town i saw the big banners on the side saying pass it now and i said to myself pass what now at that point we did not even have a bill no one had read a bill yet they say we have got to hurry it through we have got to do it now yet the polls say 65 percent of the american people say they want to wait they want to read it want to study it want to react to it and that is the way major social change ought to take place it ought to take place with the american people aware of it the american people supportive of it and with a large bipartisan majority supporting it in congress we do not have that and that is~why we ought to wait

we have gone in the last several congresses toward adopting mussolini rules in the house of representatives mussolini rules are those that follow the handbook of benito mussolini who wanted to make the trains run on time but resorted to fascism to do that mussolini rules in the house are those that want to make the house run on time but destroy democracy in order to do it let us see here during the 95th congress just a few short years ago about 85 percent of all the rules were open rules in other words allowed free and open debate allowed middleclass america to have their views heard on the house floor guess what as middleclass america has become more and more disgusted with the congress and has found what congress is doing undermining everything they believe in open rules have declined to tho point that in this congress they have plunged to nothing today we have another mussolini rule on the floor that gives us no chance for open debate whatsoever what has happened about closed rules as middle america has found that congress is not doing what they wish congress has more and more resorted to closed rules until we get to this congress when every rule brought to the floor is a closed rule what does that tell us it tells us that the american people are being shut out of this body it tels us that the democrats majority can no longer allow the american people to have their say i suggested that this was going to become a part of a pattern here in a colloquy a few minutes ago and i was told that no such thing was said in the rules committee about this becoming a pattern now i am not allowed to quote from the transcript of the rules committee but i can paraphrase it and everything that i said was absolutely true in that colloquy between the gentlewoman from new york and the gentleman from south carolina in which they talked about the fact that the only amendments that should be allowed on the floor under anything other than emergency conditions should be those that come up in the committee well what does that mean it means that we are not going to have a chance for members of congress representing 565 000 of their constituents to have their opportunity to offer amendments on the floor that means that middle class america is being shut out of the house floor and it is being done purposely and the rules committee has every intention of continuing the pattern the gentlewoman from new york referred to the fact that there was a long debate over the department of education some years ago and it went on for some days and what they do not tell you about that debatewhat they do not tell you about that debate that she refers tois the fact that they checked with their former republican colleague mr horton about this and mr horton was a proponent of the department of education he did not like that long debate and i will tell members why because when they went into that debate they had a 100vote margin and they were going to win the thing by 100 votes after the debate and after that bill was defined for the american people they only won by four votes because the debate did change minds the fact is that that is what often takes place when you allow free debate on the house floor when middleclass america has their opportunity to be heard on the house floor every once in a while minds are changed every once in a while we move ahead the democrats know that if we are able to expose their legislation and their programs to the light of day that middleclass america will not agree with them and they will have a chance we will have a chance of reversing some of that legislation on the floor they do not want that to happen and so the trend is clear mussolini rules are winning more and more of the open rules are being declined and mussolini rules are going up so in this congress mussolini wins we have gone from having jeffersons manual to having mussolinis manual governing the house of representatives"], [0.08031361550092697,

of maryland in reporting on our delegation mission to mexico the first women members factfinding mission in over one decade i would like to enter my full remarks into the record but this evening i wish to say that this was the first ever congressional women members delegation to mexico we were there for over 4 days and our focus was extensive investigations and discussions with individuals from the government as well as the ordinary people of mexico regarding the proposed north american freetrade agreement the bipartisan group of members titled our mission the human face of trade we wanted to open up this agreement and take a look at what it meant not just for the people of the united states and canada but for the people of mexico as well because of course the ordinary people of mexico will not have a chance to speak out on this agreement in that oneparty state our delegation began its journey in mexico city by first meeting with minister of commerce jaime jose serra puche the delegation also met in mexico city with a broad array of environmental humanrights religious and labor organizations comprised of ordinary citizens both in mexico city and in the border communities that we traveled to just south of brownsville tx and mcallen tx in matamoros and reynosa mexico while we were in mexico city our delegation conducted the first ever binational meeting with women legislators from all political parties from both the united states and mexico this event occurred at the home of united states ambassador to mexico john negroponte our delegation visitdd barrios in mexico city and colonias on the border in the matamoros and reynosa we spoke at length with the people who lived there under appalling conditions our delegation discussed border area issues with the residents there with the socalled maquiladora workers who work in the unitedstates companies located south of the border we met with local government officials industry leaders and others gov ann richards of texas made a special effortto fly down to mexico and join our group for an evening of very frank discussions i might say about the proposed nafta agreement our delegation returned from our mission to mexico with these major findings first it is absolutely necessary that the united states and mexico take the time necessary to shape a continental agreement that encompasses the full range of economic social and political issues attendant to such integration the current treaty does not even come close to what is needed the dislocation of jobs of people who have been thrown out of work in the united states and in canada already by unregulated trade confirms the dangers of continuing a handsoff approach to a narrowly cast trade and tariff agreement that does not address these broader issues this is especially true where wage disparities and living conditions are as divergent as they are in the united states and mexico the majority of our meetings were with mexican women who have been most affected by trade policy we have met thousands of united states workers who have lost their jobs to these companies that have located to mexico largely united states companies now over 2 000 of them south of our border with mexico but it is interesting that over 70 percent of the people that have been hired to work in these relocated plants are women mexican women women who live at a subsistence level in fact we met one woman who worked for zenith corp who after 10 years of seniority with our unitedstates company located south of the border takes home for 48 hours of work in a week 15 75 that is her net pay mexicos rising unemployment rate and falling real wages have severely jeopardized the ability of millions of mexicans to fe3d and house their families we met many of these people highwage manufacturing jobs have been drained from communities across our country to lowwage maquiladoras operating in mexico we visited many of these runaway plants along the border but in mexico these jobs have not resulted in rising standards of living for maquiladora workers in fact that was a misconception i had i went down there and i thought if i met the workers in mexico who are workers in these united states firms that have relocated their standard of living would be a little bit higher than people who would be working for mexicanowned companies i found that was not true in fact as you look at what has happened in mexico the rising unemployment rate and falling real wages have severely jeopardized the ability of millions of mexicans to feed and house their families we heard that between 35 and 40 percent of the people of mex ico are now part of what we call the informal sector of their economy that means they do not really get a paycheck that means that they are out there selling chiclets on the street their children are performing as little clowns on the corners to try to pick up little bits of money that they can take home to buy beans and rice for their families it is truly a lowwage economy highwage manufacturing jobs have been drained from communities across our country to these lowwage companies but in mexico these jobs have not resulted in rising standards of living for maquiladora workers but have resulted in a double tragedy because of the subsistence wages that workers are paid so not only do united states workers lose their jobs here but mexican workers earn so very little money that there is not any way for those wages to produce the great booming consumer market that we hear so much about from the proponents of this agreement and why because el pacto the wage agreement between the leaders of the government of mexico industries that have located there and official unions have held wages to onetenth of united states levels in fact even though the government claims there has been an 8 percent increase in wages in mexico over the last year inflation down there in fact is running at 15 percent and interest rates are 35 percent so there is no way for the average family down there to upgrade their standard of living in fact workers in mexico have seen their real wages decline over the last decade and all economists will agree on that we met with apparel workers in mexico city who earn 40 cents an hour we visited people in mexico city neighborhoods who asked us to help them in their efforts to gain the right to food as a part of mexicos constitution because so many of their friends are hungry and we met with them in their neighborhoods saw where they lived went to the neighborhood stores that they tried to set up in a kind of cooperative way trying to buy beans and rice so that they can subsist i asked them how do you define poverty thinking that they would give me a dollar or peso figure definition they said we define poverty as anyone in our country who has less than 60 percent of the calories needed on an average day to merely meet subsistence levels of food and nutrition further it became clear to us that united states companies operating in mexico along with mexicos own domestic firms have enjoyed the addltional advantages of extremely lax enforcement of environmental and labor regulations as well for anyone with a conscience it is disturbing to view the conditions under which the majority of mexican people live our delegation would like to highlight these specific findings and over the weeks we will be bringing more of this information forward to the american people first of all access for mexicans including all of its elected representatives even the fledging opposition party to information about the ongoing trade negotiations we were asked for copies of the proposed treaty the people of mexico have so little information about what is being proposed that the ordinary people including some of their own elected representatives do not have information from the ruling party that information is now tightly controlled by the mexican government inhibiting informed policy making we also were asked that we as members of congress pay more attention to the human impact of mexicos recent economic policies which has gone largely ignored in this country these impacts include unemployment that is approaching 40 percent changes in mexicos land ownership system for its farmers that will drive 10 million more people off the land these people are wandering through mexico flocking into some of the large cities they no longer are growing their own food this is not an inconsequential issue it has an impact on our own immigration policy and also has an impact on whether mexico will be able to become the stable economy as our closest neighbor we saw the inability of wage growth to keep pace with inflation we also noted that mexicos foreign debt has also climbed despite their efforts to try to lower it from s89 billion to 103 billion now the severe economic restraints that they have put on their own people have not resulted in mexico being able to pay off the debts that it owes to foreign banks that is a huge part of the problem they are facing we received a request from concerned mexican scholars that united states and the press investigate the structure of mexicos stock market which they claim is controlled by mexicos wealthiest families allowing them to manipulate it for their profit profit for a very few we received a comhplaint by border communities that the mexican government assesses a housing tax on the lowpaid workers in these maquiladora plants which amounts to over 62 5 million cumulatively last year but these funds were not returned to the border area where housing is desperately needed and where environmental cleanup is desperately needed we received a request that our congress give more attention to the mexican governments preparation of its environmental inspectors which may be inadequate to train them to recognize instances of environmental noncompliance in fact we were told that the average inspector most of them having just been hired because of this agreement being talked about they received about 45 hours of training the north american freetrade agreement as negotiated will not contribute to the promise of raising standards of living for the families of all three nations the negotiated agreements narrow focus on tariff and investment barriers overlooks issues which a true free trade agreement must address real enforcement of labor and environmental laws wage disparities in exportoriented industries accessible dispute resolution which provides justice to citizens and businesses of all three nations and implementation of the polluterpays principle to fund desperately needed environmental cleanup and infrastructure improvements we need more attention to the human rights issue and to the electoral process in mexico itself which even makes their presidential elections called into question because of the manner in which people are treated at the polls and the way votes are counted the gradual and successful integration of the countries of the european community should serve as a model for our own continent we invited the mexican women parliamentarians from all parties to continue discussions with us on these important questions we will reissue that invitation our delegation intends to continue meeting as a working group we are in the process of preparing a detailed report on our findings that we will use to share with our congressional leadership members of congress president clinton and other administration officials as well as the american people we also hope to work with the office of the trade representative to ensure that negotiations on naftas parallel agreements fully address our concerns currently they do not this factfinding mission to mexico was the first step on a journey that will not end until we forge an agreement with mexico that will truly benefit the families of both of our countries and all countries on our continent i thank the chair for its

this process by first congratulating the gentleman from ohio and the members of the republican budget committee in the 8 years that i have been in congress and watched this budget process this is the most professional most dedicated and most real effort that i have seen by any budgeteering group they have got the right conceptual framework that we ought to grow down the size of the government and allow more freedom to grow up the freeenterprise sector of the american economy that only by growth in the private sector can we generate the revenues to support this enormous government spending program and only then can we decrease the deficit if we combine with that growth in revenues from a growing private sector a containment of growth in the public sector it takes courage it takes commitment it takes details a few weeks ago we were challenged on our side of the aisle to put up or shut up and the fact of the matter is the republicans on the committee on the budget put up details pain sacrifice not sacrifice by those of us who senator gramm says are pulling the wagon and paying higher taxes by heaping on more taxes but sacrifice by those who are in the wagon by reductions in government largesse and containment of the size of government what do we have from the democrats the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is the massive tax increases which are immediate and certain on all of the american people and if in fact you happen to be earning 30 000 a year and suffering a tax increase by this clinton plan they will perform the magic of redefinition and give you by a redefinition of your income the status of being a wealthy american by imputing to you through the government alleged earnings of your children the rental value of your home the inside value buildup of your retirement programs the cheating on your taxes that this government under clinton is assuming that we all do by either unreported or underreported income they will make you wealthy this presidency is going to make us all wealthy by simply redefining income now in addition to that pain we have the payoff to all of the government agencies the supporters the communities in addition to all of that payoff in thisgovernment stimulate pork package we have then the promise the promise we have all heard before to the american citizens is once again the democrats have said take the pain of the higher taxes allow us to fulfill the payoff to our constituency groups allow us to provide the pork early and we promise you the cuts later ladies and gentlemen the cuts will not arrive the cuts will not get off the launching pad the cuts are the fiction of democratic budgetary policy the pain is real the suffering is optional vote for kasich vote against the democrats fiction the plan offered by president clinton and the democrat majority and the one developed by the budget committee republicans offer the american people a stark contrast in our respective parties approach to tax and budget policy the democrats want to tax the people and grow the government while republicaos want to grow the private sector and constrain the government the democrat package contains the largest tax increase in american history and tens of billions in new spending by contrast the republican alternative cuts spending and the deficit 430 billion without increasing taxes without slashing defense and without cutting social security the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is massive tax increases which are immediate and certain the payoff is the stimulate government package which even the washington post notes is an effort to reward democrat constituencies with taxpayer money and the promiseone weve heard so many times befores that a few years from now well cut government spending in reality the democrat plan will grow the government and shrink the economy it will mean fewer jobs for ordinary americans particulariy when coupled with the new wave of regulations we are certain to see on behalf of big labor and other special interests the reason job growth has been stagnant is that the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent in the last few years and i remind my democrat friends that during the reagan boomthe longest peacetime expansion of the economy in history it was small business that created 75 percent of the new jobs in america what does the republican plan do it achieves more deficit reduction than the clinton plan by reducing federal spending less than 3 percent thats right 3 percent its appalling that my friends in the democrat majority and the new democrats in the white house would stick the american taxpayer with the largest tax increase in american history while refusing to reduce government by even 3 percent in fact the democrat plan adds tens of billions in new spending while the democrat plan asks all americans to pay higher taxes for more government the republican plan asks the beneficiaries of government largesse to contribute to deficit reduction the republican plan cuts federal overhead reduces congress bloated budget asks wealthy medicare recipients to pay a larger portion of their health care costs requires federal workers to work until age 62 like everyone else instead of retiring at 55 it reforms foreign aid puts medicaid patients in a managed care program and saves taxpayer dollars by empowering lowincome americans to use housing vouchers instead of building expensive crimeridden public housing and best of all the republican plan eliminates unnecessary programs and government agencies like the interstate commerce commission which was created in 1887 to regulate the railroads i would like to compliment my colleague mr kasich and the other republicans on the budget committee for putting together an honest fair and wellbalanced plan that reduces the deficit without raising taxes this plan attacks the root of our deficit problem runaway federal spending balancing the budget and encouraging a prosperous and growing economy requires a twopoint plan we must first limit government spending as this plan daes and we must pass a progrowth package which reduces the cost of capital and labor and encourages our

i do not think that members realize that buried in this socalled lobbying bill is a deliberate grassroots gag rule designed to kill precisely the pressure from back home that has been so effective in this congress let us be honest liberals hate grassroots voter pressure it was voter pressure in support of home schooling that forced the liberals to pull out a provision that would have killed home schooling it is the grassroots pressure of the righttolife movement that has sustained a fight that liberals would have crushed years ago it is the grassroots pressure of people who believe in the second amendment which has stopped the efforts by liberals to strip americans of the right to bear arms it has been the opposition to the clinton tax increase by the grassroots which reduced it to a onevote margin when the entire power structure of washington was going to raise taxes on the american people again and again whether it is school prayer opposition to prohomosexual education in first grade or a range of issues which are not politically correct here in washington it has been the grassroots who have risen up the crowning blow to liberals was the grassroots opposition to the clinton

make a communication to a covered executive branch official or a covered legislative branch official with regard to any matter described here again not lobbying the congress but if you belong to a group and you try to talk to your own group this is now going to be described by the bryant gag rule as something inappropriate c any communication between an organization and any bona fide member of

1994 is to provide for the orderly termination of easements and property used for public utility purposes at the manassas national battlefield park this legislation is necessary to avert a costly and public lawsuit that virginia power will be forced to file should this clarification not become law you may recall that in 1988 the congress passed legislation saving the land where the second battle of manassas occurred thereby avoiding development of this historic civil war battlefield site in so doing the national park service became the owners of an easement which virginia power previously

a 60 millioir lawsuit to compensate them for ther condemned easement and transmission lines this house is responding responsibly to this problemr by extending the time for virginia power and the

preserve its fifth amendment takings claim such a costly suit would be a waste of both federal and virginia powers resources this legislation which is similar to legislation i introduced in may hr

compensation this will save taxpayer money and save virginia powers ratepayers money because virginia power will not have to file a costly lawsuit in federal district court this house should know that

necessary to correct a constitutional problem with the log export legislation that congress passed in n may 4 a federal appeals court overturned that legislation on the grounds that it unconstitutionally compelled a governor to regulate log exports on public lands the bill we bring before you today vests the regulatory authority in the secretary of commerce he is given authority to redelegate this authority to a governor upon request this meets the constitutional test this legislation applies primarily in the pacific northwest in particular the state of washington it affects

on the floor of this house before of a constituent who has a small cleaning business whose name is harry pappas i have known harry for a long time i used to bring cleaning to his establishment yearsago i had not heard from him since i have been a member of this body but he called and he said rosa i never make a call like this but he said i received a package of information and it told me to call you to tell you to vote against health care reform because in fact this was going to hurt my business it would put me out of business and he said they also included for me a worksheet to put down the facts and figures in my business to see how much more it would cost if we went this route the fact of the matter is that harry did that he took the time as the gentleman said took the pencil to the paper took the pencil to the paper and to the worksheet and laid it out and lo and behold what he found is that it was going to cost him 17 percent less than he was paying now and he was trying to take care and he is trying to cover his employees so the purpose of his call would up being to encourage me to move forward in voting on health care reform the point again is let us give the american

needed for two reasons first of all we need it for the necessary discipline to cause this house to do what we cannot seem to do on our own in the ordinary budget process we need the discipline of a constitutional requirement of balancing the federal governments budget that is the first reason the second reason is that we need frankly to create a crisis by the passage of the balanced budget amendment make no mistake about it as a member of the committee on the budget i am well aware that passing the balanced budget amendment will create a crisis in our budgetary process because it will mean that all of us will have to come to the table to figure out how to balance a budget that is terribly terribly out of balance that will require that crisis will create an environment where we will come together i believe just as this country has come together before with other crises where we have been faced with an outside threat we will forget republican and democrat differences we will come together at a table where we can figure out together how to balance the budget and do what we all know we need to do yesterday i was in greer sc doing what i call a walking town meeting which basically means picking out a street walking down and finding out what america thinks the interesting thing i found out yesterday in greer is that on that street of ordinary americans everyone there is living currently under a balanced budget amendment in their homes they cannot do what we do here spending and spending and writing new checks because as members know in that neighborhood in greer sc eventually the sheriff comes for those folks who do that sort of thing but here in the congress we can get away with it forever and ever continuing to run imbalanced budgets actually though we cannot get away with it forever because sooner or later we will have to pay the piper i think that for my sake and for i hope the other members here what we have got to do is make sure that we do not expect our grandchildren to pay the piper we have got to deal with it now we have to pass the balanced budget amendment now create the crisis get everyone to the table and figure out how to balance

important components of the mission of the state park and wildlife service is the maintenance of wildlife guzzlers those members not familiar with guzzlers they provide an artificial water supply in areas where much of the traditional water supply has disappeared water in this area has always been a scarce commodity the result of this lack of water has been the steady decline of wildlife populations that is until the conservation efforts of those who build and continue to maintain the guzzlers these guzzlers have been the central reason for the reinvigoration of the bighorn sheep however it is very apparent that gamble quail chucker partridge jack rabbits and lizards are all beneficiaries of guzzlers as well without the extensive guzzler system that exists throughout the california desert the majority of these animals would cease to exist in this region i am uncertain as to whether or not that is the goal of the two gentlewomen from california and the gentleman from california the chairman and the gentleman from california the authors of this bill before us i do know that the members have a tendency as the hours grow late to become impatient with extended debate i hope this will not be extended but i would say to my colleagues it is relatively rare for me to rise on this floor and discuss extensively any subject but in this case we are talking about a subject that is fundamental to those who live in and love the desert we do appreciate your assistance as well as your attention to maintain existing guzzlers or build new ones motorized access to the desert regions involved is essential we are talking about construction materials ranging from water storage tanks to heavyduty piping this material simply put cannot be carried on foot or horseback to the areas that are involved motorized access is essential if we are serious about maintaining or even expanding existingwildlife populations at the very least 4wheel drive vehicles are necessary to access these remote areas inmany instances helicopters are necessary to move bulky and cumbersome equipment into the areas concerned the point i am trying to make here is that currently the state of california serves as the lead agency in the maintenance and expansion of these wildlife populations it is a fact that the park service has a different charge and mandate under federal law if the park service is able to veto access to these areas on the part of state agencies or voluntary groups we are very concerned that the preservation of species involved could indeed be cut off and undermined i will repeat to the members it was in 1978 when the oregon pipe national monument in arizona was designated as a wilderness there were a number of wild guzzlers in the wilderness since then all those guzzlers have been phased out in accordance with park policy we are trying to make absolutely certain that such arbitrary action does not take place and undermine the conservation and preservation of

balances the needs of both sides of the debate richardson does not fortythree states allow the use of flow control authority most as a base for environmentally sound solid waste management laws richardson would effectively make compliance with many of those laws impossible because the laws were based on flow control authority under the richardson language scores of communities who have made substantial financial commitments could be left without the means to acomplish waste management goals required by state law proponents of richardson argue that flow control leads to incineration and supporting this amendment will result in a reduction in exposure to dioxin this argument ignores that incineration is strictly regulated by epa and a choice a community should make finally to say the committee bill eliminates competition in the marketplace is wrong i am a strong advocate of competition and worked to insure that any flow control legislation include a requirement that competitive
