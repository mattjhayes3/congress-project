steadfast commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the honorable congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will

house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth

your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement

make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who

forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican

protection agency to protect public health and the environment as ranking member of the science committee i am certainly familiar with the antiepa rhetoric emanating from too many on the majority side fortunately their attempts to override the growing chorus of american voices demanding action on climate change is failing and communities across the nation are showing strong support for epas efforts to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions implement tighter ozone standards and protect public health unfortunately there are those in this house who apparently have turned a deaf ear to the american people and instead provide a forum for those who seek to undermine epas work seemingly at every turn this bill is another vehicle for implementing those obstructive views there is no greater evidence of this reality than the blanket prohibition found in this bill on any epa action to address methane emissions from the oil and gas industry while the people in california are still reeling from the largest methane leak in unitedstates history it seems unconscionable to me that we would prohibit epa from taking any action on issues related to methane emissions in addition some of my republican colleagues have grown fond of insisting that epa should only rely on publically available scientific information to support their rules and actions while the goal of a transparent government is laudable the consequence of their insistence is not a more transparent epa but an epa that would be limited as to what science they may consider as my colleagues and i have said before we cannot support a bill and accompanying report that limits or prohibits epa from using the best and most relevant science moreover in response to perceived delays in providing documents requested by congress the authors of this legislation would seemingly punish the hardworking men and women of epas congressional affairs office by reducing their budget request by 4 million dollars if my colleagues really want to address epas inability to provide timely responses to an ever increasing amount of congressional document requests they would not cut the budget of the office tasked with providing those responses it may feel good to those proposing the cut but it is a selfdefeating approach to addressing the ostensible problem finally i would note that a number of amendments have been made in order that if adopted will only make a bad bill worse i intended to oppose them when they come up for votes in closing i cannot support an appropriations bill that among its defects would diminish the

session of the 114th congress it has been an honor and a privilege to work closely with her she has done such a phenomenal job not just on behalf of the people she represents in the great city of columbus ohio but all throughout the nation in her various roles and certainly in her leadership in the congressional black caucus it is with a heavy heart that i stand on the floor of the house of representatives today and with great sadness acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in orlando florida the worst mass shooting in the history of the united states of america it is a complicated shooting we understand that it most likely is an act of terror a hate crime of unspeakable proportions there are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse the shooter appeared to have been in some measure on the fbis radar but you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in congress have the capacity to deal with and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destructionwhich should be reserved for war not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic republicand inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others martin luther king jr once said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends during the 114th congress there have been more than 100 mass shootings we often come to the floor of the house of representatives and the speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us as members of the house to stand in a moment of silence and then we go on with business as usual having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in america the rest of the world is looking around and saying what are they doing in the united states of america five percent of the worlds population 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land the fbi and local law enforcement cant tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice this is an issue of course that has great impact on the african american community homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger african american men so we in the cbc view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community i think it is one that all americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country but the thing that is also troublingand we will have time to deal with this tragedyis hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list cant purchase weapons of mass destruction how complicated is that to do but the thing that is striking for many of us in the african american community is that when you look at some of the leading causes of deathheart disease being number one and then of course diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic certain forms of cancer hiv aids infectionmany of these illnesses these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that i represent in central brooklyn in bedfordstuyvesant in east new york in ocean hillbrownsville in canarsie and in the west end of coney island are preventable preventable by better exercise preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many lowincome communities of color have been subjected to resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness preventable by better diet senator booker recently said to many of usand this has stuck with methat more african americans in the united states of america die as a result of drivethroughs not drivebys that is because the diet the access to healthy food is limited the food deserts within which many african americans particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level are forced to reside in are scandalous so we in the congressional black caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful comprehensive fashion i am thankful that back at home in the west end of coney island coney island cathedral one of the most important religious institutions in brooklyn is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists a lack of access to healthy food in the black community it is a campaign that we want to take across the nation we are thankful for the work that has been done by the congressional black caucus and by president obama through his leadership of the affordable care act we now know that over 20 million previously uninsured americans now have access to quality affordable health caredisproportionately african american that is a positive step in the right direction but instead of trying to dismantle this monumental step forward as house republicans have attempted to do more than 60 times over the last few years they have a

delegate norton offered to the bill during markup but it was rejected by the committee on oversight and government reform the amendment would cap the enrollment of osp students the opportunity scholarship program at 50 percent of the schools population without affecting current voucher students or siblings the amendment would also restore the randomized controlled study requirement this program is about opportunity and choice parents should be able to choose the best schools for their children and private schools should have the flexibility to determine whether or not to enroll osp students i understand the delegates concern that students maintain quality standards in fact i share it that is why h r 10 requires participating osp schools to achieve accreditation no later than 5 years after the passage of the act this is a more effective way to ensure the quality than by arbitrarily excluding students from the program the accreditation process required by h r 10 will ensure education and administrative quality control the process will help weed out poor performers from this program without setting a cap on osp student enrollment as for the return to the control group evaluation this is unnecessary for the osp the osp has been rigorously evaluated using the gold standard since 2003 and it has demonstrated positive results the gold standard evaluation using a randomized controlled evaluation deliberately limits participation in the program under this evaluation method some student applicants received scholarships while other student applicants were placed in a control group that did not receive scholarships given the osps proven success under this standard it is time to allow as many students to receive scholarships as funding permits it is important to note that the bill does not forsake evaluation instead the bill requires the osp students performance base to be compared to that of students of similar backgrounds of the d c public schools the evaluation method means no more students will be barred from a good education through osp for the sake of the experiment on average 2 5 students apply for each scholarship that is ultimately awarded we should be focused on meeting the demand for access to a good education rather than arbitrarily limiting students ability to succeed i urge my colleagues to reject this amendment which would

a good amendment i support it all of us agree that if someone has risked their lives or would be in danger for supporting the united states and our folks in afghanistan then that person needs

and sent it to the president yesterday passing tpa i believe is an achievement that this congress should be very proud of it is going to empower congress in trade negotiations it will help america get the best possible trade agreements for american workers and it will tell the world that the america that they knew and the america that they know is an america that is still willing to lead i especially want to thank my colleagues in the house like congressman ron kind and congressman earl blumenauer for their leadership on this issue i also want to thank our friends in the senate like senators hatch and wyden but to pass tpa we needed a little bit of trust we promised our democratic friends if they stay with us on tpa that we will follow through with this bill that is before us today and so we are here today to keep our word there are three parts to this bill all three of which have bipartisan support first we reauthorize the trade adjustment assistance act which is in keeping with the agreements that we have made this program helps workers whose jobs have moved elsewhere to find new opportunities through job training traditionally we have always authorized tpa and taa and that is what we are doing here we have always authorized them together and that is effectively what we are doing here we have made some improvements to the program second we reauthorize a number of trade preferences for developing countries this bill reauthorizes a number of programs that have broad bipartisan support agoa gsp and haiti hope these programs lower trade barriers between our country and these developing countries it is the best example of trade not aid that you can come up with they grow our trading ties because when we grow they grow this is good policy that has been well respected and supported by both sides of the aisle therefore we have every incentive to get this done third we make sure that our companies can use our trade remedy laws to address unfair trade practices this is something that we have worked with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle our colleagues from steel country and the house steel caucus to make sure that our trade laws are actually enforced and when our trade laws are not being followed when they are being abused that we have quick remedies to these situations all of this legislation will strengthen the american economy it will strengthen americas credibility on the world stage and it will strengthen american leadership with that i urge its passage i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0007083415985107422,

the dragon lady one of the must successful spy planes ever built its unique capabilities have served our nations highaltitude intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance mission for decades what many dont know is that the u2 is not a cold war relic it is still current the most recent ones were made in the 1980s u2s are currently flying more hours today than at any point since the end of the cold war and have been deployed in our ongoing efforts to defeat isis flying at an altitude of 70 000 feet the u2 is able to reach heights other spy planes cannot because the u2 can reach such extraordinary heights it is able to use hightech sensors to increase its ability to collect intelligence other unique features of the u2 include cloudpiercing radar and interchangeable nose cones the u2 can also take incredible highresolution photographs on a 10 500foot reel wet film my amendment to the ndaa will prevent the air force from retiring the u2 it is absolutely essential to our ability

have the fish and wildlife service and their scientists manage it or we can get rid of it and just have the court do it so it appears that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle when things dont go the way they like by the fish and wildlife service they are fully supportive of the court system when things dont go right in the court system it appears that they are fully supportive of the fish and wildlife service what i would prefer is that we protect the endangered species act and the agency that was directed to manage it and to manage these rare populations or endangered species like the gray wolf in the 1990sand i am from wisconsinthere were only a handful of mating pairs of gray wolves in northern wisconsin throughout the great lakes region today there are 3 700 wolves in this area it is an economically and ecologically unsustainable number the fish and wildlife service rightly decided that the population had recovered and that their program to protect this species had been so completely successful that it was time to delist and turn the power back to the states to manage which in fact they were doing until a court decided that the fish and wildlife service and the experts there protecting the endangered species act just didnt get it right well we cannot have it both ways mr chair and it is time that this congress tells the courts what the laws are and how we want these things managed what we are doing here in this bill and in the underlying language is protecting both the endangered species act and the fish and wildlife service scientists who are giving the proper jurisdiction to manage endangered species including the gray wolf"]]}
