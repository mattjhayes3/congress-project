really believe raoul wallenberg was such an individual today we can see better how to combat the darkness in the world because of the inspired life of raoul wallenberg i had the honor of testifying on this joint resolution of which im a cosponsor as a representative of the simon wiesenthal institute on the holocaust in los angeles calif it was the great efforts of the people at the institute that helped alert many members of congress to the need in the worldi today to study and remember the holocaust to assure the world jew and christian alike that there will never again be a time such as we experienced in this world during the 1930s and 1940s raoul wallenberg is one of those rare individuals whose light not only shone in terms of his ability to safeguard jewish lives but whose light shines to all of us today as a humanitarian i think he is alive and i happen to believe that the soviet union knows where he is and that this resolution will force open his case for all the world to see i want the world to know that there are members of congress on both sides of the aisle who testified during the hearings as reflected today in this joint resolution who not only cosponsored it but who would willingly vote for it it will then be signed by the president and i hope the president signs it with the type of ceremony that will send a signal that will shine across the world right in the deepest and darkest places of the gulag archipelago and say to the soviet union that america and its people jew and gentile alike refuse to forget raoul wallenberg and that we stand beside him and what he did not only on behalf of jews but for all people who suffer i want this light to shine for other people unjustly imprisoned by the soviets who have no other hope for freedom than our intervention like anatoly shcharp nky who has been languishing in a soviet prison for over 4 years and whose wife calls me from israel to plead on his behalf and for ida nudel and all others like them it is important to note that raoul wallenberg acted on behalf of the united states it is through him that we can claim that we did intervene to help save the jewish people from total annihilation that we did not just stand aside and allow this to happen we do not bestow this honor lightly that of honorary citizenship this is an action we are taking to enable us to recognize one man who had the courage to take a stand in a germanoccupied country and singlehandely save thousands of lives acting in the name of the united states as well as his native sweden he should be justly rewarded for his efforts and i can think of no reward greater or more fitting than to acknowledge his actions for our country by giving him our citizenship and there is poetic justice in granting raoul wallenberg unitedstates citizenship one of his most successful tactics was to issue paperg to the hungarian jews giving them swedish citizenship and protection we are now doing for this one man what he did for 100 000 honorary citizenship for raoul wallenberg will give us the diplomatic leverage we need to pursue this matter with the soviets and we must do this tenaciously with the same motivation and success with which raoul wallenberg acted so many years ago we must not allow the soviets to bury him or his memory which is so very much alive to all of us today raoul wallenberg is a true hero he has proven that the human spirit is capble of achieving great things for no personal gain it is by his act of courage of sacrifice of selflessness that all of humanity is redeemed he did more than save thousands of lives he was and continues to be a symbol of hope to millions who suffer at the september 22 1981 co hands of tyrants his very name is a ray of light illuminating the darkness and the depths of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis in world war ii and who suffer now at the hands of the soviet oppressors raoul wallenberg has symbolized all of this for the past 40 years his contribution to civilization is immeasurable and while we honor him with our citizenship we too should be honored that he chose to act on our behalf i am pleased to be a part of this effort i

executive committee were most disturbed by press reports that the administration might settle its dispute over steel imports with the europeans through bilateral agreements which would not protect the interests of the american steel industry according to the reports much pressure was being exerted by the european economic community eec to reach a settlement that would prove unfavorable to our domestic producers consequently the executive committee met in an emergency meeting on thursday morning july 21 1982 and agreed unanimously to inform secretary of commerce malcolm baldrige of opposition to the european offer that same night secretary baldrige rejected the european offer to limit steel exports to 90 percent of the 1981 levels i would like to submit here for the record the official press release of the commerce department on this decision the unitedstates department of commerce could not accept a lastminute proposal by the european communities ec to suspend 12 steel countervailing duty cvd investigalions involving belgium france italy and the united kingdom because the legal requirement of removing the apparent injurious effects caused to the unitedstates industry by subsidized steel imports was not met the proposals were formally presented to commerce secretary malcolm baldrige at 5 30 thursday by the ambassadors of the four countries accompanied by representatives of the ec the contents of the proposals had been received that morning the ec requested that the commerce department suspend the investigation on the basis of quantitative restraint agreements as permitted in unitedstates law under that provision the deadline for reaching an agreement is midnight july 24 in announcing his decision baldrige said we welcome any attempt by the community to settle the unfair steel trade cases between the unitedstates and the ec but unfortunately these proposals are not legally acceptable unitedstates law requires that any quantitative restraint suspension agreement must eliminate the injurious effect of subsidized exports of the subject merchandise to the united states since the steel imports from the ec that caused the injury increased almost 30 percent from 1980 to 1981 the 10 percent reduction offered today from the higher 1981 levels was simply not sufficient to remove injury as required baldrige stated that if acceptable suspension agreements could have been concluded on these products the steel trade tension between the ec and the unitedstates would still not have been eliminated he noted that 19 antidumping ad cases on the same products and 13 other ad and cvd cases are still pending baldrige felt that an overall settlement leading to withdrawal of all cases was the best way to relieve the current trade tension and repeated his willingness to continue discussions with the ec to find an equitable basis to deal with the problem in its entirety as well as the proposed suspension agreements the ec required that the unitedstates accept all of the 12 proposed agreements or none in its decision the doc compared the ecs suggested restraint level to the levels at which the unitedstates international trade commission made preliminary determinations of injury in 1980 and 1982 most of the proposed restraint levels were above the levels found to be injurious by the itc doc also considered the current state of the unitedstates industry now running at less than 45 percent utilization and the level of subsidies found in the june 10 preliminary determinations which in one case amounts to 40 percent subsequent to that decision the secretary made a counterproposal to the eec that provided about a 20percent cut in steel imports unfortunately the europeans turned that proposal down in the meantime in accordance to the relevant trade laws future negotiations on these cases will require the commerce department to seek the approval of the domestic steel industry before reaching a settlement now i have been advised that the secretary will pursue additional discussions along these lines this week in brussels it would seem to be in the interests of the european community to 11 4692 co participate in these negotiations otherwise they will risk final determinations and penalties i urge the secretary to do everything in his power to settle these cases as soon as possible in order to get our steelworkers back on the job a mr bevill the war being waged against the american steel industry by foreign steel producers has taken yet another twist news reports indicate that several of the european governments which have been accused of subsidizing their steel mills and permitting them to dump their steel in this country at prices far below production costs have been applying equally unfair pressure on this government to let them plea bargain their way out of the trade suits filed against them these news reports indicate that the europeans have used the russian gas pipeline deal and other diplomatic issues in an attempt to exert a form of international blackmail against our government they want to force a negotiated settlement without the consent of the injured american steelmakers which brought the complaints if they are successful our domestic steel firms would suffer even further losses of jobs sales and would have to have longer delays in their efforts to modernize their plants further the european nations pressuring for favorable settlements want a guarantee that there will be no future filings against them of additional antidumping cases or countervailing duty that would provide them with free reign to systematically destroy our domestic steel production capabilities already basic steel employment in america stands at a depressing 49year low if current trends continue our steel producers can expect to lose 2 billion during this decade and another 100 000 american steelworkers will be without jobs as a member of the executive committee of the steel caucus i want to express in the strongest terms possible my sincere belief that our government must not turn its back on our own steelmakers who have lived within the law the cases they have filed are a test of the law and i believe americans want to see that law enforced the world is watching this important trade issue and our future international trade could be affected greatly by the outcome if the law is not enforced in this area we are sacrificing one of our most important industries america has been a good trading partner for the world we have produced

alternative which we have to correct these abuses is to make technical amendments in the existing fuel use act which will force the doe to correct procedural abuses placed upon parties affected by the overreaching regulations this is what the fuel use regulatory reform act of 1980 is designed to do i am very serious about pursuing this legislation if the department of energy does not take a more

past of not meeting ridership and cost criteria and service was actually suspended for a brief period last winter however due to overwhelming congressional support for the cardinal and the interest shown by our friend and colleague the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on transportation the late adam benjamin language was pdded to an appropriations measure whitch reinstated the cardinal the cardinal makes west virginia stops in prince thurmond white sulphur springs charleston and huntington becasue of increased promotional activities improved ontime performance and some rescheduling the cardinal is now well on its way to being a topnotch performer the cardinal has a great deal of support among the people in southern west virginia and offers them one of the few transportation opportunities they have left outside of private automobile use i commend the members of the appropriations committee for their diligence in putting together this bill and urge all my colleagues to support it"], [0.0002804398536682129, 0.5002804398536682, 1, "i take this special order this evening to provide the members of the house an opportunity to salute two of our colleagues from ohio upon their retirement from congressron mottl and bos shamansky both of these men have made invaluable contributions to this house during their time here both of them were hard working and dedicated members of the ohio delegation and were devoted to the representation of their congressional districts and the state of ohio and while we will miss both of them for different reasons both ron and bob will be missed each of them made many friends here and each leaves his own indelible imprint on this house first i want to direct my remarks to my friend ron ron before coming to congress had served in the ohio legislature at the same time my brother carl served in that body so i knew of him by reputation carl spoke highly of rons legislative skills and of the friendship they had enjoyed during their service together in fact ron has quite a distinguished career before ever coming to this body as a lawyer he had been an assistant law director for the city of cleveland he has been a member of the parma city council and had demonstrated his leadership by becoming president of that body he then served one term in the ohio legislature as a state representative before being elected to the ohio state senate where he served 5 years and so ron had a very distinguished career before ever coming to congress i will miss our early monday morning flights out of cleveland together which gave me the opportunity to really get to know ron i appreciated that opportunity to know him because during his four terms in congress lie and i have had strong differences on issues which were on the floor of the house and those issues on occasions engendered heated debate on both sides of the issues but while we have differed philosophically on issues we were never disagreeable nor did we let our philosophical differences interfere with our personal friendship ron believed in the positions which he fought for and i respect him for that i have never doubted his sincerity i also appreciate the cooperation and support he always gave me as dean of our delegation ron believes strongly that regular meetings of our democratic delegation and of our total delegation would enable us to do a better job of getting more federal funds for our state his dedication to delegation unity will in behalf of the state of ohio will be remembered and appreciated shortly after arriving in washington ron initiated what has become his hallmark back in the districtoutstanding and constant service within the community ron has been able to deliver the kind of oneonone services to the people of parma time and time again he has maintained close ties with the folks back home and in fact can boast proudly that he never spent a weekend in washington since he was elected i said earlier that ron had made an indelible imprint on this body as a member of the house cominerce committee ron teamed up with labor and consumer groups on many energy issues he opposed president carters decision to remove price controls on crude oil and argued the consumer case against major oil companics before congressional committees furthermore he has gained a national reputation and national respect for his work on the house veterans affairs committee where he is the fifth ranking democrat on that committee ron serves as the chairman of the hospitals and health care subcommittee when i think of veterans hospitals and legislation alfecting them the first name that comes to my mind is that of ron mottl we need only to look at the list of his achievements on behalf of this nations veterans to justify that statement first ron mortl was the force behind the investigation which led to the conviction of 33 persons on drug and other charges at the wade park and brecksville veterans admiinistration hospitals in cleveland second it was ron mottl who won authorization for free medical care for veterans who may have been affected by agent orange third va doctors and nurscs have this representative to thank for their upgraded pay scale fourth ron mottl has been the guidin force in getting the defense departriient and the va to agree to share medical facilities during national emergencies and the list of achievements in this area goes on and on in other initiatives during his fourterm tenure ron won passage of legislation requiring banks to pay interest on social security and income tax funds held by them he has introduced h r 6427 the motor vehicle title and inspection act of 1982 which i have informed ron that i will reintroduce and push in the 98th congress during the 8 years in the congress ron maintained a 92 percent voting participation record when taking into consideration his active role with his constituents and the indelible mark he has made on key legislation it is evident that ron mottl has literally given 110 percent of his energies and expertise to this body and this nation i shall miss his talents his expertise and his friendship tremendously in the 98th congress we are also here this evening to salute the gentleman from ohios 12th congressional district congressman bob shamansky who will not be returning to the 98th congress boa has been one of the most active members of the 97th congress his aggressive action and sometimes witty statements on key legislation have earned him well deserved respect and a reputation as one of the brightest members of the freshman class of the 97th congress as a freshman congressman bob shamasky rolled up his sleeves and went right to work he took the lead in opposition to the tobacco allocation and price support program and came close to defeating it and because of his efforts changes already have been made in the program further he took the lead in the house in introducing reforms to the manner in which social security trust fund investments are made even the most senior members in the house have been leery of tackling this complicated and sensitive issue furthermore boa shamansky has been a champion in the area of housing legislation he acted early upon arriving in the house offering legislation to stimulate the depressed housing industry his major goal has been adequate and affordable housing for all americans additionally boa has been an activist in almost every piece of progressive legislation considered by the house he consistently opposed funding for the clinch river breeder reactor he vigorously backed the extension of the voting rights act and he is a cosponsor of the era amendment finally boa has stood for consumers in opposing special agricultural marketing orders and in supporting the ftcs disclosure rule on used car sales what has impressed me probably the most about boa is his commitment to the disadvantaged in the nation when i looked in the congressional record to see how members of the ohio delegation voted on legislation that affected minorities and the poor every time boa shamansky went on record as voting for measures that would help the downtrodden in this nation these were not token efforts but a reflection of his sincere belief about the role of our government i thank boa for that unceasing support finally as a member of the foreign affairs committee the science and technology committee and the house select committee on aging bob shamansky has gained a reputation for his preparation and analytical skills these skills and the willingness to serve the people of not only ohios 12th district but the entire state have earned my colleague bob shamansky the respect of all of us in the delegation as dean of the ohio democratic delegation i want to express to bob my sincere and personal appreciation for his support in behalf of me and our delegation whenever i called a meeting he was always there and always made a contribution in behalf of his constituency and his state bob is a very able and learned man who made a significant contribution to this nation while serving in congress we will sorely miss him in the 98th congress"],

providence has always seemed to be kindly disposed toward americabrought forth george washington to gain our independence thomas jefferson to teach us democracy and abraham lincoln to save our union surely that same beneficent providence on march 4 1933 lifted up franklin delano roosevelt and his great wife eleanor to rehabilitate and restore america and to lead the free world to a great victory over a terrible despotism and tyranny the nation upon which president roosevelt looked that day was prostrate almost in body and nearly broken in spirit not only were there millions unemployed hundreds of thousands who had lost their homes and their farms to foreclosure huts built in public parks were the only dwelling place for many more with no food except what the soup kitchen would provide and perhaps even worse groups of boys and girls out of school hoboing from city to city like a pack of hungry wolves seeking food shelter and a job but when that remarkable man began to speak to that audience standing in the snow around the inaugural platform and the millions listening over the radio in the land heard that marvelous voice when they received the contagion of his dynamic spirit when they sensed his own courage and confidence in their hearts was born a new faith and a new hope and upon that new faith and hope a new america was born i personally believe that when the man franklin d roosevelt realized the awesome responsibility he assumed as he took the oath of office that day his natural strength of character refined in the crucible of long suffering made a new franklin d roosevelta man of even new courage and faith and confidence as long as free men shall write history a brilliant chapter in the story of man will be about franklin and eleanor roosevelt about their years in the white house their leadership of america their leadership of the free world and the kind of a nation and the kind of a world they left as legacies to their fellow citizens now and of succeeding generations it was my privilege from 1936 until he passed away to have enjoyed the privilege like many of my colleagues of working with president roosevelt i came from the south that needed help and here was a helping hand i proudly embraced it and what he did for our south we shall never forget what he did for america will live forever but those of us who had the privilege of personal contact with the president know that it was an immeasurable experience always to come into his presence was a thrilling exercise you never knew exactly what sort of an experience you would have because he was full of ingenuity full of innovation full of doing things in his own peculiar way i remember one instance when i went to see him about a project that a lot of my people down in florida were pressing me about the president evidently knew what i was coming to talk about he satisfied his mind that he had already done all he could to help me in that matter so when i went in and sat down at the presidents desk he said hello claude how are you i said fine mr president i got my breath and started to talk about my project he said claude have you ever read very much about robert livingston he said robert livingston was one of my wifes ancestors he was one of our greatest americans well i was nodding my head and listening respectfully as the president went ahead telling me about robert livingston but he went on and on and i was still nodding my head and had not said a word about my project finally after a little whileand all of the members of congress know what that meansmarvin mcintyre the presidents appointment secretary came in and took his place standing there beside me well of course i knew that meant my time was up and i had not said a word about my project well i started to say mr president and by that time the camera men were coming in setting up their cameras the press was pouring in and filling up the oval office and in a little bit the president said in his most ingratiating manner claude i am so glad that you came i have enjoyed seeing you come to see me again sometime but i started to say but mr president he said you know i have got a press conference here now claude and i cannot keep these people waiting thank you very much i will see you soon well when i got back to my office i said well i did not make much progress on my project but i am the best informed man on robert livingston there is on capitol hill there are three main legacies i venture to suggest which president roosevelt left to our country and to the free world the first is he showed by his own example and leadership that the government of the united states belongs to the people of this land and that whenever their troubles and their disasters and their needs impel its use it is available it is the mightiest institution on the face of the earth and it can be a hand that will lift up the people if they call upon it there will be differences in the needs the people have for that government there will be differences in the attitude of those in charge of that government toward the administration of such needs from time to time but whenever the needs shall occur and be of sufficient gravity to make the demand proper and reasonable you may be sure that the people of the united states will never let any president or any congress forget that franklin d roosevelt and the congresses that worked with him came to the aid of a suffering people when they needed and they called upon it for help and a second great legacy president roosevelt left to us and that is that compassion genuine concern for ones fellow man should be in the heart of every man or woman who assumes the awesome responsiblities of public office i rather believe that president roosevelt would not have objected to every person after taking the oath of public office being required to reread jesus parable of the good samaritan to be reminded that he was simply not to operate a cold machine he was to help as far as would be proper and possible people to live richer healthier and happier lives i remember a lady from warm springs saying when she was a girl in warm springs she always loved to see the president whenever she could and he often came to her home and she said that as a girl she always looked upon the president as sort of a kind uncle everywhere he touched roosevelt left the warmth of his generous spirit the third legacy is the place where he left america in center stage of world affairs no more would another president have to pull a reluctant country to an acquaintance with its responsibilities against terrible despotism in the world america as roosevelt left it will be in center stage among the nations of the earth standing up for what is right opposing what is wrong and trying to build the institutions that will preserve the peace and the happiness of mankind so today we proudly commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of what they then called that fine baby boy to sara delano roosevelt at hyde park we proudly today attest our own respect our admiration and our affeetion for that great and good man franklin delano roosevelt for his devotion to his god and his fellow man and his deep dedication to the service of both and we leave him now again to sleep forever in honored glory with the lines spoken at hyde park by his old minister when he was laid to rest the refrain of an old hymn father in thy gracious keeping leave we now thy servant sleeping"], [0.0003693699836730957, 0.4996306300163269, 0, "the debate that we are involved in now occurs on the f a18 and this will really be i think the final debate that we will have to determine the fate of the air arm of our unitedstates navy s far as a followon fighter attack rarcraft is concerned it is critical to tile defense of our country r think that it can be said that any weapon system that we come up with with the state of technology that we understand and have before us today can be criticized indeed the f alb has been criticized basically i feel on two aspects first of all that it will not do what it is supposed to do and the second one is of course cost in cost comparison first the f alb is an expensive airplane i do not think anybody ever disagreed with that concept but it is also an airplane that because of its state at the present time and its testing and evaluation is an airplane that will be fixed tactical and operable when it goes into service in the fleet which will start at the beginning of next year that is to say the fixes will be done and it will be expensive but even now the cost per copy of the f alb is going down as we bring production up to what it ought to be to compare the f a18 to the f16 or the a7 or the a6 really is an apples and oranges argument bjecause the f alb is the f alb and it is a superb aircraft as far as the fixes are concerned there was the roll rate problem i am sure everybody associates with the f a18 the roll rate problcm in this regard let me say that the navy set out a set of goals that no nation no aerospace firm no weapon system no airplane has ever achieved but that is what the navy said ought to be the goal for roll rate among thier things of the f alb and the original f a18 did not make it and so they put some fixes in they extended the ailerons and did some leading edge flap adjustrment on the onboard computer and this and that and they substantially increased the roll rate to where i understand that it is better than any other roll rate in any other tactical aircraft now but it does not meet the goal that has never been met and that is a criticism but i would say to my colleagues that it is an invalid criticism as far as range let me say this that the range problem given the a7 has more range than the a6 they use everything they have to get off the deck and if you run the f ala on the same power off of a catapult you are in afterburner and do not need to be and there goes your fuel so the range is less the f alb at the same speed or at a greater speed without the afterburner can get to altitude to target to back through escape and go far faster than any other navy aircraft in these brief moments let me say we are going to decide the fate of whether or not the navy gets a new airplane or wants to go backward in technology to an airplane that cannot defend the target and not defend the fleet or we go ahead with an aircraft that is indeed one of the finest ever produced by this or any other country i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
