at night and this is the last speech of the 106th congress as i understand it the last three quarters of an hour which you will be presiding over this house i wish the gentleman tremendous luck and tremendous good fortune as the gentleman leaves this house i want to thank the gentleman for his service to this house and to this nation and particularly his service as a presiding officer over this house which he has done so many times i especially want to thank you in advance for your indulgence during the next three quarters of an hour i also want to thank the house for this opportunity to address the house in the closing minutes of the 106th congress and take this opportunity to wish all of my colleagues happy holidays and a happy and productive new year we come to the end of the 106th congress and we come to the conclusion of the selection of the 43rd president of the united states perhaps more in exhaustion than in glee having severely tested our constitutional structure when we come back next year we need to do so in the spirit of bipartisanship and i think in that spirit we need to address some of the issues as to which there is no democrat policy no republican policy but issues that go to the structure of our democracy issues that we need to confront now to avoid the constitutional crisis of coming decades issues that go to the structure of 6ur government and go to protecting the presidency from challenges that it could face in the decades to come i have been asked who could have imagined the problems that we have faced over the last month the fact of the matter is anyone with a good imagination could have imagined these problems and hundreds of others we simply need to look at the technical mechanisms for our government for our constitution and for our democracy in order to identify those issues that could present crisis in the future now there are a variety of different kinds of problems this country faces as to which members of congress are not to be expected to have indepth expertise in my own state there are tremendous problems dealing with the generation and distribution of electric power and few members of the state legislature of this congress have indepth expertise or experience in matters of electric power but when it comes to government and politics and voting that is the one area where we are experts it is time that we turn that expertise to making sure that all of the foreseeable problems that could go to the structure of our government are given attention and hopefully are solved these are problems and i will address nine different problems in the remainder of any speech that have not gotten much attention they are problems that we are not lobbied by the insurance industry or the physicians the nifb has no position nor does the aflcio neither the sugar producers nor the candy makers have a stake in the outcome directly none of the hundreds of lobbyists and constituent groups that have come to our office in the last 2 years have even addressed these issues given what has happened in florida we will begin to hear of one or two of them but we should address them all and others besides because i am not confident that i have the right answers i am not confident that i have identified all of the relevant questions but i am sure that it is time for this house to imagine those mechanical threats those threats to the mechanics to our democracy that could occur not just in the next few years but in the coming many decades if i had come to this floor 6 months ago and said that chad posed a risk to our democracy a member of the committee on national security would have responded that the west african nation of chad posed no threat to us that it was not the site of terrorism nor military threat yet we must defend our democracy not only from the most obscure sources of international attack but from those things that could undermine faith in our institutions we have learned that the word chad does not only apply to a nation in west africa but refers to just one of many mechanical problems that could undermine our faith in those institutions it is not enough for us to address just what happened in florida because tomorrows constitutional crisis will not be the same as yesterdays the crisis that we have just faced will inspire us to close the barn door now that the horse is departed but it is not enough to close the door through which one horse escaped we must instead examine the barn and close every window and every door and make sure that the walls are structurally sound we must identify as many possible constitutionally undefined areas and address those areas long before they become sources of major partisan controversy we must imagine all the problems that we can and not scoff at those who would solve imaginary problems the first of these issues that i would like to address is one that has not been discussed i believe on this floor for at least a decade and that is the issue of presidential succession we all know that if the president is impaired or becomes deceased the vice president succeeds to that office we all know that a vice president who then becomes president can appoint a successor to the vice presidential office we all know if things go smoothly there will always be a president and a vice president and a vice president ready to take over if the president god forbid is deceased but there could come times when we go for months or years without a vice president we did when gerald ford became president after the resignation of richard nixon one could have imagined the crisis we might have faced had president ford faced some untoward calamity see we have laws that provide for succession to the presidency such laws ought to provide two things certainty and continuity the present statute does provide certainty for if there is a vacancy in both the presidency and the vice presidency the next person in line is the speaker of the house and then the president pro tempore of the senate followed by the various cabinet officials in order of the seniority of their departments that will providefor certainty as to who holds the office of president but it is not enough for us to have certainty we also need continuity and by this i mean continuity of policy if for example the vice president has become president and there is a vacancy in the vice presidency the stock markets should know that if that vice president who has become president were to die that our national policies would remain pretty much the same that our economic policies would remain the same our adversaries and our friends around the world should know that even if there is no one currently serving as vice president that the next person in line will carry on pretty much the same policies no one should have any belief that a change in who is president except at a national election could radically change our policy most important it is key that any potential assassin not believe that they can radically change americas foreign or domestic policies with a bullet they can change the person but hopefully not radically change the policies unfortunately our present statute does not meet that standard of providing for continuity continuity of policy because the person in line after the vice president may or may not be of the same party our old system was i think superior the statute until a couple of decades ago provided that if there was a vacancy in both the president and the vice president the next person in line was the secretary of state and i believe after that the secretary of the treasury individuals who had been confirmed by the senate individuals of high integrity and very substantial governmenta l responsibility individuals though most importantly who would share a general philosophy with the president of the united states today we have a very different system a system where we could have a change in the party in the white house not as a result of an election but just as a result of succession one could have imagined in the 1970s with gerald ford serving as president that the country would wonder what if something happened to president ford would that mean that we would pull out of vietnam who knows no one should have doubted during that time but anyone looking at the constitution and our statutes would have doubted that a change in the person of the president would change the policies of the presidency now i should point out that we changed our statute several decades ago because it was believed that the first four persons in line to succeed to the presidency should be elected officials i do not find that incredibly compelling but i can understand why others do so let us maintain that policy should others think it important but let us provide that every president may file with the clerk of the house and the clerk of the senate an official document indicating who shall be third and fourth in line in succession that they would designate that the person third in line would either be the speaker of the house or the minority leader of the house and the person fourth in line would either be the majority leader in the senate or the minority leader in the senate under those circumstances we would know that a member of congress would be third and a member of congress would be fourth in line then no matter what is likely to happen an elected official held in high esteem by their colleagues in the congress would serve as third and fourth in line at the same time we would know that the party in the white house is not subject to change except through election if we fail to do so then some time in the next century we will face months if not years when our allies and enemies around the world wonder whether there could be a radical change in our policies due only to a sad death or incapacity assassins or potential assassins may be inspired to their evil deed by the belief that they are not only committing a heinous act against this country but in the misbegotten belief that that is an appropriate way to change radically americas foreign or domestic policy we have not addressed this issue i believe for decades we ought to let us move on though to another issue that is also important and that is one that has been discussed at great length and that is the need for voting machines around this country or vote tabulation systems that are worthy of the 21st century and worthy of the worlds most powerful democracy there have been several bills introduced that provide for at least a study of what can be done to improve our vote tabulation system but let me describe how important that is thirtyone percent of this country uses the punch card system which we became all too aware of in southern florida that system is used for example in los angeles and ventura counties major counties which i partially represent one out of every 66 persons voting for president in florida in a punch card county had their vote unregistered for president an undervote now you may say perhaps 1 out of every 66 floridians did not care to register a vote for president but in the adjoining counties where optical scanners are used only 1 out of every 250 voters chose to skip that office we know from our own experience that the vast majority of people who go to the polls at a presidential election cast a vote for president especially when they are given not only the two major choices but several other choices besides in fact experience in florida shows that it is not the case that there are just certain counties in florida where people want to skip the office of president because several counties have moved from one vote casting system to the other from 1996 to the year 2000 when they did so they went from roughly 1 out of every 66 ballots missing a vote for president to 1 out of every 250 so we see that the tendency to vote for president when accurately tabulated using the best machines available that 249 out of 250 people cast a vote that squares with our experience and that in fact the vote tabulating machines used in punch card counties are ignoring almost 1 percent of the votes cast for president this needs to be changed and we need to do more than just have a bandaid yes we could provide federal funds on a pilot basis to a dozen counties around the country we could provide 50 million or 70 million we could stand in front of a few fancy machines in a few counties but 31 percent of all americans are using this punch card system other americans are using equally bad systems and 1 percent of that 31 percent are being disenfranchised that is wrong we should provide 1 billion a year for several years real money for a real problem because there are 180 000 precincts in this country and each one has half a dozen or more voting booths with tabulation devices every county has to be able to count the ballots this is a big deal and cannot be dealt with by a few pilot programs that solve the problem in just a few counties what we ought to do is provide grants to counties and other local jurisdictions responsible for elections grants of between 50 percent and 80 percent of the cost of new vote tabulation and vote casting machinery and the cost of implementing the systems and training the employees involved what we ought to do is commission the federal election commission with the responsibility of identifying one two or three of the best vote tabulation systems for large counties perhaps a different list of one two or three systems for mediumsized counties and perhaps a different list of the best systems to be used in small counties then we should turn to every county in america that does not have one of these good systems and offer between 50 and 80 percent of the cost of buying the new equipment to do otherwise is to say that democracy is worth a quarter trillion dollars a year to defend from foreign threats but not even a tiny tiny portion of that to defend from constitutional crisis from unintentional disenfranchisement furthermore the supreme court whether one agrees with it or not has just enumerated or identified an equal protection right forn votes to be counted accurately now it is possible that this court will never find another circumstance in which to apply that new constitutional right it is possible that this court found that new right to apply it only to this election and now will want to seal it and never use it again but that is just this court one can imagine a court inspired by more liberal values that would rely on this case to question or invalidate elections from coast to coast if there was a denial of equal protection of the right to cast ones vote in a way in which it would be accurately counted the fact is these old vote tabulation systems are found often and to a greater extent and a greater proportion in urban counties with previously disenfranchised minorities disadvantaged minorities using systems that throw out 1 percent of their vote while adjoining more economically upscale counties use new upscale vote tabulation systems i am not sure this court would use the equal protection clause to deal with that issue but i do know that in other courts in other decades this issue may rise to the level of constitutional scrutiny and at that point at that point we may face another constitutional crisis as some other court examines whether it is fair to use accurate systems in upscale counties and decrepit systems for those who are poor and those in traditionally discriminated against racial minorities i also though want to point out another issue and that is if we do have a federal right an equal protection right to accurate voting that we establish some rules that require that those rights be raised on a timely basis i cite the butterfly ballot now famous from palm beach county certainly we ought to have a rule that says that that ballot needs to be challenged 30 days before the election or 3 days after itis known or should be known to the candidates involved in the election so that we do not have a federal court invalidating an election weeks or months afterwards because it finds that the butterfly ballot denies equal protection to those who use it we must have a system that puts the onus on candidates to bring to the attention their objections first to county election officials and then if they feel they have a constitutional claim to the federal courts the butterfly ballot should have been objected to long ago long before the election let me turn to a third issue and one that has also gotten some attention and that is the electoral college system when the electoral college was first instituted democracy was a newfangled dangerous idea that our founding fathers did not want to fully embrace but which other modern countries have more fully embraced than we have because it is now a proven idea and american values require that the president of the united states be elected by the people now the values of the 1700s may have been different but until recently virtually no american could have conceived of the idea was even aware of the existence of the electoral college secondly mr speaker i would point out that at the time our constitution was signed the states really were independent countries when they were independent countries we used the following terminology we would say the united states are going to do something today we say the united states is going to do something because we are now one nation with one president that presides over one people we are both a republic and a democracy the distinction between a democracy and a republic is now i believe outmoded because we are a republic that should be guided by democratic values particularly in the selection of a president now in this election the person who will be in the white house did not get a plurality of the votes but that was by a mere 300 000 to 400 000 votes imagine if by 1 million votes or 2 million votes or perhaps 3 4 or 5 million votes one person is installed in the white house while the other won the popular vote would that president have all of the legitimacy that we would like the president to have what is worse what happens if there is a tie i know we just lived through one crisis but what if ralph nader had won florida not this election maybe next election if that would have occurred then none of the presidential candidates would have had 270 electoral college votes and the presidency would have been decided here in the house of representatives so far that sounds reasonably fair but we in this house would vote by states north dakota and south dakota would have as much influence as new york and california combined would the country really accept a president who had been chosen by a majority of the states representing only a fraction of the nations population i think such a president might have been accepted in the 1700s in fact that is how thomas jefferson was selected but i am not at all sure that a president selected through such a manner would have legitimacy today finally the maintenance of the electoral college means that there could just be a few dozen votes in one state that could decide an election and could be the subject of a recount or more than one recount the solution is clear we ought to elect a president by national vote but one issue then arises what if no presidential candidate receives 50 percent of the vote i suggest that we draw the line at 40 percent since throughout the last hundred years every president we have installed i believe has received 40 percent of the popular vote yet in contrast no president in the last 12 years has received over 50 percent of the vote but if we had a situation with three four or five viable candidates for president and none of them got over 40 percent of the vote then i would suggest a national runoff for those who disagree with the cost of such an enterprise even in those incredibly rare occasions when a leading candidate failed to receive even 40 percent then perhaps the house of representatives could select the president with each member of the house having an equal vote we may not abolish the electoral college but if we do not it is time for us to stop playing with the excitement of wondering if we will have faithless electors now i am confident on december 18 we will not have faithless electors that every elector will cast their vote for the slate to which they are pledged but just because it does not happen next week does not mean we can sleep and wait for when it does happen there have been faithless electors in the past if we cannot agree to abolish the electoral college let us at least abolish electoral college members and use a point system that is automatic if we like the pageantry then we could have electoral college members but their votes should be tabulated for the candidate to which they are pledged unless that candidate releases them by a formal notarized document if we do otherwise then we will take a breath we will relax on december 18 when faithless electors do not control the outcome of the presidency and we will leave it to our children and grandchildren to experience the constitutional crisis that we could prevent today by eliminating the risk of faithless electors now there is another issue i would like to discuss and that is the statutory interpretation it is by no means clear whether this is the law of the land but it is the belief of some that a candidate for president cannot tell the people of the country who would serve in his or her cabinet there is discussion that our various antibribery statutes et cetera indicate that no candidate for office can indicate who will get an appointment should he or she be successful now i agree we should not be selling appointments and that would never be legal but we should certainly clarify the law so that if a presidential candidate chose to announce who would serve in this or that position and announced it publicly that the country would take that into consideration no candidate should risk the violation of federal law one could even postulate the idea of a criminal conviction just for telling us what some of us want to know now as a politically involved individual i would advise most presidential candidates not to tell us who they would appoint to the cabinets but any presidential candidate who chose to do so should not face any retribution now the next time bomb which we have not bothered to listen to is the method of amending our constitution by holding a constitutional convention we have never amended our constitution that way and so we have tremendous questions as to how such a constitutional convention would work the last time congress dealt with this i believe was in the 102nd congress when there was a constitutional convention implementation act introduced but basically ignored by the house and the senate here are a few of the issues let me cite article 5 of our constitution first of all which says that with the application of the legislatures of twothirds of the states there shall be a convention for proposing amendments to the constitution which would then have to be ratified by the legislatures in threequarters of the states in fact quite a number of states at times in the past sometimes 50 or 100 years in the past have passed the necessary resolution to call for a constitutional convention usually they have called for a constitutional convention to deal with this or that problem some states have called for constitutional conventions to deal with a balanced budget amendment or with term limits but if a constitutional convention were called or purportedly called perhaps called in the opinion of some and not called in the opinion of others the congressional research service outlines quite a number of questions that have not been settled for example on question yet to be settled is whether or not the petitions to call that convention must all be the same document or whether some can call for a convention to deal with term limits and others a convention to deal with balancing the budget and a bunch of others calling for a convention to completely revise the constitution what are the scope and limitations of any such constitutional convention once assembled for example assembled for the purpose of passing term limitations is the convention free to propose to the several states the complete revision of our constitution what is the validity of any rescission of a petition by a state legislature if a legislature called for a constitutional convention to deal with the adverse consequences of prohibition and passed that resolution in the first half of the last century is that state one counted toward the calling of a constitutional convention included in the tally of modern states that have called for a constitutional convention to deal with such modern concepts as term limits do state petitions have to be contemporaneous another unsettled issue there are many others and yet our entire constitution could be revised from the beginning through the most recent amendment by a constitutional convention which may or may not be legitimate because it may or may not conform on one of these issues it is time for congress to either abolish the entire concept of a constitutional convention or at least clarify how it would be called and what would be the scope of its powers i might add that perhaps we should move to a system where congress can propose or state legislatures can propose amendments to our constitution either twothirds of both houses of congress or twothirds of the state legislatures who could then see that amendment approved at a referendum by twothirds of the people of the country it may be time to look to the referendum as a way to ratify amendments to our constitution those are at least issues that we should talk about as much as we talk about the issues that pit republicans against democrats we should deal at length with the structure of our democracy we also of course should deal with campaign finance reform and then we should deal with an issue put before us by the supreme court decision in jones v clinton you will remember that that is the decision in which the court decided that anyone could sue the president for any reason that the lawsuit would go forward the president could be deposed and fortunately in the last 4 years only one party only one individual has sued the president it had very significant consequences i would cite the house to the last paragraph of the supreme courts decision where it says if congress depms it appropriate to afford the president stronger protection it may respond with appropriate legislation we ought to take the court up on that and here is why anyone with sufficient financing could sue the incoming president and we could have dozens and dozens of lawsuits financed by people who simply are angry with presidentelect bush or thenpresident bush slander lawsuits sexual harassment lawsuits job discrimination lawsuits federal lawsuits state lawsuits could 10 million be raised from highly partisan democrats for the purpose of financing dozens of lawsuits resulting in dozens and dozens of depositions of the incoming president perhaps i do not want to find out and even if that is not the state to which our country has yet sunk in levels of partisanship do we want to wait a decade or two or three until there is an organized effort to sue whoever is then president as many times as possible and take as many depositions as possible on as many salacious topics as possible i suggest instead that we indicate that any lawsuit against the president is suspended that the statute of limitations is told that the rights of the plaintiffs are preserved until that presidency is completed and that any depositions necessary to preserve evidence any documents that are necessary to be preserved are preserved so that trial can go forward after the defendant in that lawsuit leaves the white house to do otherwise is to invite antipresidential retribution by lawsuits there is another issue that i hesitate to bring before the house but one that we might be able to deal with and that is the ongoing investigation begun by kenneth starr most of this country knows that we have failed toreauthorize that we have squelched the independent counsel statute much of the country does not know that the independent counsels office of ken starr continues to operate and is allowed to continue to operate as long as it wishes to or until we in this congress by statute pull the plug padlock the office and send the files to the justice department now we have a particular reason to do so the justice department on january 21 will be in republican hands and if there is anything in those files which even a republican administration using reasonable discretion determines to prosecute they are free to do so but we allowed the independent counsel statute to expire because we know that it does not operate with discretion that an office that exists only to prosecute one individual and it is terminated if it fails to prosecute will find some reason to prosecute at least find some reason to continue to investigate and if you think that partisan tensions are now as high in washington as they could ever be imagine how this country will react if a republican congress allows to continue the ken starr investigation will we just be viewed as another pakistan another troubled democracy or an occasional democracy if we begin the process of indicting our former presidents i suggest that the continued failure of this congress to act the continued allowance of this congress to fund robert rays operation has the seeds for raising partisanship to one unnecessary level we have heard as much as we need to about monica lewinsky and federal dollars should no longer be spent to fi nance an office that has nothing to do that loses its power that loses its payment as soon as they decide that the lewinsky matter is no longer worthy of investigation i have brought up bipartisanship quite a number of times in this presentation let me just take a minute to talk about what i think bipartisanship means bipartisanship when it comes to legislation means working together to obtain bills that have substantial support on both sides of the aisle working with the leadership and the mainstream members on both sides of the aisle to put together bills that solve problems for america alternatively it could mean working through the committee process and should mean working through the committee process on bills that obtain the support of the ranking member and the chairperson of the subcommittee that is relevant and or the committee that is relevant or obtain substantial support from democrats and republicans on the relevant committee my fear is that we will deal with bipartisanship by finding a bill that is purely partisan and then reaching out to one or two members of the other party and saying a bill that is 99 and threequarters percent republican and onetenth of one percent democrat is a bipartisan bill that would be a betrayal of the consents of bipartisanship i commend presidentelect bush for reaching out to democrats to appoint to his administration just as president clinton has appointed a republican who now serves as secretary of defense but it would be a bitter form of bipartisanship if the appointment process was used cynically to appoint a sitting unitedstates senator that is a democrat not to bring bipartisanship to the administration but to change the partisan makeup of the united states senate there are many retired democratic unitedstates senators and house members that would make excellent members of presidentelect bushs cabinet he should not use bipartisanship as a tool for partisanship as a device cynically used to appoint and thereby alter the effects of the congressional election i thank you for your indulgence i thank you for the hours that we have spent together in this hall from time to time i thank you for your indulgence and i thank the house for giving me the opportunity to be the last to address the 106th congress i know that when we return we will reach across the aisle to begin solving the problems of america and i hope that that process is aided by focusing on those problems as to which there is no democratic or republican view"], [0.001247406005859375, 0.9987525939941406, 1, "several of the previous speakers have mentioned education and todays agenda in the congress focused primarily on education we had before us the bill which is commonly known as the edflex bill h r 800 and the rule for that bill allowed for only 5 hours of debate we need some additional time to discuss it why when the american people have stated that education is one of the highest priorities do we have only 5 hours in the united states congress to discuss an important education bill it must be important if it is the first bill that the majority has seen fit to bring to the floor it is important to them it is an important proposal that they are making some of us contend that what they are doing should not be done in this fashion that we should have this particular proposal about flexibility considered at the time of the reauthorization of the elementary and secondary education assistance act we reauthorize the elementary and secondary education assistance act every 5 years and it is up for reauthorization this year so if we are doing that why not consider these very important components of that bill all at once they are taking a part of the bill a part of the funds that go into that bill related to title i and proposing that a greater portion of it be used in an experiment which grants greater flexibility to the states and localities as to how they spend the money they are rushing to do that already it is suspect that kind of action why are we being stampeded into a consideration of one particular aspect of the elementary and secondary education assistance act what is the hurry why if we are going to treat education as an emergency why not bring the entire elementary and secondary education assistance act to the floor earlier this year instead of waiting until later why not bring it all together instead of balkanizing it fragmentizing it as the republican majority expects to do the education emergency faced in this country deserves a serious response from congress the emergency is real and we should go forward in a very serious way to deal with that emergency one of the things we should do is to listen to what my republican colleagues were saying a few minutes ago that the money that is in the federal treasury does not belong to the federal government it does not belong to the congress it does not belong to the white house it belongs to the people it is the taxpayers money all taxes are local tip oneill used to say all politics are local well all taxes are local they come from the pockets of all taxpayers the biggest tax of course is the income tax it is not only local it is right into the family right into the individuals pocket it is taxpayers money if it is taxpayers money why can wei not match the money up with the priorities the public has set in poll after poll we keep hearing that after social security education is the number one priority there was a time when education was just one of the top five there were other things that people wanted done crime was a big concern and it competed with education as one of those top priorities but it is clear now in all the polls that education is the number one priority after taking care of social security if education is the number one priority then the proposals that the president has made in his budget that he submitted to congress ought to reflect that priority the proposals that the republican majority is making ought to reflect the concern of the public we all look at the same kinds of polls we had a democratic retreat we went away and we spent days and a large part of the time was examining polls public opinion polls and studies of the voters attitudes i am certain that in the republican caucus retreat they did the same thing there is going to be a bipartisan retreat next week they will probably spend some time with some polls also the polls repeatedly say the same thing pollsters are very good they take a very scientific approach to things and they do a basically good job they all come up with the same answers that clearly education is the number one priority of the american people the american voters why do we not respond i do notthink a single poll has shown that one of the top priorities for consideration by the american voters is defense the american voters may be concerned about defense as they should be but it is not one of their top priorities it is nowhere near education as a priority there are a lot of other things that take priority over defense the common sense of the american people is amazing while we stumble around and make problems and create needs to expend greater amounts of money on defense here in washington they clearly see that we have other priorities that ought to be taken care of they see that there is no more cold war there is no more nuclear threat from another superpower they clearly see that we have the most modernized armed forces anywhere in the world they clearly see we are big enough to handle most real threats to our national security so they have the common sense the peoples wisdom to say look education is what we are concerned about they may even be far ahead of the military strategists because they recognize what military strategists know when questioned closely that more than a need for weapon systems more than a need for additional military hardware we have a need for manpower capable of operating the modern weapon systems that we have now we have systems that are very complicated we have systems that require people men and women who have some training some knowledge of how to deal with this digitalized cyber world that we are living in i have cited several times the fact that the navy floated a super aircraft carrier recently state of the art in aircraft carriers stateoftheart in every respect and for that reason they had a shortage of personnel they were 300 personnel short of the necessary number of people needed to man that aircraft carrier why were they short are there not plenty of young people who want to go to sea are there not plenty of young people in america men and women who would like to be in the navy yes there are but they want people with a certain kind of training and aptitude people who have been developed to the point where they can learn how to operate very sophisticated weapons systems very sophisticated energy systems that aircraft carrier is probably loaded with systems that many of us would consider systems of the future kinds of things that we do not see every day they need young people who are already trained to the point where they can easily pick up and be trained specifically for the duties required in that piece of sophisticated floating city with a lot of sophisticated operational systems that deserve the very best in general our military is complaining about a lack of manpower that they are short of people well they are short of people because they are not willing to take anybody off the street they need young people who have some kind of training some kind of prerequisite preparations that allow them to see that they can train these people to run the systems that we have so wherever you look in the military the answer is in education a greater need to train young people so that they can deal with the systems that are necessary to make us secure education should be the numberone concern of people who care about our defense and of course our economy it is obvious that our economy has moved into a high tech economy and that we are almost standing alone in this global economy with sophistication in terms of the operation of a cyberworld for business and it is likely to increase that we are going to have to carry that load the japanese the second or third largest economy in the world is way behind this country now in terms of digitalized systems in the business world and there is probably no other country or area that is going to catch up with us in europe they are still far behind in terms of the kind of computerized and digitalized systems that are going to carry us forward into the future we are going to be the leaders in the world for a long time if we are able to man it the science is there the technology is there but where is the manpower where are the personnel how much longer are we going to have to rely on india and other countries to bring over or send over here the information technology workers how much can they fill for us how much longer are we going to ship contracts over to places like bangalore india and have the income absorbed by people there that ought to be going into our wage structure here so that the workers who get those jobs in information technology can pay into the social security fund we are going in a circle even social security would be greatly benefited if we were to focus more on investing in education the primary problem with social security is that we see that the wage earners paying into social security in the future is going to decline in proportion to the number of people who are retired and need to be paid out of the social security fund a very simple problem very complicated answers are being offered one of the answers is that we must keep a wageearning population out there that pays as much as possible it may not be the only answer some other source of funding is going to have to be found probably i think a social security tax on unearned income would be one of those ways that we should seek more revenue to put into the social security fund but i am not going to talk about that in detail here the numberone source of revenue for the social security fund for a long time will be the wage earner we need more wage earners earning the wages in the high tech areas we do not need foreigners absorbing that portion of our economy we do not need overseas contractors absorbing great amounts of money that ought to be going into the economy to pay the wage earners who pay into social security so education becomes the numberone issue even if you look at it from the point of view of the military or the economy it just again shows the tremendous wisdom of the american people tremendous wisdom they understand what it is hard for us to understand or respond to here in congress what kind of response have we gotten we have the edflex bill that is on the floor now we dealt with two amendments today we are going to move forward and finish the final hour of discussion tomorrow i think at least 3 3 most of those hours are gone the question everybody who is listening out there ought to put to their tongressperson is why do we only have 5 hours to discuss the first education bill on the floor i mean why only 5 hours this bill is not just a simple adjustment to the existing elementary and secondary education assistance act it is not a simple adjustment it is not a little amendment that is going to make things move faster we are taking an experiment which involved 12 states and most of those states failed in that experiment according to the general accounting office they did not do very well yet we are going to go and broaden the experiment and cover all 50 states in the process what we are doing and the reason the republican majority has put it on the floor and is pushing us into a stampede mode is they want to set a precedent they want to open the door for the block grant process they want block grants to be the way of the 106th congress what we are going to see is more and more talk of block granting giving the money in one block just take the money and give it to the states take the money and give it to the governors dollars to the governors they talk about dollars to the classrooms it is dollars to the governors the governors never get enough they want more and more the governors have welfare reform money falling out of all their pockets they have a great welfare reform windfall that they are supposed to spend on job training day care and other areas related to dealing with the welfare re form situation the recent surveys have shown that most of the states are not using the money properly the governors are just using that money to take care of needs that they consider their own special needs or pet needs they are not following the general mandate of law they are not going to do it why are they not going to do it i am not sure i know why they are not going to do it but here is the history of education funding the states and the localities have always had the premier responsibility for education they still do most of the funding for education comes from the states and the localities right now less than 10 percent of the funds for education elementary and secondary education is provided by the federal government i am being generous it is more like 7 or 8 percent only 7 or 8 percent is provided by the federal government if we are only providing 7 or 8 percent then we only have 7 or 8 percent of the control and the influence the other money is being provided by the states and they have always provided it and the localities the states and localities presently have responsibility for education they have always had responsibility for education we heard speeches today which were fantastic on the floor blaming the federal government for the state of education in america education is in a poor state they say because the federal government has saddled the states and localities with bureaucratic mandates paperwork they have interfered with innovation et cetera et cetera well what is happening with the 93 percent of the funds that are strictly state and local funds they have total flexibility total flexibility they have had flexibility since the dawning of this nation the constitution has never seized responsibility for education it has always been a state matter the states have that responsibility why did the federal government get involved in the first place the states were not doing a good job the states were not placing us in a position to be able to mount the kind of technological drive and scientific drive to keep up with the soviet union which is a backward country in many ways but scientifically they put the first sputnik into space and they showed that when they concentrate on a particular area they could go forward and leave us in the lurch leave us behind for a long time our policies were driven by the fact that we wanted to help improve education in order to create the kinds of minds and the kinds of body of expertise in this nation that would allow us to do the job we did that large amounts of federal aid went into the defense the national defense education act and later on lyndon johnson proposed the elementary and secondary education assistance act and other federal aid to education because the states were not able to do the job partially because the complexity of the world had run off and left the states that is only a small part of the problem the larger part of the problem is that the states have never shown great vision in terms of investing in their populations before world war ii they were not doing anything to help the total population just stay alive and healthy when world war h came along we had a lot of recruits that were unhealthy a great majority of the recruits and the people who were drafted were just unfit to fight and they had to be put in condition with special procedures in order to just be able to carry a rifle the states had neglected their populations to that point in basic matters like health care and providing decent nutritious food to eat the federal government understood that lesson and began to deal with health care and nutrition programs we have an act which provided for school lunches recognizing that th6 first thing the government can do for our young people is to make sure that the poorest youngsters get a decent meal at least once a day at school they also discovered at the time of sputnik that a nation like russia the soviet union had left us behind japan in terms of industrial development technological achievements there had left us behind so it has been clear that whatever the states have been doing for the last 300 years with respect to education is not enough just to keep up but also the states do not show any great compassion and humanity for their total populations large portions of state populations the people without power have always been left behind the poor whites certainly in the south the african americans in the far west and the west the hispanics anybody who belongs in a group that does not have power left out of power they have been consistently neglected and abandoned by the states that has been true historically and it is still true now the federal governments role was to step in and try to compensate for the fact that the states were not doing what they should be doing now we have a situation where the federal government has stepped in its role is still minor it is not a major player it is a minor partnership where they are only providing 7 to 8 percent of the funds leaving the states to take care of the other 93 percent and they are being accused the federal government is being accused of ruining the public education system in america we have a body of 435 people who are among the most talented people in america you do not get here without being talented in one way or another most of the members of congress have a great deal of vision maybe the vision does not see exactly what i see the liberals see one way and the conservatives see another but they have vision and they have a great deal of education they know how to use data it is a highly qualified body here the united states house of representatives and the senate also we have highly qualified leaders capable of doing great things but we have allowed ourselves to be driven into a corner where we are discussing really relative trivialities on education our first great debate is focused on a charge that the federal government must give more flexibility to the states for the small amounts of money that the federal government is supplying they must supply more flexibility for the states in order for us to improve education in america that is a hypothesis that has no support in fact it has no support in fact again the american people show they have more common sense than this talented body that we have here in the house of representatives more common sense common sense will tell you if you have 93 percent of the control you are at fault if it goes wrong whatever is happening with education in america that is wrong the states and localities must accept the blame for what the federal government has said is that we want to be partners we would like to supply some small amount of money we would like to supply some advice from a national perspective from an international perspective we are the only industrialized nation that leaves the greater proportion of the decisionmaking about education up to regions or states or localities most other nations have nationgl policies and national education administrations that have much more influence than we have we defer to the states the constitution does not give the federal government the responsibility for education and therefore it defers to the states and has done that traditionally so while we in 1999 in the 106th congress which has wasted a lot of times with matters that really were not that important but finally we have gotten moving why are we debating a bill which is based on the assumption that the problem in america in education is that the states need more flexibility the federal government is preventing the states from doing agood job that is totally erroneous the federal government is not the problem the federal government is begging to be a partner the federal government is taking certain initiatives to try to move the states beyond their inflexibility states are inflexible in their incompetence some states are inflexible in their corruption inflexible in their cronyism as my colleagues know state government is not a model of government in america they operate in areas where there are more shadows than there are in respect to the federal government i say that at every level of state government i was of government i served at every level i was a commissioner in new york city of an agency i was a state senator in new york state and now i serve here in the congress i have served at every level of government and i think that the level of government which needs the most light shined upon it the most exposure who should be held up mostly and examined and critiqued is state government state government is the inbetween they do not have a constituency like you have of the kind you have in city government where the constituency is real they are living they are breathing and they are right there and they are pushing for real responses from their government they do not have the kind of problem that the federal government has where the whole nation is looking at what we do here and the spotlight is on us and we are dealing with matters at a high policy level that are complicated and deserve a long and intense discussion and will be picked up on by the media will pick up on what we are doing and there are a number of reasons why we cannot operate in shadows here but state government operates in shadows in state governments and bureaucracies they do not have the pressure of a constituency so state government is the least efficient form of government least efficient area in government and it should not be klorified i have said that many times we should not be here wasting our time debating a bill which is focused primarily on removing federal involvement removing federal wisdom in my opinion what the federal government is doing is far superior to anything that most states have offered they do not want to be told you got to do systematic planning they do not want to be told you got to have real goals you cannot drop the burden of education totally on the backs of the students and say we are going to test them and kick them out of schools if they do not do well when they close down schools they do not do well what are you doing as a government to provide opportunities to learn they do not like that concept governors hate the concept the opportunity to learn because it is all related to the whole approach of necessary accountability everybody else is held accountable why cannot governors and local school boards be held accountable they do not want to deal with that they want the flexibility not to be accountable they want the flexibility of never being held responsible for systematic planning never to be questioned in theig arbitrary decisions about sex in personnel never to be questioned about the fact that they are always making new laws to put more burdens on the backs of students but they do not guarantee that students are going to have a safe place to study they do not guarantee the students are going to be able to have decent laboratories and equipment for science they do not guarantee the students have enough books they will not do the things that are necessary for education and they do not want the federal government to say well we think you ought to show us how you are going to do that before we give you more money on top of the money you already have it is all right to give the money back to the states and localities i began with the assumption it is our money give it back to us give it back to us for school construction give it back to us for whatever needs are identified by the people the people have identified education as a major need do not take our money and spend it on defense or spend it excessively somewhere else and neglect the requests we have made that you provide more federal assistance to education let me just conclude about todays edflex bill todays edflex bill h r 800 as my colleagues know there are many of my colleagues who have amendments to offer which are very useful amendments we had an amendment offered by the gentleman from california today which was very useful and would have made it possible for many more members to vote for the edflex bill if it had passed because it called for accountability it says if we are going to give the governors the states and localities more flexibility as to how they spend a portion of the title i funds that is what this is all about if you are going to do that then let us have an agreement that they are going to be held accountable in certain specific wags they refuse to accept that we are discussing that there are other amendments that my colleagues on the committee on education and the workforce the gentleman from new jersey the gentlewoman from hawaii the gentleman from virginia have to offer in order to improve the bill most of them are going to be rejected and many of them are never going to be considered because all we have is 5 hours to discuss this bill now you say why do you only have five hours we have a system of rules here that determine how every bill will be processed on the floor and the committee on rules at the request obviously of the leadership and the people on the majority party members on the committee on education and the workforce they decided to limit the debate to 5 hours it is as simple as that so if people want to change things right away why not you call your member of congress and ask why we are debating this important bill for only 5 hours but let me make my final comment by reading from the new york times editorial page today march 10 1999 the new york times had an excellent editorial and it says many of the things that the democratic members of the committee on education and the workforce education said at the time the bill was up for consideration in our committee and i will read the entire editorial and submit it also for the record so that it will be clearly known that all the parts are here and there will be no mistakes it is entitled a threat to impoverished schools this is a new york times editorial page of march 10 1999 and i quote the achievement gap between affluent and disadvantaged children is a challenge to american education and a threat to national prosperity unfortunately a bipartisan bill that is scheduled for debate and a vote today in congress could widen that gap by allowing states to use federal dollars targeted at the poorest students for other educational purposes the socalled edflex proposal could damage the poorest districts which have traditionally been underfinanced by the states and cities even though they bear the burden of teaching the least prepared students let me reread the last sentence from the new york times editorial the socalled edflex proposal could damage the poorest districts which have traditionally been underfinanced by the states and cities even though they bear the burden of teaching the least prepared students to continue reading the second paragraph of the editorial title i of the elementary and secondary education act was the federal governments way of assuring impoverished children a chance at the supplemental services they need to succeed title i money about 8 billion a year pays for special courses like remedial reading and math as well as services like counseling over all federal dollars make up only about 8 percent of the public school budgets but in the poorest schools in the deep rural south title i can account for more than a third of school spending the edflex proposal would allow states to apply for waivers to do what they wish in education with the poverty money on the premise that the states might use it more wisely than federal law allows the proponents of this process point to ongoing edflex experiments conducted under the clinton administration in 12 states but a report from the general accounting office suggests that the experiments have been sloppily handled and should not be duplicated without careful guidelines and performance criteria the gao found that of the 12 experimental states only texas had established clearlydefined goals for employing the waivers and laid out criteria for evaluating the experiment the edflex expansion being debated in congress would extend waivers even to states that have no intention of innovation and no means in place of evaluating what they do let me repeat what the new york times editorial of today march 10 says the edflex expansion being debated in congress would extend waivers even to states that have no intention of innovation and no means in place of evaluating what they do congressman george miller and i am continuing to read from the new york times editorial congressman george miller democrat of california and dale kildee democrat of michigan have proposed an amendment to the pla4 that would allow waivers only if the states employ serious assessment plans and commit themselves to closing the achievement gaps between disadvantaged students and their peers the wise thing to do would be to put edflex aside until later in the session when congress reauthorizes the entire elementary and secondary education act let me reread the last sentence the wise thing to do would be to put edflex aside until later in the session when congress reauthorizes the entire elementary and secondary education act but if congress insists on moving forward now to do so without the millerkildee amendment would be socially irresponsible the millerkildee amendment was defeated on the floor of the house today as a last act of congress i will enter this editorial in its entirety into the record from the new york times march 10 1999"], [0.0014520883560180664, 0.9985479116439819, 1, "i would like to address a number of issues that i think are very much related to the problem of racism of deadly differences and diversity problems that have broken out all over the world and we are part of trying to resolve a lot of them occur right here at home in my own city of new york a poll was taken that showed and the new york times announced today that onefourth of all new yorkers white and black new yorkers believe that the police of new york city behave quite differently with people of color with minority groups african americans hispanics and asians they behave quite differently with them than they do with whites whites as well as blacks have come to this conclusion onefourth of all the citizens of new york believe that this is the case so we have a serious problem right at home with a very crucial body of people the police who are so vital to the law and order of the city for everybody everybodys protection then we have farranging problems like those that are taking place in kosovo and yugoslavia where this government is spending large amounts of money we have spent about 9 billion to try to work through situations in yugoslavia which evolve out of racial and ethnic and religious differences whereas i was all in favor of course of extending the resources of this country into that situation i think that the yugoslavia situation is totally out of hand and 9 billion more than 9 billion is enough to invest our nation is an indispensable nation available and i think that is important to help with trouble spots anywhere in the world but we should not let ourselves get sucked into any trouble spot for so long that it absorbs an inordinate amount of resources and takes away the possibility of helping with other problems i think it was right that we went into haiti to help liberate haiti from people who had taken over from a duly elected democratic government i think it was important that we went into somalia i think it is important that the president has shown great concern and there are some resources now deployed in rwanda all of these situations rwanda somalia kosovo serbia bosnia northern ireland our president did not dispense large amounts of military aid in northern ireland but his own personal commitment there and the use of american diplomatic skills have helped to abate that situation but all over the country all over the world we have these conflicts based on differences and diversity they are probably going to go on for a long long time we have to learn how to live with them and to try to abate them and try to lessen them hopefully over the long period decades and centuries we can eliminate some of them first we have to understand how difficult it is and how deeply entrenched it is and how it is important that governmental resources be invested in the effort to lessen the amount of racism hate crimes ethnic rivalries that exist and might explode at any moment it is important it is important that we understand the need to deal first of all with those that are closest to us one of the closest conflicts and ongoing problems in america is racism related to the long history of african americans who were held in slavery for 232 years we do not like to think that 232 years of slavery had any consequences or that there is anything special about this particular group and their relationship with the rest of the americans just as we do not like to think there is any special relationship between the native americans and the rest of the american people that there should be any special consideration but surely there ought to be some special consideration about the relationship between the descendents of the native americans and the rest of the americans in view of the fact that history was quite brutal with respect to the native americans history was quite brutal with respect to african americans who are a group of people in this country in this hemisphere only because they were transported to this hemisphere against their will so i want to talk about all of these things in the news today there was also an account of a new effort to try to fight slavery in the sudan and slavery in mauritania we have some groups that are american based that are actually raising money to buy slaves from the sudanese the sudanese are practicing slavery in a very cruel and inhuman way even to this day they say it is all part of the civil war only the women and children of the enemy are captured and they have a right to take them and use them for bounty and whatever whatever the reason given it is still slavery in 1999 in sudan which is a country of people who are of dark hue one might say black a lot of black people whatever range of color they may have there is slavery there is slavery in mauritania arabs and people of an arab descent and african descent all in mauritania but in mauritania there are some black people who are still enslaved in 1999 i thought that was interesting that that appeared on the news today at the same time i heard on the news this morning and i listen usually to national public radio and there was some bad news about northern ireland a civil rights lawyer in northern ireland catholic civil rights activist lawyer was assassinated with a fire bomb a fire bomb blew up her car so we have reminders of many kinds of how these ethnic tensions religion in the case of ireland it is religion that has divided people it is very interesting how human beings seem to look for reasons for conflict they want to accentuate differences so we have people who are ethnically pretty much the same racially the same in northern ireland but the religious differences have set off a long time feud which is quite violent and bloody in somalia we could not understand what the problem was in somalia they were all most of the same religion same race there were no deep tribal divisions they all spoke the same language yet in somalia the human beings there found ways to accentuate some differences that was generally based on pure politics people having power ambitions in one area and organizing their own gang and over here they would organize another gang there were no tribes but they created tribes out of interests that were really power interests of course here is the crux of the problem most of the time these ethnic tensions racial tensions and divisions are accelerated and exacerbated by people who do want power demagogues who exploit the situation for power reasons we have 232 years of slavery in this nation because for economic reasons which also are power reasons for economic reasons it was beneficial to enslave a population and provide the free labor from one end of the country to the other it was mostly in the south the plantations there was a longterm need for free labor and large amounts of labor there but in new york large amounts of slaves were used to build the original city slavery was just as cruel there as it was anywhere else the third largest slave port of the country at one time was a new york slave port so all of these things still have their longterm fallout on history it would do well for us to pay more attention to history i applaud president clinton and his appointment of a commission on race relations to at least stimulate a set of discussions and dialogues among the american people about the issue of race and differences in relationships some people say it got out of hand and it was not very productive it only had a years life for whatever the problems were it was still a positive constructive action i hope the president will follow it up with further action but more importantly here is an area where i think foundations and philanthropists could make a contribution there are a lot of controversies that are inevitably associated with anything related to race relations the controversies could probably better be handled by the philanthropic sector and the kind of controversies they are they are not so much current but scholarly discussions and discussions of positions and attitudes and i think they ought to be handled more with foundations and other philanthropic organizations financing those areas than the government but the government should stimulate that discussion president clinton started the discussion and i think we ought to as a government follow up on that i think that the resolution of the gentleman from ohio that called for the government of america to apologize for slavery which aroused so much controversy and ill feeling across the country i think that is still a pertinent item of discussion i think it is a lightning rod that we should really discuss why should the american government not apologize for slavery when we are seeing the governments of japan and of germany and various other governments that exist now that were not really there the german government was not there when hitler was there but the present government has apologized in certain areas as well as the government of japan has apologized to the korean women who were forced into prostitution and to some others and other apologies are taking place the swiss government just apologized and set up a fund to the victims of greed the holocaust victims of greed where they put the money in swiss banks and the swiss banks used various maneuvers to keep those people from getting money so it is a discussion which carries civilization forward and a discussion of an american apology for slavery would do a great deal in thatdirection i think the south africans set an example for civilized nations of today and the future that should not be ignored the government of south africa today the new government of south africa today that took over just 4 years ago insisted that it would not seek justice it would seek reconciliation that was a very important and unprecedented move by a national government here is a government made up of a new majority the majority of the people about 40 million black africans in south africa had been oppressed for many decades by the white south africans the black majority took over in south africa the government was made up of a government elected by the people and most of the people in powerwere black instead of seeking justice which would have resulted in large numbers of trials executions and a whole lot of revengeseeking the south african government that took power proclaimed that it wanted reconciliation and no matter how horrible the crime was no matter how horrible the political crime was related to the politics of the long years of oppression and the fight against apartheid they would allow people to come forward and if they would tell the truth they would offer amnesty to those folks who told the truth more important than the individuals who came forward and the testimonies that took place and the whole unprecedented kind of activity that they developed is the spirit that that sent out throughout the whole country that we are not going to look at the past we are not going to live in the past to the point where it becomes a noose around the throat of the future and the present we are not going to seek justice to the point where it destroys the possibility for reconciliation and progress so reconciliation and this was a new idea to me i never thought of it that way before nelson mandela and the government of south africa today put it forward reconciliation is more important than justice reconciliation is more important than justice we hammered home this same theme when jean bertrand aristide was restored to his rightful place in haiti the government of the united states insisted that he also follow the same policy we made an official request that the aristide government not seek justice but instead emphasize reconciliation that whole approach of course is being carried out in bosnia and serbia and croatia we are paying billions for that too much in my opinion but we are leading the way to a proces of reconciliation which will provide for building for a future rather than justice i do not say justice is not important and i do not think human society can exist unless we have forms of punishment people must be punished and there must be an understanding that individuals will be held accountable for crimes i do not think anybody would ever say that hitler should have been treated the way some of the leaders of haiti were treated the united states government actually paid the rent leased the homes of the dictators in haiti that they deposed cedras and the other two who were at the top of the official terror apparatus in haiti were treated like princes and helped to get out of the place and given enough income to maintain themselves for a long time they are still out there alive and may come back that is a danger instead of justice it was important that they be moved from the scene peacefully in order to facilitate reconciliation now i do not think the nuremberg trials were wrong i do not think the trials of the japanese perpetrators of massive violence in asia the people who attacked pearl harbor i do not think it was wrong to punish them that is going quite far but it is something to consider this whole reconciliation process and in the case of the nations now that participate in reconciliation we are seeing a more positive result as a result of reconciliation being placed above justice but the south africans in the process of seeking reconciliation felt it was very important to have truth truth was a very important part of establishing reconciliation i think in america we have missed that point with respect to race relations and certainly relationships between the native americans and the rest of the american population and certainly with relationship between the african americans and the rest of the american population we have never admitted as a government that great crimes were done to the african americans who were enslaved and that the consequences of 232 years of slavery need to be studied the truth needs to be laid out and we need to take steps to combat some of those consequences a very interesting individual specific development is taking place which i think we ought to focus on as part of the way to get more truth thrown on the whole phenomenon of american slavery there is a controversy which is made for america because it is very individual it is very personal and it involves a love story it is the story of thomas jefferson and sally hernings sally hemings was a slave at monticello under thomas jefferson for many many years there has been a controversy about whether or not there was a relationship between sally hemings and thomas jefferson which produced some children four or five children the controversy is not about whether thomas jefferson might have had sex with sally hemings many slave owners had sex with their slaves and there are millions of mulattos that resulted from those unions to provide concrete evidence that many slave owners had sexual relationships with their slaves the problem with jefferson is that it appears that he had a longterm relationship with sally hemings that he treated her as if she was his common law wife for 38 years sally hemings was on the scene starting from the time that she went to paris as a nurse and maid for jeffersons youngest daughter to the time that jefferson died she was there all the time she was there in paris she could have gone free stayed in paris and been a free person she did not she came back to monticello she was in monticello during the whole time that jefferson was president and when he left the presidency she remained at monticello and she was there when he died there was a big public scandal related to the relationship between sally hemings and thomas jefferson a man named callendar who had been a socalled friend of jefferson jefferson had gotten him out of prison when john adams with his alien and sedition laws put large numbers of people in prison who were accused of treason on the basis of what they wrote and the criticisms they made of the government callendar was imprisoned and of course jefferson was against the alien and sedition laws and against the federalist dictatorship that was being generated once jefferson was elected as president callendar was set free callendar had written articles and done some things with jeffersons party and jefferson and callendar wanted to become a postmaster when jefferson would not make him a postmaster callendar turned on jefferson and went to monticello and got all the gossip together and he was the one who accused jefferson of having a mistress with children at monticello it became a big public scandal it was in newspapers from one part of the country to the other jefferson was ridiculed john quincy adams wrote a ballad making fun of him et cetera et cetera jefferson never admitted anything of course he never even commented but the relationship was not ended sally hemings was not sent away from monticello she remained there she remained there during his presidency and then after he went back she remained there and until his death as i have just said several times so sally hemings and thomas jefferson the questions remained a historian recently not so recently about 15 years ago documented the fact that jefferson was at monticello every time that sally hemings conceived children the period before the birth of her children he was at monticello at all those times they had other various things that they documented in his notations in his farm books et cetera which indicated that sally hemings was very much a presence at monticello there are certain letters of course and other kinds of things that are missing from jeffersons numerous writings that were also timed at a time when he had some kind of important relationship that might have had a record of some kind of relationship with sally hemings many of those letters are missing no documentation sally hemings is erased from history we do not have any photographs of her or any descriptions of her except the one or two from her son and from a man who had been a slave at monticello isaac jefferson so i will talk about the controversy that has now mounted to the point where so much documentation existed which confirmed the fact that there was a relationship between jefferson and hemings that a dna test was developed a scientist who happened to be residing at monticello carefully put together a dna test he secretly got permission from jefferson offspring known offspring of the jefferson family and he got permission and dna from the offspring of sally hemings and after putting it through a very rigorous set of tests the confirmation is that it is very probable the dna tests bear out the other kinds of documentation that jefferson was the father of sally hemings youngest child and therefore it makes all of the other evidence more credible i am going to quote from an article that i wrote on this whole matter and i think i will save some time and make the point that i am trying to make tonight better if i read from this article it is entitled kingpins for truth and reconciliation thomas and sally dna evidence confirming jeffersons relationship with sally hemings could open the door for a more profound dialogue on slavery and race relations if that strikes my colleagues as strange let me read it again dna evidence confirming jeffersons relationship with sally hemings could open the door for a more profound dialogue on slavery and race relations this portion of slavery that has never been discussed fully is related to the fact that there were intimate relations between the races from a power point of view it usually was the slave owners and the overseers and the people who had privileges and power who interacted with the female slaves but out of that is a set of truths that come concerning myths about inferiority myths about abilities to coexist a number of things which not only are documented and reinforced by the new evidence of jeffersons relationship with sally hemings but there have been several books written lately which i think also fall into this same pattern i am going to read first from my article to make things shorter i will read some excerpts from it only a few months after the release of the report of the advisory board of the presidents initiative on race and that report is entitled one america in the 21st century forging a new future a scientific report has confirmed the likelihood that president thomas jefferson was the father of the children of his slave and longtime companion sally hemings these two events can be constructively related let me repeat only a few months after the release of the report of the advisory board of the presidents initiative on race and the report is entitled one america in the 21st century forging a new future a scientific report has confirmed the likelihood that president thomas jefferson was the father of the children of his slave and longtime companion sally hemings these two events can be constructively related and again i want to point out that two new books have come out which talk about slave owners and their children by slaves and i read only the review of this i have not had a chance to read the book the review appeared in the washington post it is called the hairstons an american family in black and white published by st martins press and it talks about a family where slaves and slave owners and the personnel of the plantations were intermixed and it singles out one tragic story of one slave owner who decided that he loved his slave wife commonlaw wife some would call it a mistress or concubine i do not think he thought of it that way he loved her so much that he willed her daughter a large part of his property and there was a big fight to take that property away which succeeded of course and she was left in slavery but a very concrete tragedy there another book that recently came out is called slaves in the family the author of that one is edward ball slaves in the family by edward ball goes back and deals with a south carolina based huge plantation and a large family over several generations and he shows how the intermarriage and the mixtures came down to the present i think it is important another book that also talks about this in more general terms and had the advantage of being part of a public television series is africans in america africans in america brings out some very interesting facts that are little known about slavery and the freed men and the whole relationship with the general population etcetera so returning to my article thenew discussions of the life philosophy and politics of thomas jefferson might do more to facilitate an honest assessment of blackwhite relations in america than the report which is laden with facts the report is the one america in the 21st century that was put out by the initiative on race i thought it was an interesting report but as my colleagues can see from my remarks here i do not think it went nearly far enough but if we took the report together with the new facts together these two developments could greatly enhance our understanding of an extremely complex phenomena the weakness of the report of the presidents advisory board is that it is thorough about obvious kinds of things that we all know about but it lacks the vital ingredient of profundity the report is competent respectful universal in its coverage balanced and not at all an embarrassment to the white house however when the depth of the deliberations of that report are measured against the complexity of the mission and the intensity of the challenge the appropriate grade for this noble but feeble effort would be b or c our national dialogue would be greatly benefited by the establishment of several adequately financed commissions on group relations native americans certainly deserve their own separate historical documentation and analysis africanamericans require no less than an objective statement of history a thorough and comprehensive study as a basis for the unraveling of the many complexities of our present interaction with mainstream society contrary to the beliefs of many africanamericans as well as others current policymaking would be greatly enhanced by a worldclass study of american slavery and the thwarted reconstruction effort that followed the emancipation proclamation and the 13th 14th and 15th amendments such a study would be useful if it is done in the spirit of truth and reconciliation the noble embryo that the presidents initiative has planted should be allowed to sprout and grow using the bully pulpit of the white house the president should call on private foundations to finance such a worldclass project and he should recommend that the worlds top scholars and thinkers including nobel prize winners be recruited to provide research and editorial guidance for such a study one of the first items that should be placed on the research and analysis agenda is a controversial question of the relationship between thomas jefferson and sally hemings it would be a human interest case study offering great illuminations for american history it could also be an educational landmark love story that captures the attention of a mass audience and forces them to confront the institution of slavery in all of its dimensions the scientific validation of jeffersons paternity with respect to hemings children is a historical blockbuster dna evidence has exposed the fact that respected academicians and historians have promulgated or tolerated a dangerous and suffocating denial of certain selfevident truths about american slavery this same distortion process applies to too much of american history as it relates to slavery the civil war and reconstruction unlike the very civilized behavior of the new rulers of south africa the united states has never had a truth and reconciliation commission as part of a larger effort the story of thomas jefferson and sally hemings could provide a potent spark to generate a bonfire of new revelations which will increase the possibility of longterm improved blackwhite reconciliation most people would say that they do not see how any probing of such a relationship could lead to anything but more controversy more hostility and more antagonism between the races starting with the numerous africanamericans who want to throw thomas jefferson down from his throne because now it has been confirmed that he took advantage of a slave woman well i do not think the evidence confirms anything of the nature slave owners were in a position to take advantage of all their slaves that is true but the evidence with respect to thomas jefferson is that this particular woman he cared a great deal for he maintained her near him in monticello in the mansion for 38 years despite a scandal that normally would lead a politician to distance himself from such a person the story of thomas and sally may be summarized as follows while jefferson was serving as the american ambassador in paris sally hemings arrived as a maid for his younger daughter who sailed from virginia to join her father jefferson seduced her and the pregnant sally returned to america only after he promised that all of her children would be set free under french law she could have remained a free person in france during the first year of his presidency a journalist exposed the fact that jefferson had a slave mistress who was the mother of his children the third president of the united states refused to answer this charge he also never removed sally hemings from monticello they were together for 38 years at monticello until jefferson died three of their children were allowed to run jefferson noted in his farm books and his accounts that whenever one of the hemings children left the plantation they really were set free with his consent he would just note in his book that they were allowed to run because to set them free required certain kinds of filing of papers and in virginia once you were set free you had a limited amount of time to get out of the state there were complications so they were just allowed to run and the notations were made nevertheless these same children who were allowed to run always ended up in urban settings where they got new footing and it was assumed that jefferson and his friends had helped to establish his children in those new settings to enable them to thrive two of the children were set free in jeffersons will with the dna testing confirming jefferson paternity the journey so competently and eloquently begun by fawn brodie with her best selling book entitled thomas jefferson an intimate history has now reached its peak that is more than 15 years ago that fawn brodie who was a professor at one of california universities wrote a book called thomas jefferson an intimate history the book was denounced by the regional daughters of virginia and a number of other historical groups denounced fawn brodie but her set of facts her documentation was used to set in motion a process that has continued to today and finally we have the dna testing despite vicious criticisms from the establishment historians still prolonging the confederate view of american history brodies scholarship propelled the search for truth forward while the relationship between jefferson and hemings was not her primary preoccupation brodie provided this story with a rightful proportion of the space and she integrated the story of sally hemings with the rest of her narrative brodies thorough account of jefferson as a failing businessman on the brink of bankruptcy alongside the documentation of the continuous presentation of sally hemings may both raise and answer an obvious question why didnt jefferson marry a wealthy widow or a daughter of a wealthy person to end his financial woes i repeat brodies thorough account of jefferson as a failing businessman on the brink of bankruptcy alongside the documentation of the continuous presence of sally hemings may both raise and answer an obvious question why didnt jefferson matter a wealthy widow or the daughter of a wealthy person to end his financial woes with an eye more focused and operating from a courtroom point of view a more recent book by annette gordonbennett updates the work of brodie and with her remarkable presentation of the evidence has stimulated the more recent debates which has helped produce the dna testing now all sides must respond to the scientific evidence in her book thomas jefferson and sally hemings an american controversy gordonbennett goes on to indict the establishment historians for their gross neglect of vital records barbara chaseriboud in the novel entitled sally hemings which waswritten based on facts related in fawn brodies nonfiction work the novel by barbara chaseriboud offers a uniquely constructed and very ambitious fictional account to interpret the relationship between thomas jefferson and sally hemings her point of view repeatedly emerges crystal clear throughout the novel although her writing is often laborious and strained she sometimes reaches dramatic heights in her depictions of emotions of her imagined victimsof jeffersons patriarchal and slaveowning powers chaseriboud is able fictionally to occupy the bodies not souls of sally and her children and from within them she confronts what she imagines to be the cold blue insensitive eyes of the master of monticello chaseriboud depicts jefferson as a patronizing antiwoman cruel oppressor from this novelist jefferson is a white southern aristocrat trapped within the personality parameters of his class and his time that is her point of view he is also a male chauvinist pig who raped and ruined a young slave girl who is left with no alternative except to love him to death chaseriboud forces sally to become a drug to afflict the addict jefferson til death parts them the merits of jeffersons public achievements and historic accomplishments can never offset his intimate behavior flaws in the opinion of barbara chaseriboud who is a female story teller of african descent each day since the new dna discovery i read or hear the same kind of intense condemnations of jefferson although they are usually more blunt and crude and they lack the redeeming eloquence of barbara chaseriboud i hear them from africanamerican females who want to dismiss jefferson and forget about the fact that jefferson was a precursor to lincoln and the whole idealistic bold advance of jefferson made it possible to create an america which would later emancipate its slaves i am compelled personally to register intense disagreement with chaseriboud and all those others who want to knock jefferson off his pedestal for that reason there are people on the other side the conservatives and the confederates who want to dismiss jefferson now because if he did have a serious relationship with a slave then he does not deserve to remain in their pantheon but let me deal with those who are african american who refuse to accept jefferson for what he really is and what he did contribute both to america and to the emancipation of the slaves any interpretation of the thomas jefferson and sally hemings relationship that discounts or trivializes jefferson as an idealist a visionary an intellectual a pragmatic statesman and a crafty machiavellian politician is not acceptable in my view he was an idealist and his ideals are still very important to what happened the sequence of events that took place in america even those that led to the emancipation proclamation the fact that such a giant as thomas jefferson chose to keep sally hemings at his side for 38 years opens the door to a myriad of magnificent questions does the length of the relationship despite the inconvenience caused by public exposure and scandal clearly show that it was not a lust but a love relationship if he did not love sally hemings then why did he not just keep her as a concubine while he married a woman of wealth to solve his ever present financial problems would a confirmation of his deep love for sally hemings not also clarify a number of the other riddles and contradictions which are related to this socalled sphinx the last great book on jefferson was called the sphinx the same youthful jefferson who wrote the declaration of independence with an original draft that condemned slavery also set forth a racist platform in the book called notes on the state of virginia i repeat the same youthful jefferson who wrote the declaration of independence with an original draft that condemned slavery also set forth a racist platform in notes on the state of virginia as a young congressman however jefferson led the fight to stop the spread of slavery into the new states he led the fight to stop the spread of slavery and he lost that by one vote by the way he lost that bill by one vote he stated that slaves had a limited capacity for learning nevertheless jefferson urged at one time that slaves should be educated and then set free in the oppressive social and political environment of virginia why did jefferson speak out of both sides of his mouth why were there contradictions why did jefferson not just settle down comfortably as a pure acknowledged slave owner and racist in his philosophical restlessness and his discontent with his own public positions one can find the wellsprings of jeffersons greatness the politician in his pronouncements surrendered to his peers while privately he subscribed to greater truths his love for sally was probably a constant internal irritant this lifelong reverence for his chambermaid is also a vital and legitimate clue to what he personally believed with respect to the equality of the races i said that jefferson was an idealist he was a visionary he was an intellectual but he was also a pragmatic statesman and a crafty machiavellian politician jefferson founded the first political party in america jefferson united with a guy called aaron burr who most people did not trust to form the first political party in america aaron burr true to his reputation later betrayed jefferson but that was necessary to get an opposition party going to the federalists jefferson pretended he was not interested in being elected president while he was plotting all the time to become president and successfully managed to become president jefferson was a politician and i do not find the fact that he made contradictory statements to be a great puzzle he is not a sphinx to me politicians do make contradictory statements all the time unfortunately that happens and we say it is in order to achieve some more noble goal that we distort the truth or we do not tell what we really think but jefferson was not only a politician he was a southern politician he was rooted in the plantation culture of virginia consider all that and consider the fact that he still led the fight on the floor of the house of representatives to stop the spread of slavery into the other states in the virginia environment where slavery escalated downward into an ever more savage and criminal institution did jeffersons attachment to sally and her children keep the embers of his antislavery sentiments burning if there was some way that we could miraculously recover the missing letters of jefferson would we find corrections of his most racist utterings would we find apologies to sally hemings would we find expressions of his great love for sally in his own insightful words jefferson while he was president also later narrowly fought for and narrowly passed the legislation which ended the importation of slaves into the country that was very difficult it took his soninlaw randolph his soninlaw randolph had to help him a great deal to pass that legislation it is probable that the recent dna clarification will generate more than new scholarly debates among academicians more fictional interpretations in poetry and novels and drama are inevitable in the quest to fill in the gaps of a tale that is about both love and power i think that the accounts of thomas jefferson and sally hemings the story of thomas jefferson and sally hemings the history of thomas jefferson and sally hemings is now at the point where it is a bit of a legend and it will take on all the trappings of a legend and barbara chaseribouds novel will not be the last novel there will be many novels there will be many plays there will be other kinds of things done in connection with this love story which also tells a whole lot about power in america and about the idealism and the kind of people who helped to make this nation great the kind of person who helped to twist events in a way which led the way established the prerequisite for what later happened with lincoln and the emancipation proclamation as much as he was the author of the declaration of independence the third president of the united states and the purchaser of the louisiana territory thomas jefferson was also the concerned father of several children of african descent with unfortunate limitations and restraints the evidence is that jefferson loved his commonlaw wife and his children he was not a brilliant coldblooded beast the hypocrisy he felt compelled to perpetrate certainly created a personal life wracked with intense conflicts jeffersons public statements on race and slavery often stand in opposition to his private passion and compassion however when his intimate relationship with sally is affixed to selected public actions it is clear that he consciously made a vital contribution to the abolition of slavery there are many who contend that without jefferson there could never have been an emancipating abraham lincoln congressman jefferson attempted to halt the expansion of slavery into new states and failed by one vote in the house of representatives as president he narrowly won a victory for a law that finally ended the legal importation of slaves it is also important to note that jeffersons advocacy for the rights of the common white man had to take roots before lincoln could fight the war that freed the slaves let me repeat it is also important to note that jeffersons advocacy for the rights of the common white man had to take roots before lincoln could fight the war that freed the slaves jefferson was quoted by the slave mongers as well as by the abolitionists as they made their cases during his time or shortly after his death and up to the civil war into the civil war both sides claimed jefferson until today he is still cited by racists as well as progressives the new dna clarification of his paternity of sally hemings children may finally end this ideological tug of war in a superficial response the races may jettison the man who treated the slave mother of his children as if she were his commonlaw wife a more profound response from progressives in general and african americans specifically would be a new celebration of jefferson as the prerequisite to lincoln it is an historical fact that one of jeffersons proteges edward coles took his slaves from virginia to illinois where he gave them their freedom and acres of land edward coles later became governor of illinois he defeated a referendum seeking to make illinois a slave state and he was an active politician in illinois at the time of lincolns election and at the time of the civil war more than mere words and ideas connected thomas jefferson to abraham lincoln celebrations of the new jefferson discoveries and expressions of gratitude to the science of genetics which produced dna testing i think are very much in order what the historians and the researchers of several generations refused to examine objectively has now been determined to be almost certainly true the white male southern academicians who have dominated the interpretation of pre and post civil war history have now been thoroughly discredited their refusal to accept overwhelming evidence with respect to jefferson of necessity raises serious questions about the integrity of the rest of their scholarship some obvious indictments of these proponents of the confederate view of history are now in order the establishment historians are guilty of ignoring the record of widespread miscegenation fostered by white men and its implications mainstream scholars have refused to offer any meaningful expositions of the breeding farm industry for example on the other hand postcivil war terrorism and violence by the defeated rebels has been glorified the birth of a nation movie was an interpretation that has never been answered by academicians with a true and thorough story of the terrorism the murder and the mayhem which returned the blacks of the south to a state of semislavery i am talking about what a truth and reconciliation commission could have accomplished instead of a truth and reconciliation commission we had john wilkes booth we had booth assassinating lincoln we had andrew johnson who took over at that point the last thing he wanted was truth and as a result we had a downward slide back into the era when terror murder and mayhem for the blacks in the south returned and it took us another 100 or more than 100 years to get back to restoring the civil rights of the africanamerican population certainly of the south if we had some truth if we had some honest historians to shed some light along the way on some of these things we might have made different kinds of public policy decisions and of course the reason i am here today is because there is a definite connection our present race problems our present serious race problems as far as african americans are concerned are rooted in 232 years of slavery there are still people who make speeches about african americans being inferior african americans are prone to criminal activities african americans are generally not as well off as other people even immigrants who came to this country much later than the african americans have accumulated more wealth there are answers to all of these assertions to all of these misstatements of fact there are answers but unless you have a concerted systematic pursuit of truth you are never going to be able to establish the answers which will allow us to have meaningful public policymaking in summary the recent kingpin discovery which confirms the commonlaw marriage relationship between thomas jefferson and sally hemings has generated new demands for more historical truth to support current reconciliation between whites and african americans i am saying that the recent kingpin discovery which confirms the commonlaw marriage relationship between thomas jefferson and sally hemings has generated new demands for more historical truth to support current reconciliation between whites and african americans i believe that the truth can support reconciliation i do not think the truth has to be a generator of more hostility and ill will since there was no truth in reconciliation commission established following the civil war it would be wise to currently create a substitute project that has come as close as we can to a truth in reconciliation commission we did not have the advantage of the south african nation has when it tried to get rid of a large part of the baggage and the garbage related to racial oppression the victimization the response to the victimization the people seeking revenge all kinds of poison existed that the south african government is trying to get rid of by establishing a truth in reconciliation commission we had no such commission following the civil war instead of a comprehensive approach similar to the truth in reconciliation commission and instead of a comprehensive approach which was attempted by the presidents commission on race it is reconmnended that smaller components of the overall problem of unitedstates race relations be explored separately i recommend that we have this kind of nobel prize guided winner guided truthseeking group who would write an objective history for us of slavery i would recommend that it be explored in segments an objective rewrite of the history of slavery in america constitutes a productive beginning they may want to go back and write the history of slavery for all times they may want to write the history of the exploitation and the destruction of the indian nations the native americans on this continent they may want to get segments in order to help tell the whole story but certainly the history of slavery in america would constitute a productive beginning an objective history of what it was all about you know what does it mean to keep people for 232 years in bondage what was the cruelty and the abuse of children and the attempt to obliterate the humanity of human beings what were the consequences of that and as i said earlier a consortium of foundations could finance such a sweeping study and nobel prize winning scholars throughout the world could be recruited to supervise such a study and to guarantee the objectivity of such a study in that demonstration of extraordinary and original insight into the dynamics of civilization development and nation building the recently formed government of south africa the government of nelson mandela has pointed the way out of contradictions the way out of conflicts and enmities which heretofore had seemed to be inevitable to avoid the endless sufferings and social retardations inflicted by lies guilt and preoccupations with revenge nations must labor vigorously the process of striving must be supported systematically and with adequate resources by governments since america has not yet matched the south africans in their recognition of the power of this approach let us imagine the ghost of thomas jefferson and sally hemings holding hands as they hover over us we must strive harder to acquire insights from the emotion laden and sociologically complex legend of thomas jefferson and sally hemings let me close by saying that i applaud and congratulate the university of virginia and the thomas jefferson memorial foundation for a conference which they held on the weekend of march 5 which brought together 20 scholars from all over the nation to explore the meaning of the relationship of thomas jefferson and sally hemings for american history and they intend to publish an entire series of writings on this subject the university of virginia and the thomas jefferson memorial foundation are moving in the right direction to take an objective fact of history and use that fact of history for a very positive purpose if it helps america to seek reconciliation among the races then it will have made a great contribution before we can have reconciliation we need to have truth and the truth of the relationship between thomas jefferson and sally hemings is a magnificent truth that should be thoroughly examined the article referred to follows"], [0.001999795436859131, 0.9980002045631409, 1, "i trust i will be joined by some of my colleagues before the evening is over with to talk on the issue but as my colleague the gentleman from colorado was talking about a moment ago on social seburity i would remind our colleagues and those who are listening this evening that social security has been with us now since the 1930s there have been those who have talked about its demise ever since and some who have tried to make sure it was not here but i would remind them as we talk about all of the gimmicks anytime we take money out of the system if it is 2 percent or 3 percent or whatever the percent we take out that is less money we have for those who are drawing it means that we will meet that date of finality he was talking about and it will run out of money sooner i was home this weekend and had an occasion to see a movie the gentleman from colorado talked about the turmoil and all the tough times as if it were a turmoil and that reminds me of a movie i saw called the perfect storm when these fishermen went out to catch their final catch and they made the fatal decision to head into a storm without really having all the facts if you have not seen the movie the perfect storm i will not give away all the plot i would say to my colleagues just like dealing with social security anything else we better know where we are headed because the perfect storm was a total disaster one of the worst in our history this evening i want to talk about investing in our future as the former chief of my state schools i want to talk this evening about a critical issue facing our nation and that is the education of our children and the buildings in which we put them as well because it is about investing these dollars that congress is talking about now that we have or we may have over the next 10 years before we get too far along this road of making some decisions on tax relief at a time when we better be investing in the next generation there is no question that we can have targeted relief but we better be making the investment in our young people all too often in this town we hear politicians making speeches about how the schools are supposedly no good how they ought to have competition how it is really in the private sector that things are really happening it is really not in the public sector i am here this evening to tell my colleagues that i am one of those who will defend the public schools as the best opportunity for excellence in education for all children and we need to stand up and be counted and spread the good news about those quiet successes thosestories that are happening in communities all across this country that are not being told too many times we like to talk about problems it is easy to talk about negatives people will listen this morning i had the opportunity in my district to visit one of those success stories and i would say that any member serving in this body can find a success story in their district any time they want to find it we can always find the glass half empty the question is do we really want to find it half full education and public education is that great leveler in society that helps people have an opportunity to move up as i said i visited one of those successes this morning and i am honored to have an opportunity this evening to brag a little bit on those students and those teachers on those teachers assistants an outstanding principal and an awful lot of people that contributed to the success of a bunch of children this morning i visited harnett primary school in dunn north carolina to participate in a teacher appreciation day that was put on by the local pto and business people in that community i can say i was amazed at the success that principal linda turlington had with her wonderful faculty staff and students but i probably would not be totally honest because i know them they are outstanding people and they work hard but i think if they were here this evening talking with my colleagues and others what they would say is they represent millions of teachers and staff who go in to an awful lot of nice schools some not so nice schools and some buildings that children ought not to even be in because of the condition they are in and they work hard every day and go home in the evenings and prepare for the next day to help children meet the challenges of the 21stcentury let me talk for just a minute if i may about principal linda turlington and about her wonderful staff and her faculty and all of those students just 4 years ago 4 short years ago they had a performance that they were not happy with only about 50 percent of her students or their students were performing at what is called grade level on the north carolina endofgrade test they decided that was not acceptable they could do a better job with their children if they worked together and i spoke to them about that this morning because it is fine to have one outstanding teacher one outstanding principal but it is what we have to have as everyone working together as a team to make a difference we can have a great athletic team and we can have a superstar but if all we have is one superstar they may make a difference in some games they will not win all the games we have to be a team so they started to work they started identifying students they started making sure their curriculum was rich it was strong that they were helping every children achieve so last year they went from 50 percent to raise that level or the year before last last year almost 80 percent of their children 77 4 percent had reached grade level this morning they were saying that is not good enough they are working for all their children that is real progress it is the kind of improvement we ought to go about making in every community in every county in every state across the country and we can do it but we can only do it when we talk about the successes and help people achieve the best they can achieve we cannot do it when we always talk about all the problems that run people down this did not happen by accident it took dedication hard work on the part of teachers implementing the best practices they could get not only in their school but in their system pulling down the best ideas all across the state and across the country they practiced the things they learned and they shared it on a collective basis and they brought in some of the best minds to work with them everyone was committed and focused on achieving and sharing the goals of one thing to improve student achievement now did this school achieve all of these great successes because they had the best students in the county system the answer is no they had outstanding students every school does remember this is the same school that only had 50 percent 4 years before what was different it was certainly attitude on the part of the teachers and everyone on that staff and it was also the attitude on the part of parents and students who said we can do better and we will do better i am so proud that this school has achieved the exemplary status for the people in dunn and for harnett primary but i say to my colleagues this evening that rather than badmouthing our public schools like many politicians in this town do congress needs to support the sincere effort under way on the ground as we work to improve our schools for all of our children every child whether they come from a background of parents who have resources to help them or whether they come from parents who want their children to do well but just do not have those resources every parent in the 8 years i served as superintendent i never met a parent who did not want or desire for their children to have a good education they may not have known how to get there but they wanted it for them we have that challenge today we have it next week and we will have it next year certainly congress has no business in my opinion trying to be a national school board that is not our charge nor our responsibility it is a statefunded responsibility and local delivery of education but there is no reason that congress should not cannot and ought not to put resources in to help those young people in those schools and areas where they are not achieving where they should be achieving we made that decision years ago and the federal funding for education has slipped since the 1960s we went through a period where we saw it drop and now it is coming back and we need to continue that push it is so important the 21st century in my opinion will be a century that will belong to the educated let me repeat that again the 21st century will belong to the educated there was a time when you could get a job if you dropped out of school those days are fast disappearing we spend a lot of time in this town arguing back and forth about appropriations budgets et cetera et cetera but what gets lost too often in all the sound and fury of legislative debate is the central meaning of the choices we make the choices we make are about our priorities they also say something about our character what we care about where we put our resources or our money if you please tells people what is important to us if you go into a town and you see a nice school building where the parents and the community are invested and involved in it says education is important in that town i happen to believe if you go into a town with a rundown building children recognize very quickly that is not the most important priority on the part of the people in that town if the businesses are in order it says that business is important i think you can have a partnership of all the budget a7nd spending choices we make here define what our priorities are as i said earlier they truly express our values i would say to you that many of my colleagues in the democratic caucus and i have been working all year to try to give greater priority to education in this budget process why education as i said earlier because education is the key to the future for every child every child no matter what their ethnic or economic background may happen to be you deny a child an educational opportunity and you have denied a future family an opportunity to prepare and invest in the next generation it is as simple as that certainly we value education and we value it because we know that lifetime learning is the key to the american dream and today it is that ultimate ticket to the middle class everyone wants to get there whether a child is born into poverty today if they get an education they can be in the middle class tomorrow but if we deny them an educational opportunity they are relegated to poverty and so are their future children we talk about the global economy and americas international competitiveness certainly we are in a global economy what happens on the other side of the world through telecommunications we know about it now almost instantaneously but it also means that what happens on the other side of the globe economically impacts us and we are going to have to deal with them educationally and our ability to have a knowledgebased job economy is important that does not mean agriculture will not be important in the future certainly it will be it will continue to be i grew up on a farm in my home state as i tell my colleagues from time to time i grew up on what we call a small family farm i knew what it was to get up at 3 oclock in the morning and take out tobacco and prime tobacco all day but those jobs have changed those small farms are much larger today when we talk about family tarms where i grew up on a 5075 acre farm now when you talk about a farm the farmer is talking about hundreds of acres it has changed technologically it has changed the equipment you use is different it means that even the farmers have to be better educated to compete today they have to know financing they have to have computers their equipment is driven technologically the combines the tractors all of those are the same thing just like the factories are computer driven that is why children need to have technology in the classroom and teachers need to have it so they can teach it and integrate it in the curriculum so in this new economy of this information age what people can earn will certainly depend on what they have learned we see that each and every day we see more young people today becoming millionaires on the dotcorn but in the end we have to make something they are speeding up the process it comes back again to what i started talking about it is about education it is about access so everyone has a chance at this table i used to tell folks when i was superintendent this thing we call public education in america is one of the great opportunities in the world it is one of the few places in the world that i know of that every child no matter what their ethnic or economic background may happen to be they can step up to the great smorgasbord and if they are willing to work and learn they can go as far as their ability will carry them we have opened that door of opportunity we ought to keep it open and we need to swing it open even wider right on beyond high school because today just having 12 years or 13 years is just not adequate we are going to need 2 and even 4 or more years beyond high school as we move into this 21st century so we have been trying here in congress to get this congress to give higher priority to strengthen our neighborhood schools and demonstrate how much we value education for our children yes it takes resources yes that is money when you have children who have special needs they will be contributing members ofsociety if we give them an opportunity to get an education yes those children who have been deprived early will do better if we open the doors and give them prekindergarten and special care early on they will be contributing members and they can make a difference in society and be good students in school but a child who starts school behind i am here to tell you will have a tough time and many of them may never catch up that is why head start is important for every child who needs it there are those who would tell you well we cannot do it we cannot afford it can we afford not to can we afford to have losers i dont think so i think we are a big enough society we are a big enough country we have the resources to do all those things if we do it but unfortunately the house republican leadership has said that we need a lot of other things first i happen to believe that we need targeted tax cuts buteverything i read lately tells me that what we decided last year we had almost 800 billion this time we are talking about doing it in pieces so we will have more and we want to starve them so they will not have the resources i grew up on a farm and one of the things i never forgot that my dad told me he said son dont feed the seed corn use your best corn to replant it so next year you can have a good harvest what this majority wants to do is eat the seed corn so that our next generation will not have the opportunities and that is wrong we need to make the kind of educational investments so that we can make our schools world class so we can have high quality curriculum for every child in every classroom and yes we ought to hold them accountable we ought to have high standards because just as i told you at the outset earlier today the school in dunn north carolina harnett primary school is holding their children accountable holding their parents accountable holding themselves accountable setting high standards and those students are reaching it i certainly oppose these misguided priorities we ought to invest in education we ought to hold the system ac countable and we ought to get it done i am pleased at this time to yield to the gentleman from new jersey mr holt to discuss more about our priorities in education he certainly has been a leader in the whole area of education but he has focused his attention on science education he is one of the true scientists here in congress and brings a lot to the table"], [0.002576470375061035, 0.997423529624939, 1, "i would like to talk about the need to share the current wealth and prosperity of america with working families in 1989 the value of the stock market was 3 trillion ten years later today in 1999 the value of the stocks in all the exchanges is 13 trillion from 3 trillion to 13 trillion that is what the increased value of the stock market has been that is quite an overwhelming increase in wealth we enjoy unprecedented prosperity today so i would like to talk about how this prosperity and wealth should be shared with workers instead of attacking working families we need to find ways to reward working families and to share this wealth there are many ways to share the wealth and prosperity of the nation at this point certainly i do not propose that we do what the roman empire did at one point the roman empire was so wealthy as a result of its conquests its taxation policies on its oppressed victims defeated nations around it that it had so much money that it decreed that every roman citizen would be paid each year a certain amount of money out of the treasury that was real sharing i do not think it succeeded for very long because once the word got out that every roman citizen could share in the booty and they would pay them part of the accumulated wealth of the nation all the people in the surrounding countryside moved into rome in large numbers they filled up rome and that policy was brought down by the sheer weight of numbers i do not think we should ever try to repeat anything of that kind however i think that we can share the wealth of the nation with working families by improving health care and making certain that every american citizen has decent health care i think we can share the prosperity and the wealth of the nation by making certain that education is available for every american citizen the children of working families for example are the children who go to public schools they have no alternative so our public system of education which by the way has 54 million enrolled pupils that system should be given as much help as possible by all sectors of our economy governmental and private as well so education health care i think if you improve those things it would be two ways to share the wealth with working families there is another very concrete and direct way to share the wealth with working families and that is to share the dollars the best way to help somebody who is poor is to give them money directly dollars in the hands of the poor are the most efficient and effective way to deal with poverty so instead of attacking the working families as some of our present republican legislation is seeking to do let us have a bipartisan coalition on helping working families by raising the minimum wage let us raise the minimum wage and put some dollars in the pockets of working families and they can put food on the table better clothes better housing and take care of themselves we do not have that spirit here in this congress i appreciate the fact that we do not have a situation similar to the one that existed just a little more than 2 years ago in the 105th congress the 105th congress started out with a set of direct assaults on working families we had direct assaults and we came on with the very first bill of the year the very first bill in the 105th congress was h r 1 which was designed to take away the cash overtime payments from working families that may seem like ancient history now but it was on a roller coaster in the first debates of the 105th congress it was on a roller coaster because it had support from the white house it had support from the majority of the democrats a bill which said we will not pay workers any more in cash overtime we will force them to take comp time and the comp time has to be taken at the discretion of the employer i pointed out in fact that what the workers needed was the cash extra cash that the overtime provided more than anything else an argument was offered that well there are a lot of professionals and middleclass people who would like to have the option of having time off instead of more cash i pointed out at that time that we in no way the fair labor standards act does not really interfere with people having time off instead of cash there are ways to deal with that if people prefer that voluntarily but what they were doing by mandating that the fair labor standards act be changed was mandating that every worker had to accept the situation where time off would be at the discretion of the employer and no cash i pointed out at that time that twothirds of the people in america who worked for a living wage earners twothirds made less than 10 an hour less than 10 an hour and i said let those twothirds who make less than 10 an hour be exempted from your proposed legislation which would mandate time off instead of overtime and it did get a few votes on the floor my amendment but it did not pass however thank god the forces of common sense were at work all the time and what seemed like a steamrolling proposition in the early days of the 105th congress petered out the labor unions got moving the common sense of the average worker out there got moving public opinion became involved and the whole concept of forcing a change in the fair labor standards act to require comp time instead of overtime and cash just disappeared i am very appreciative of the fact that we do not hear any more about it there are some other frontal attacks on working families that we do not hear about this year and i am glad we do not hear them any more there were frontal attacks on osha to merely wipe out the agency reduce the budget by twothirds osha takes care of the health and safety of workers the occupational safety and health administration is there to take care of providing safe workplaces there were attacks which said that osha was threatening american industry that business could not survive if osha continued to exist these attacks persisted despite the fact that many of us pointed out the fact that osha staff had been so reduced that in my lifetime it was not likely that a business would be visited it takes a cycle of more than 100 years for the inspectors to get around to visiting those businesses out there to examine the conditions to see if they meet osha standards so osha was not a gestapo like agency with numerous staff members to come down on business that was not true that frontal attack has ceased and we are grateful for that there was also an attack on the unions and their ability to use their funds for any political purposes it was called the paycheck protection act the paycheck protection act was really going for the jugular vein wipe out the ability of unions to speak for their members cut it off completely and if it could not be won at the federal level there were also movements in the states fomented and encouraged by the leadership of the republican majority here in thehouse the paycheck protection act is no longer being discussed this year we are grateful that working families do not have to worry about losing their voice in the political arena that is no longer a problem then there were the attacks on davisbacon that came loud and frequently davisbacon was being attacked relentlessly although as i often point out davis and bacon were two republicans who devised a system for protecting workers in situations where large federal contracts were involved they did not want the wages of the local areas to be eroded by having these large contractors come in and bring outside workers in to do the work at lower wages so it was common sense built in all the way from the beginning these frontal assaults the constant unrelenting attempt to batter down the protections for working families are not happening here in the 106th congress i serve as the ranking democrat on the subcommittee for workforce protections of the committee on education and the workforce and i know that at the committee level and the subcommittee level we are getting a guerilla attack guerilla ambushes have replaced the frontal assault not the same amount of noise is being made they do not rush these items to the floor and expect immediate endorsements and passage but there is a slow chipping away at the protections for working families working families are still in danger in this republican controlled congress working families still have to fear a bush whacking a quiet assault an ambush in a number of areas i say that i want to call on this 106th congress where all of us most of us subscribe to the notion that we are more civil and would like to have a bipartisan approach to certain issues let us have a bipartisan approach to rewarding working families working families make up the majority of america out there working families need better health care they need decent education they need more help from the federal government for education first of all working families need dollars in their pockets and we can do that by increasing the minimum wage increasing the minimum wage is what i want to talk most about it is all integrally interwoven we need to increase the minimum wage and the minimum wage is where there are entry level workers who are now making 5 15 an hour we have proposed to raise that by fifty cents in one year that is the presidents proposal fifty cents in one year and then another fifty cents another year which means a dollar increase over a 2year period it will not make anybody rich people who are making 10 000 a year would be making a little more than 12 000 a year after we raise the minimum wage a lot of people have a lot of questions about whether the minimum wage really is important because after all most americans are not making minimum wage i am going to show some statistics recent statistics in a few minutes to let everyone know that quite a number of americans still make minimum wage and there are a lot who make below minimum wage that are working every day for wages below minimum wage because minimum wage is not mandated for the smallest business there are a number of situations where minimum wage does not impact so instead of attacks on working families i propose that we move forward in a bipartisan effort to reward working families by increasing the minimum wage at a town meeting that i had just last night where there were quite a number of people who came out people are very concerned about a number of items a number of federal actions that are being taken at the top of the list of course is kosovo and what is going to happen with kosovo and the intervention of our american forces along with nato will we send in ground troops or will they appropriate more money for the effort and in the process of appropriating more money for the war effort will we downgrade the efforts to improve medicare by having something added to medicare which will cover prescription drugs will we downgrade our efforts to improve the education system and say that we have no money because this war effort is going to absorb all the resources those are very important questions and people are very concerned about that by the way i asked for a show of hands in an audience of about 200 people as to was there support for the present actions in kosovo the bombing of kosovo to stop the dictator milosevic slobodan milosevic which i call a sovereign predator responsible for unspeakable horrors in that area of the country was there support for the present action that the united states was taking along with its nato allies practically every hand in the house went up supporting it the overwhelming majority 95 percent of the people supported taking action however i might point out that when i asked how many would support escalating the combat effort escalating the effort to the use of ground troops i had just the opposite reaction only about 5 percent raised their hands i think that is very informative to get back to todays subject their primary concerns or i might not say primary but equal to kosovo were concerns about social security and concerns about medicare and concerns about education these are all things that are very important to working families when we help to improve education we are improving a lot of working families the public school system that is being attacked by a lot of people in the majority the republican majority they want to replace the public school system with a privatized system they want vouchers to replace federal aid to education they want to give up on the public school system as i said before there are 54 million students in the public school system fiftyfour million students are enrolled only a small percentage of our population of schoolage students attend private schools today and if we were to make some kind of effort to greatly increase the funding for private schools it would still be a very slow process of moving more and more of our youngsters into private schools so just logistically and statistically not much help is going to come in the near future from a private school effort or from giving vouchers and sending working family children off to find a private school so any attacks on public education are also attacks on working families one might want to know that the federal government does not do very much for these 54 million children out there in public schools our expenditure for elementary and secondary education presently is about 22 billion a year the annual expenditure for elementary and secondary education is about 22 billion our current expenditure for highways and transportation is 51 billion to let everyone see what the contrast is we are spending only 22 billion for education but 51 billion for highways i use that example because a lot of people continue to confront me with the issue of local control and say that it is not the federal governments business to worry about education it is not the federal governments business to be involved in education they ask why would i want to saddle the federal government with responsibilities in the area of education well let me ask this is it the federal governments responsibility to be involved in roads and highways that was always a local responsibility highways and roads were for states and local governments to take care of nothing in the constitution gives the federal government the responsibility for maintaining the highways and the roads but now we are at the point where we currently are spending 51 billion last year we had the biggest expenditure in history for highways and transportation approved that expenditure will be about 218 billion over a 6year period 218 billion over a 6year period contrast that with what the president is proposing to spend for school construction over a 5year period he is proposing to spend 3 7 billion to pay the interest on 25 billion worth of loans that the local governments and the state governments will have to make for education so the contrast is overwhelming these are children of working families who go to the public schools school construction would be an initiative to help working family children people say that inner cities do not deserve to be given priority for education funding and we should take away the title i money and put it into edflex and let the governors and the local decisionmakers spend the money for anything they want to related to education do not concentrate on the original purpose of title i the original purpose of the federal governments involvement in education was to help the poorer communities forget about that they do not deserve that there are democrats who say that we should not have a construction bill a school construction bill which gives first priority to the cities well we give first priorities to the inner cities because that is where most of the children are most of the population of america lives in the big cities when it comes time to fight wars most of the people who go off to die are the young people from big cities if one goes to the vietnam memorial wall they will find that the wall is full of people who come from the big cities and it is full of the children from working families children from working families went out to die in world war i and world war ii and children from working families died in vietnam if we have a war in kosovo that expands to a ground war the majority of those who would die in combat will be from working families in big cities i yield to the gentlewoman from ohio"], [0.0026427507400512695, 0.9973572492599487, 1, "i listened to the previous speaker on the republican side and i know he is well intended but i wanted to say that i feel very strongly that one of the reasons we are still here and certainly one of the reasons that has been articulated by the president in his opposition to this republican tax bill that he has said he will not sign he will veto if it comes to his desk is because democrats and the president and the vice president feel very strongly that with regard to a number of issues and i am going to spend time primarily this evening on the health care issues that the republican leadership has simply not done its job we as democrats are very concerned about the average citizen and what we do in the house of representatives and feel very strongly that on a number of issues and again particularly with regard to hbalth care that the republican leadership has simply failed to address the problems that the average american cares about we know that we are in times of great economic prosperity and as a result of the presidents programs that prosperity continues there is a significant federal surplus for the first time now in a long time but the problem is that we still have some unmet needs and particularly with regard to health care what we see in this tax bill that the previous gentleman from south dakota mentioned and that has been the discussion of much debate over the last few days is that the republicans really are prioritizing what i call special interests particularly with regard to hmos as opposed to the public interest i have been very critical of the fact that this tax bill that came to the floor last thursday gave the lions share of the money to the hmos without any strings attached without any requirement that they stay in the medicare program many of my constituents have complained to me about the fact that they signed up with an hmo under medicare and then a year later or so they were notified that the hmo was no longer going to cover them and they had to find some other way to cover their health insurance granted they can go back to the traditional medicare feeforservice system and that is fine for most people 85 percent of people who are under medicare that is fine and that is great but there are problems in the sense that traditional feeforservice does not cover prescription drugs many of my seniors signed up for hmos because they were sort of lured into it by promises on the part of the hmos that they would get a prescription drug benefit and then all of a sudden they found that they did not have one well what the hmos did is they came back to the republican leadership and said look we are getting out of medicare because we are not getting enough money so give us more money give us a larger reimbursement rate and we will get back into the program the problem is that the tax bill the republicans put up last week did not attach any strings they are saying okay we are going to give 40 percent of this new money that we have in the surplus or 40 percent of the money allocated in this bill to hmos but they do not say that they have to stay in the program for more than a year they do not say that they have to guarantee any particular level of benefits i actually had a motion which i brought to the floor yesterday or the day before last which said that in order to get this additional money they would have to agree to stay in the medicare program for at least 3 years and they would have to provide the level of benefits that they initially promised for that 3year period of course the reference is primarily to prescription drug benefits which is why most seniors signed up for hmos in the context of medicare the republican leadership opposed that inotion and they basically say look we want to give this money to the hmos and we are not going to have any real strings attached to it the democrats and the president have been saying that in addition to the fact that they are giving this money to the hmos with no strings attached they are taking away or they are not giving sufficient funds or prioritizing funding for the providers of medicare the hospitals the nursing homes the home health care agencies they get significantly less percent of this money under the republican bill than the hmos do and yet they are the ones that are really providing the service the hmos are just insurance companies that ultimately go to the hospitals and the nursing homes to provide the service and these primary providers are getting less of a percentage of this pot than the hmos again i would say it is because the hmos are aligned with the republicans and basically the republican leadership is doing their bidding now what do the hmos do with the money that they get from the federal government well first they provide services but we know a lot of them spend a significant amount of that money paying for their ceos they have huge overhead huge administrative expenses for a lot of their executives they do a tremendous amount of advertising that is how they get the seniors to sign up for the hmos doing all of this advertising and having these meetings and giving out free dinners and different things to get the seniors to come and sign tip then they also spend a significant amount of their money lobbying and spending money on political ads to lobby against the democrats initiative the medicare prescription drug program that we have proposed and the hmo reforms the patients bill of rights that we have proposed they also spend a lot of their money just in direct or indirect independent expenditure contributions to argue against and for the defeat of democratic candidates i was one of the victims of that i found myself 2 years ago in 1998 the target of an independent expenditure primarily financed by hmos and the pharmaceutical industry to the tune of 5 million spent in the last 2 or 3 weeks of the campaign to try to defeat me so it is no wonder that it costs the hmos so much money to operate and why they feel they need more money to operate because so much of their expenditure goes for these other things that are not health care related now what the democrats did today is we tried when there was a bill that came up to correct this tax bill with regard to another aspect a minimum wage the democrats tfied to bring up an alternative bill or amend the republican legislation so that it included some changes that would diminish the percentage of the money that went to the hmos and give more as a percentage basis to hospitals and primary providers nursing homes home health care agencies at the same time it would say that if the hmos wanted to benefit from this additional money that was being provided under the bill that they would have to stay in the medicare program for 3 years and they could not reduce their benefits it seems to me that makes a lot of sense we know the hmos are getting out of the system there have been many reports one done by the gao the general accounting office just last month in september that said that providing more money to the hmos is not necessarily going to make them stay within the medicare system so why not try a different way of trying to get them into the system i want to talk a little more about some of the other things that we had in this proposal today because i think it goes to the heart of my initial contention that the democrats are trying to deal with the problems the health care problems that the average american faces whereas the republicans keep trying to do something with this bill that is primarily for the special interests and for the hmos just to give my colleagues an idea we had additional money as i said for hospitals we had additional money for the staffing and quality control for nursing homes we had additional payments to home health agencies i have been critical of the fact that the republicans have not been willing to bring up the patients bill of rights which is the hmo reform that prevents abuses in hmos and says the decisions about what kind of care one gets what kind of operation one gets what kind of hospital stay one gets that those decisions should be made by the insurance company and the patient and not by the hmo the insurance company the republicans have not been willing to bring up the patients bill of rights they passed it in the house but it is dead in the senate so what we put in this bill as an alternative to the republican tax plan today also was a provision that says that if one has to appeal a decision under medicare because one has been denied care by an hmo that one would have a better way to appeal that go to an outside review board if you will to make that appeal so the hmo would not basically be reviewing its own decisions somebody else would this is part of what we had proposed in the patients bill of rights so we were not only trying to give more we were not only trying to level the playing field with the hmos and require them to stay in the medicare program for longer period of time we were also trying to address the issue or the need for hmo reform now the other thing that we were trying to do in this bill today which i think is a distinct improvement over what the republicans had in mind is that it relates to the issue of the uninsured if we ask americans today about health care and what are the primary problems they will say hmo abuses they will say the need for a medicare prescription drug but for those who do not have health insurance which is about 42 million americans they will say it is the need to provide affordable health insurance so that they can get health insurance well in this bill in this tax bill that the republicans put forward last week and has been the subject of discussion for the last few days the republicans said that they are going to give an aboveline deduction for individuals who buy their health insurance i have been critical of that because it is not going to help again the people who do not have health insurance in other words most of the people that would be able to take advantage of that are people who already have health insurance and they will get a deduction but what about the 42 million people that do not the type of deduction that is provided is not really going to provide a system for those 42 million or few of them to buy health insurance because their problem is their employer does not provide it and they cannot afford it on the private market a little bit of a deduction the way the republicans haveset forth is not going to get them to be able to afford health insurance what the democrats have been saying with regard to the uninsured and again this is vice president gores proposal is that we have to build on the existing kids health initiative which was passed here in the house of representatives and became law a few years ago that provides federal monies back to the states so that they can sign up children of working parents who now cannot afford health insurance what vice president gore has been saying what president clinton and what the democrats have been saying is let us expand that program to a little higher income level so that the kids whose parents work but maybe are a little above the current guidelines will still be able to take advantage of this program we have also been saying that perhaps we should let the parents of these children buy into the program it is more likely that if a parent can provide or get health insurance for their children that they would like to sign up the whole family for this program with these federal dollars so i have been critical of this republican tax plan because it really does not do anything to get more people enrolled in health insurance who do not have it i would like to see some changes instead in some money used under this bill to sign up more people and get more people involved in this kids health initiative so what we have in the democratic alternative that was discussed today but of course defeated was a way of providing additional coverage money that would be used to do outreach to get more children enrolled in the program again it is a different approach to what the republicans have proposed but i think it is an approach that will work in getting more people provided and covered by health insurance whereas i do not think the republican proposal accomplishes that i want to stress throughout this because i hear my republican colleagues say that this tax bill is a great bill and the president should sign it because it is going to help well i am not going to argue that in some ways it might help a little but given the amount of money that is being thrown to the hmos given the amount of money that is being given to a lot of these special interests it is not going to help very much we could use that same amount of money in a different way under the democratic proposal to really do a lot more to make sure that seniors who are on medicare can find an hmo that provides them with decent coverage including prescription drugs we can do a lot more to cover the uninsured with that same amount of money than what the republicans are doing now just to give my colleagues some perspective on this in the tax bill that the republicans put forward and passed over onethird of the federal dollars were allocated to hmos it is almost 40 percent 41 42 percent the republican plan increases payments to medicare hmos by over 10 billion over 5 years and over 30 billion over 10 years despite the fact that only 16 percent of medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in hmos well keep that in mind in other words if one has this senior group of seniors and disableds that are in medicare now only 16 percent of them are in an hmo yet when we address the issue of trying to provide additional funding for medicare we are going to give for those 16 percent 40 percent of the money the other 85 percent who would benefit more from having this money go to the hospitals or the nursing homes or the home health agencies directly they are only getting 60 percent of the money it makes no sense other than if one looks at it from the perspective that the republicans are with the hmos because they are helping them with their campaigns they are trying to get rid of democrats and they are doing all these other things to help the republican cause i also wanted to give my colleagues another example this was an article that i took from usa today back in february of 2000 but i have kept it because it really kind of says a lot about what the hmos do with the money this report found 4 7 million in questionable administrative costs among nine medicare hmos including lobbying and gifts one insurer spent 249 283 on food gifts and alcoholic beverages four hmos spent 106 490 for sporting events and theater tickets another leased a luxury box at a sports arena for 25 000 customers insurance brokers and employees at one hmo were treated to 37 000 in wines flowers and other gifts i gave the example the other day of where an hmo in my district did this huge advertising campaign to get people to go to the local diner they offered them a maine lobster dinner for the evening to get good people to sign up for the hmo i mean this is crazy here we are being asked to give more money to the hlios so that they can spend the money for these administrative costs for this advertising and these other things that ultimately do very little if anything to help the average senior or the average american now i wanted to if i could spend a little time talking about the democratic alternatives on the two issues of prescription drugs and hmo reform and i will probably also get in a little bit to the issue of dealing with the uninsured i talked so far about these issues in the context of this tax package today but what i want to reiterate to my colleagues is the fact that over the last 2 years and even beyond since the republican leadership has been in the majority here there are major overhauls of all these programs that could have been done and that in fact were proposed and even in some cases voted on by the house that were initiated by the democrats with the help of some"],

all americans on this subcommittee i am also pleased to join the gentleman from new york in cosponsoring this particular piece of legislation i had the great honor 112 years ago of getting involved with members of the disability community and members of this house and in particular a member of the republican side of the aisle steve bartlett from texas who worked on the passage of the americans with disabilities act it took us approximately 2 years or perhaps a little longer from the initial introduction to its passage and to the signing by president george bush on july 26 1990 because of the length of todays session we have moved from the eve of that signing to the day of that signing today is the 10th anniversary of the americans with disabilities act that act has properly been called i think the most significant civil rights act passed since 1965 from 1965 to 1990 it was a long time a quarter of a century in which we saw a significant segment of our population discriminated against based upon their disability what the americans with disabilities act said very loudly clearly and powerfully was that what we need to do in america is look at peoples ability not their disability we need to look at what people can do what they can contribute to a better america and to a better life for themself and what we said was as it is wrong in america to discriminate against people because of their race or their religion or national origin it is also wrong to discriminate against americans based upon a disability that we needed to look in a nondiscriminatorily way at what could be done by individuals what contribution they could make in employment in education in transportation in communication in public accommodations in every area of our society that bill as we look at its performance 10 years hence has been a success it has not been a total success there still is a long way to go tony coehlo who was the principal sponsor before he left and i really took over his responsibility when he left in 1989 tony coehlo made the point today that we had come a long way but we still had a long way to go another hero of the americans with disabilities act justin dart i am sure that many of my colleagues know justin dart was there today wheelchair bound and constricted by physical disability but with a spirit that is unconstrained by any physical disability a spirit that soars and impels all of us to understand the possibilities that life can present if one has the will to take those possibilities having said that i am pleased to be here tonight to join the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from ohio and others in supporting the passage of the developmental disabilities act that act is a cornerstone of the disability policy and has been in place since 1963 as has been pointed out and was a forerunner of the americans with disabilities act and in many ways was the genesis of that act it has not been substantially reauthorized since 1994 and it is in need of some updating just as our technology and science evolves everyday so do the strategies for reaching engaging and assisting individuals with developmental disabilities individuals with developmental disabilities often have multiple evolving lifelong needs that require interaction with agencies and organizations that offer specialized assistance as well as interaction with generic services in their communities the developmental disability act seeks to provide as i said a voice for those with disabilities as they negotiate the complicated system of public services policies and organizations that we currently have in place the act seeks to provide families with the knowledge and tools they need to help individuals with developmental disabilities become integrated and included in their communities it seeks to foster true independence for those with developmental disabilities and it provides support to protect them from abuse and neglect something clearly that all of us would want this has been a long and arduous road for the act the senate worked tirelessly with the disability community on this bill to ensure that all voices were heard they were and as a result the senate passed its version with title 2 included 99 to zero 0 0030the version of the act that we are considering tonight is somewhat different as has been referenced the act that my colleague from new york and myself introduced yesterday along with the support of the gentleman from virginia the gentleman from michigan the gentleman from florida and the gentleman from ohio included three titles unfortunately this one includes only two while i rise in strong support of this bill i would also like to reinforce my commitment to the segment of this bill that was struck by amendment the gentleman from new york has already done so and i look forward to working with him and the gentleman from ohio in seeing passage of that title that is not in this bill at this point in time title ii of the act would have authorized a funding to states for support of families that have individuals with developmental disabilities that unfortunately was struck from the bill i regret that we were unable to get agreement on including this section which is in the jurisdiction of the committee on education and workforce hopefully hopefully before we adjourn for the year we will be able to pass a bill that includes that section obviously it was a difficult decision for many of us to drop this section as funding to states for family support was and is an important provision in this bill but we did not want to risk losing the rest of the act as well as my colleagues have already stated we intend to work very hard to have family support placed back into the developmental disabilities act during conference i rise in strong support of this bill it is especially appropriate that we pass it today on the anniversary of the 10th year since passing and signage of the americans with disabilities act an act which said to every american now 58 million of us who have a disability of some type or another said to those 58 million people that the door of opportunity the door to empowerment is open to you you have to take the steps or roll the chair or in some way get there but we are going to make sure the door is open for you and we are going to make sure that we take reasonable steps we call them reasonable accommodations that can be done within the framework of reasonable expenses to make sure that the american dream is yours as well notwithstanding the fact that you may have a disability that some of the rest of us do not have passage of this bill tonight is another statement of this congress to a commitment for empowerment and inclusion of all americans irrespective of some arbitrary and capricious distinction we might draw which might otherwise shut them out of enjoying the american dream i am pleased to have had this opportunity to cosponsor and to speak in support of the passage of this bill tonight tonight we commemorate the enactment of the most sweeping civil rights legislation since the civil rights act of 1964 ten years ago tomorrowon july 26 1990president bush signed the historic americans with disabilities act into law this bipartisan legislation prohibits discrimination against more than 50 million disabled americansin employment in public services in transportation in public accommodations and in services operated by private entities the ada sent an unmistakableand long overduemessage to all americans it is unacceptable to discriminate against the disabledto relegate our brothers and sisters to the sideline of our societysimply because they are disabled it is unacceptable and under the ada it is illegal the disabled belong to the american family and must share in all we have to offer equality of opportunity full participation independent living and economic selfsufficiency i will never forget the presidents words on july 26 1990nor the setting more than 2 000 advocates for the disabledsome in wheelchairs some with interpreters some with seeingeye dogsjoined the president members of congress and others in the hot summer sun on the south lawn of the white house some worned that the heat would cause the disabled too many medical problems but the disabledwho have suffered so many indignities so many unjustified acts of discrimination over the yearsinsisted on a major outdoor ceremony and they deserved it as the lead sponsor of the ada in this house that day stands out as one of my proudestespecially when president bush told those gathered every man woman and child with a disability can now pass through onceclosed doors into a bright new era of equality independence and freedom let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down i would be remiss tonight if i did not mention the tireless efforts of our former colleague in this house and my dear friend tony coelho on behalf of the disabled and the ada as many of you know tony now chairs the presidents committee on employment of people with disabilities you also may know that he has epilepsy however you may not be aware of the discrimination he has overcome when tonys epilepsy was discovered some years ago he was expelled from the seminary where he was studying to become a priest he had his drivers license revoked and his insurance company canceled his health coverage simply because he had a disability today because of the ada that type of unjustified and indefensible discrimination is outlawed in americaas it should be i also want to thank and commend an organization in my district that now serves more than 2 000 people with developmental disabilities melwood a nonprofit organization based in upper marlboro maryland has assisted the disabled for 35 years today it is a national model in the areas of training employment housing and recreation theres no doubt that the ada has promoted progress the signs are everywhereramps curb cuts braille signs captioned tv programs and bus lifts so many disabled americans have moved into the mainstream of american life holding down good paying jobs in a new economy where information and knowledge are key but while we commemorate the ada tonight lets not kid ourselves tomorrow we must roll up our sleeves and continue to build the house of opportunity and equality that we began 10 years ago while the unemployment rate in our country hovers around 4 percent unemployment among disabled americans remains unacceptably high just last week the national organization on disability released the findings from a harris survey of americans with and without disabilities and those findings demonstrate how much work we have left to do only 32 percent of disabled people of working age work full or part time compared to 81 percent of nondisabled americans more than twothirds 67 percent of the disabled who are not employed say they would prefer to work and people with disabilities are nearly three times as likely as those without disabilities to live in households with total incomes of 15 000 or less the harris survey also found that large gaps exist between people with and without disabilities with regard to education access to transportation health care socializing attendance at religious services political participation and life satisfaction many of these measures of course are directly linked to employment we know that a good job is the key to independence and selfsufficiency thus i believe we should implement nothing short of a comprehensive national strategy to address this unemployment crisis and continued cycle of dependency first we must continue to make sure that government programs empower citizens and encourage them to seek employment in the private sector for example the ticket to work and work incentive act which extends medicare coverage for disabled recipients who work did just that for too many the fear of losing health insurance has proved to be a deterrent to work we also must redouble our commitment to the publicprivate partnerships created during the last 10 years to expand employment opportunities further in the new economy we must encourage disabled americans to develop their technological skills information and knowledgerather than brawnare power and hold much promise for the disabled thus we need to improve education job training and rehabilitation programs additionally we must address the criticisms and recommendations contained in a recent report by the national council on disability that report found that the impact of the ada has been diminished by the lack of a cohesive proactive enforcement strategy one of the councils principal recommendations is to direct the department of justice to develop a strategic vision and plan for ada enforcement across federal agencies finally we can take a big step in renewing our commitment to disabled americans by passing the development disabilities reauthorization act this week before congress breaks for its summer recess this law is the cornerstone of disability policy paving the way for the ada 10 years ago and providing services support information and training for disabled americans these issues must be addressed if the ada is going to fulfill its promise so as we gather today to commemorate this historic law lets recognize all that weve accomplished lets renew our commitment to the principles and spirit of the ada and lets realize that our work is not done the ada allowed us to tear down the wall of exclusion and pour a strong foundation for the house of equality but that housein which americans are judged by their ability and not their disabilityis still being built the promise remains unfulfilled but still is within reach lets not rest until we complete what we began 10 years ago"], [0.002882838249206543, 0.9971171617507935, 1, "i want to say that the gentleman from pennsylvania has had just a fascinating discourse on a subject which is of extreme importance i want to commend him for the diligence in which he has pursued a subject that is every bit of importance to our country as he has indicated that it is and he makes a lot of sense and this is one member that l6oks forward to working with him in the days ahead in this very important area what i have taken this hour for and i will be joined by several of our blue dog colleagues is to once again talk about perhaps a little more mundane subject the budget of the united states and the policies or lack thereof a lot of what the gentleman from pennsylvania has talked about some of the shortcomings of the congress and the administration in dealing with russia i think can also be said of this body in dealing with the budget today i guess we had a little ceremony in which we have now sent the tax cut down to the president which with our childrens and grandchildrens he will veto as he should one of the future instead of once again rewarding policy objectives that the blue dogs us as this tax cut would do over the have suggested all year long is let us be next 10 years we say use this opporconservative with our actions now as tunity to pay down the debt so that our we enjoy the newness of dealing with children and grandchildren will not surpluses have as much debt to pay andas much we are for cutting taxes let no one taxes to pay in order to pay the inter be mistaken about that but the blue est on that debt dogs have suggested all along that we think that makes a lot of sense there is a good wayand a bad way to unfortunately we have not been able get to tax cutting the bad way we be to convince a majority of the house lieve is what the house and senate and the senate concurring thatit does concurring have said to the president make sense and we understand and we of having a tax cut with projected sur play by those rules and we also verypluses that may or may not mate strongly played by the rule that said ifrialize one is going to be critical of the other what the blue dogs have said quite guys proposal they better have someclearly all year long let us deal with thing that they are for the people social security and medicare first let back home in the 17th district that i us have an open andihonest debate on represent that iswhat they demand of the floor of the house with the best me ideas winning as to how we fix social as we have discussed and asked the security for the future because every question over and over what do you one now knows and admits quite pub want to do with thissurplus most peolicly that the future of social security ple openly and honestly say pay down is bleak unless we this congress make the debt some tough decisions and very very i do not know why different members soon get different answers to this question we ducked on that one and i must except sometimes we ask it differently say that our president ducked on that if i ask the question do you want to one which was unfortunate just be have a tax cut or do you want us to cause the president ducks is no sign spend the money you say tax cut that that we in the congress should duck would be my answer here at least some of us the gen then we get into another little probtleman from arizona and lem because we have hada whole lot of i and we have been joined by col rhetoric around this body over the last leagues on both sides of theaisle now several weeks now and we are still a few proposing a social security fix playing this giant game of chicken of that is not what i am here to talk who is going to blink first on the caps about tonight what i am talking who is going to be the first one to about tonight is the rhetoric that we admit that already this year we are continue to hear about why we need to spending the social security trust have a big tax cut first before we deal fund with social security before we deal now we have tried to outdo each with medicare before we deal with other as to who has the best lockbox medicaid before we deal with these who is going to do the best job of not very important subjects touching social security trust fundsthese are projected surpluses and one next year well i would say to my colof the dangers that some of us see parr leagues let me share a little secret we ticularly the blue dog democrats and have already done it this congress has i suspect there are some on both sides already dipped into the social security of the aisle that see the same danger trust fund no matter how we want to spending a projected surplus before it score it it has already happened little is real can get very dangerous just like things like declaring the census an in families if they have built up a debt emergency 4 billion conveniently on their credit card or personal debt to using omb scoring when it suits our where it is becoming difficult to pay purpose of being able to score spending the interest on that debt and suddenly 16billion cheaper come into some money most families i used to work with my friends on the will pay down their debt first before other side of the aisle quite regularly they go out and reward themselves on this argument when we finally got with a new car or reward themselves around to sayingour scorekeeper is the with new options congressional budget office the that is not what the congress has white house has the office of managevoted to do that is not the issue ment and budget we have the contoday gressional budget office it is biparto those that say well we are only tisan it is our scorekeeper let us quit returning your money to you that is fussing about whose numbers and true but they conveniently overlook whose projections we are going to use one fact not only is it your taxes that let us agree on the congressional we talk about and every dime that we budget office spend is your money but also your every once in awhile we would say debt of 5 6 trillion that we have built where there is differences why do they up 4 trillion of it basically in the last not just add up the two and divide by 10 years 15 it is your debt two and take an average and that bethe blue dogs suggest that now is comes something that we can use that the time to be a little bit conservative is consistent well by conveniently thus far using 16 billion of omb scoring it allows us to spend money well this might help us on the budget caps debate but it does not change the bottom line when we finish the year any spending for any purpose whether it is an agricultural emergency which we have whether it is the health care emergency that we have in rural america whether it is the shortchanging of home health care which we are doing under current law unless we change it all of these spending decisions are going to be real dollars so somehow some way i hope that we can find a way to accept what the gentleman from texas and i and if the gentleman from texas does not get over here i have a statement that i want to put in for him and if some of our colleagues who are perhaps here and are going to be joining us soon we the blue dogs are both extending our hand to both the leadership of the house and to the president of saying take another look of what we propose and how we propose it and if they do not like what we are talking about perhaps there is some compromises that can be reached one thing we feel very strongly about that we should not spend projected surpluses for any purpose until they materialize if they do and we pay down the debt to me and to us the best tax cut we can give all of the american people is to reduce the debt sufficiently that the federal reserve is convinced that we will maintain fiscal responsibility in our spending habits and instead of increasing interest rates over the next several months as they have done twice in the last month month and a half if we can bring interest rates down we know that a 1 percent reduction in the interest rate that affects student loans credit card bills home mortgages car auto loans all of the things that all of working america use every day it is estimated at 200 billion to 250 billion a year why is that so difficult for our colleagues who continue to believe that the best tax cut is the one that they send to the president of which he is going to veto i do not understand we do not understand that to those that suggest spending let me make this suggestion and this is a blue dog suggestion this has been in our budget proposal all year let us all acknowledge the fact that spending caps have worked we the last two three four congresses have done a fairly responsible job in reducing discretionary spending in fact we went a little too far in the area of defense and we are now having to put some of it back because this is no longer a safe world and we heard the gentleman from pennsylvania talking about a little different component of that the caps have worked but why is it so difficult to admit that perhaps what we did in 1997 in which most people acknowledged then that it was going to be difficult to make those cuts because we back end loaded it what does that mean in plain english it said congress in 1997 chose not to make the tough decisions we punted it to the 1999 congress that is why we are having such a difficult time why do we not go back and do it the way we used to do it around here 2 years ago 3 years ago 5 years ago 10 years ago why do we not go back and have a new set of budget caps on appropriation bills that are set and will be agreed to by a majority on both sides of the aisle of what the new spending restraints ought to look like as i answered a businessmans question earlier today in another meeting i was in he said when in 1997 when the congress did what you did the markets reacted favorably because they believed that you were going to get a fiscally responsible congress for a change and markets react to that and i said there is no reason why we cannot do that again we can do the same thing again we can have a new set of caps that we live with that will get us on track why is it so difficult for us to do let me pause right now and recognize one of my colleagues the gentleman from texas for any comments that he might like to add at this time"], [0.0029172301292419434, 0.9970827698707581, 1, "i yield myself 20 minutes i would very much like to see members get home for thanksgiving but i think my public duty is to help members understand what they are going to be voting on before they go home because otherwise when they do go home their experience with the news media and angry constituents is not going to be a very pleasant one and i am afraid there are a lot of nasty surprises in this bill some of which i will be discussing over the next 12 to 15 hours let me say first of all that this bill has been a battleground about national priorities and national direction it has been the arena for battles between the president and his allies on one side and his political opponents on the other by any measure i think it is safe to say that the president has won victory after victory we are going to be stuck having to extend the government i am afraid several times through crs like this one because of some of the decisions made in the bill that is coming next and people need to understand how they interrelate i think you can say for instance that in the area of international leadership the president and those of us who agree with him have won a great victory in funding the wye peace process agreement we have won a very important battle in making sure that debts that would never be repaid are going to be wiped out so that latin america and africa can in fact become good markets for our products as well as stable neighbors in an ever more complicated world we have won the fight to at least for now take the unitedstates off the list of u n deadbeats on the environmental front the president has beaten down virtually every antienvironmental rider that was tossed his way in the fight against street crime the president won 50 000 new cops on the education front it is important to understand some of the major achievements that we have made we have seen a lot of people denigrate the presidents effort to prbvide for 100 000 new teachers i want to put that effort in context what democrats have been fighting for on education in this package is a fourpronged researchbased attack on educational incompetence and poor performance the research shows for instance that children do much better in smaller classes that is why the president fought so hard for and won the battle for 100 000 new teachers that research also shows that especially at the high school level students perform better they exhibit less antisocial adolescent behavior and there is far less violence in high schools that are smaller and so we have an initiative that will provide for smaller high schools or at least to help local school districts build smaller learning centers within their high schools the research also shows that students do best when their teachers are welltrained it sounds obvious but some people seem to have missed it so we have an initiative in this bill that will add additional funding for partnership grants between university schools of education and local school districts so that those schools of education are producing the kinds of teachers that the districts actually need and also in the process we are trying to raise the standards for those teachers so that they are actually getting a degree in the subject that they are going to wind up teaching also i guess a shocking idea in some quarters and lastly research also shows that if you want to reform schools you need to do it from bottom to top and around again that reform has to be comprehensive systemic and that is why this bill adds additional money to the obeyporter bipartisan comprehensive school reform package all of those are very good things i say that there is no doubt on the major issues that have divided us the last 3 months the president has run the table he has won on issue after issue but i think there are some things that are just as important as winning and losing and i want to talk about some of them as we discuss this continuing resolution we are being asked to continue the government a few more days so it gives us time to pass the next bill that is coming at us i think we need to understand what is in that bill before we vote on this resolution there are many things in that package that disturb me the protractqd battle to persuade the majority to allow the united states to pay its back dues to the united nations has resulted in a compromise that may still prevent release of all of the funds that are needed to return the unitedstates to a position of good standing in the u n i think that is regrettable the republican majority was also steadfast in its refusal to provide the justice department with the 14 million that they need to pursue tobacco litigation this money is needed for efforts to recover the hundreds of billions of tax dollars paid through the medicare trust fund the public health service the veterans and military medical systems and the social security disability fund in dealing with tobaccorelated illnesses the tobacco companies that lied repeatedly to the american people about the health effects of smoking should pay a substantial portion of those costs the republican majority is clearly trying to protect them from having to repay the taxpayers i believe funds will be found by the administration to initiate litigation but as everybody knows legal outcomes are often dictated by the relative size of legal war chests that is one of the things for instance that i am told cbs news had to take into account when they discussed whether or not to put on that famous 60 minutes special which went after the tobacco companies for not telling the truth i would say that while the appropriation requested by th~e justice department to augment their ability to pursue that issue is small the longterm fiscal impact on the federal government could be enormous and we have failed to recognize that in the bill that is coming to us the republican majority also repeatedly refused to include language that both the white house and i asked them to include to ensure that 100 percent of the money paid from the medicare and social security trust funds is returned to those trust funds if it is recovered in litigation that item was repeatedly raised during negotiations it is the fair thing to do with those funds i find it hard to construct an argument that they should be used for a different purpose but the republican leadership flatly rejected that concept in both the senate and the house 0l 1315 i think the reason and this was even said in conference they did not want to approve this language is because it would provide incentives to proceed with the lawsuit well we ought to proceed with that lawsuit i think nothing more clearly underlies or underscores the hollowness of the claim of the majority that they have suffered a recent conversion and are now strong supporters of social security nothing is more clearly underscoring of the hollowness of that claim than their newfound concern over the solvency of those trust funds it is a concern that suddenly emerged around here after labor day when polling data demonstrated to them how badly they had been damaged by their attempts to pass a huge tax bill that rewarded the rich using all of the resources needed to strengthen social security and medicare another issue at the center of negotiations was whether to include a small acrosstheboard cut this cut was not necessary to reach the offset targets to make sure the bill was paid for more than enough money was available from other sources it is simply an attempt by the majority to create a symbol that could be used to pretend that in the midst of this orgy of gimmickry in spending that they are continuing to be fiscally responsible if my colleagues take a look at the dollars being provided across the board by the majority it is apparent it is apparent to me that the republican leadership is willing to spend almost any amount to get out of town just so long as we can obscure how much that really is through accounting gimmicks i think that is a big mistake the problem with an acrosstheboard cut is that people say my god any agency head ought to be able to administer a half a percent cut across the board of course they could they could easily find waste if they are left to their own devices but that is not the way this acrosstheboard cut is designed their acrosstheboard cut completely abandons the core responsibility of congress to determine spending priorities there are programs that could afford a 1 or 2 or even 10 percent cut but instead the congress requires much more limited authority be given to the president and that means that this congress ignores the fact that there are some programs that require a precise amount of money in order to protect the taxpayers interest those kinds of programs fall into two categories one to protect public safety and the other to control the inflow and outflow of public funds these are largely accounts that include things like the fbi the drug enforcement administration the air traffic control customs service and border patrol numerous studies have demonstrated that cuts in the administration of the social security agency can drive up the error rate in the disbursement of those funds enough to cost the federal government as much as 6 for every dollar saved in reduced expenditures in social security administration and yet those studies are ignored in the way this cut is applied then we get to the question of national defense the way national defense is treated in this acrosstheboard cut is very interesting it was treated the way this bill treats it in order to protect congressional pork so what the provision requires is that we will have to see about a 520 million reduction in operation and maintenance accounts which is the core of our military readiness and that is occurring at the same time that the pentagon reported that two out of the 10 divisions in the unitedstates army are now rated at c4 in other words not close to having the parts people and maintenance that are necessary to undertake military action yet operation and maintenance is going to be required to be cut by a larger percentage than anything else in this bill the reason for that is because the folks who put this bill together wanted to protect the projects and the pork in the research and procurement accounts so we get that weird anomalous result i will insert in the record at this point extraneous material related to my remarks and i will expand further on that subject for the record"], [0.003055870532989502, 0.9969441294670105, 1, "i want to take this opportunity to thank my democratic colleagues for joining me here today to talk about one of the most vital issues that faces this congress i think and certainly this country over the next several years and that is education so that you and others will not think that i am just standing talking about education because i have found in this great deliberative body called the peoples house we talk about a lot of issues and we can talk endlessly on issues if someone will provide us data but prior to my being elected to the peoples house in 1996 i served 8 years or two terms as the elected state superintendent of schools in my home state i have made education a top priority public education for our children not only at the state level but i have done that also since i have been here in congress throughout my service as superintendent and to this day as a member of congress i have spent a great deal of time in the classrooms of the schools of my state to observe firsthand the exciting educational innovations that are taking place in my home state i would say that is true all across america as my colleagues join me this afternoon i trust they will talk about some of the exciting things that are happening in their state also too many times all we do is we talk about the problems and it is important to acknowledge we have shortcomings and that we work on those shortcomings to make them better because young people only have one chance to get a good education in their first 12 years and so it is throughout the rest of their lives but sometimes it is important to acknowledge our successes as well as our shortcomings recently i had the opportunity to visit a school in wake county which happens to be the largest county in my district and that also is the capital city county the school i went in was conn elementary and it is really now called conn global communications magnet elementary school that is a mouthful but what it really means is that these young people are wired through the internet and through a special innovative program that the leadership in that county has put together in a partnership with the federal government to do some creative and exciting things for these young people they really are on the cutting edge of education reform in america the buzzword in washington these days is accountability i would say to you as strongly as i possibly can that an effective accountability or assessment mechanism is absolutely essential to sustain educational achievement and i will talk about that later on today as i talk because we have done that in north carolina on a statewide basis but now let me continue to talk about conn elementary because they can teach us here in washington a great deal about this whole issue of accountability and what you do to excite and energize young people and make them really love school all over again and love this thing we call learning let me share with my colleagues and read if i may the mission statement of conn elementary school let me say that conn is not an exception in my state of a school having a mission statement every school has one conn global communications magnet elementary school will prepare students for successful citizenship in a global society the learning environment created at conn will provide an educational experience that will emphasize heightened communications skills via reading writing mathematics science technology and the arts as a means of connecting and interfacing with the world i would read that again but let me just paraphrase it very quickly to say they understand that education is broader than what some have said reading writing and arithmetic it has gone long past the three rs there are a lot of other things that need to be interfaced and integrated in a good soufid public education these days conn will ensure success for all students underlined all students not just the bright students not just the students that come from parents who have money not just from parents who have the time to interface and work with the schools but all students now let me share with you why they say that and how they get to that point because i think it is important to as we emphasize that this innovative public school focuses on achieving for all their students and how they do it to achieve these goals conn has set out the following expectations for their students and yes for their staff and for the parents motivational global studies will accomplish a narrowing of the achievement gap between minority and nonminority students this is true not only in my state it is not just true in conn it is true in every school in this country how do we narrow that gap between those students who are achieving at a high level and those who are not and how do we make sure they all achieve at a much higher level because we need all of them participating in this new economy of the 21st century cultural diversity will provide opportunities for children to recognize and appreciate the value of cultural differences in their own communities and beyond let me tell you why that statement is so important we have the most diverse population in our public schools today we have had in the history of this republic yet there are those who want us to believe that we can educate the same way we have educated historically that is absolutely not true we have to recognize the cultural diversities and backgrounds from which our children come accept those and then help them achieve at a high level that may mean that they need more time on task in some areas than others and it may mean that they need smaller class sizes this congress is going to be about that and i will talk about that more in just a moment technological resources will enable students to communicate with the world around them many times when we talk about technology some of us talk about technology as if it were just a computer that is not the whole view of the issue computers are just one piece of a total mass communication world that we live in that children must have access to in our public schools if they do not have access to that total view of technology how in the world can we expect them to walk out of school one day and engage and interface in a world that is changing so rapidly we talk on this floor of the house about the changing world and talk is awful cheap it is easy to talk about changing education and making it better i have often said money is not the only issue but the last time i checked without a certain amount of money very little happens even though here at the federal level we only put in about 7 percent of the resources that our public schools use we can have a tremendous impact if we will encourage provide leadership help and be a partner because we are a partner we are not the senior partner but we are a major partner and we ought to be a partner that is about helping rather thari throwing impediments anywhere along the way communication skills will be the key to meaningful connections between students education and their understanding of individuals groups and countries now understand when i use this this is a special school that has access to the internet and other things that a lot of schools do not have every school should have this but it gives them a chance to understand what they are about integrated projectbased learning will ensure active participation and indepth understanding of global concepts when we talk about education sometimes many of us talk about education in the framework of our own background of how schools were when we were in school if we have not been in the classroom in the last 10 years and we go in and visit we would recognize the school we would recognize the hallways we might even recognize the classroom but i will guarantee you if you look at the curriculum and the things that a lot of teachers are doing in these creative classrooms it would sure be different integrated projectbased learning will ensure active participation and indepth understanding of global concepts i want to repeat that because i think that is important as we move in this world economy we stand on this floor and we talk about the issues of trade we talk about the issues of money moving et cetera all this is in the perspective of the world that has changed in the last 10 years with global communication lower studentteacher ratios will encourage more active involvement in the learning process more developmentally appropriate teaching differentiation of instruction and focused applications to improve student performance the last bullet i read is so important to this whole concept of what we talk about when we talk about total education for every child so that it is geared to that student that that student understands what is expected that teachers have class sizes small enough that they can deal with in a diverse population that we have when a teacher has to go in the classroom and have 30 students it is a very very difficult task when the range is so great with those students i have said many times my wife and i have three lovely children of whom we care very deeply and i love them dearly but i would be less than honest if i did not say today it would be very difficult if we had 30 of them and we were trying to instruct them around the house and to direct traffic i think that is true in most households too many times we ask our teachers to do the impossible task of doing what we could not do what we would not do and yet we talk a lot and i have often said when it comes to education we all have lots of answers and very few solutions in the political arena we need to become better partners as those partners we need to be sort of like the managing partner we are willing to help where we can and push where we need to and be less critical of the children and teachers who i think are working awful hard let me close on conn elementary with one other point and then i am going to yield to one of my colleagues this vision is a prescription for excellence for conn elementary and really for education in wake county i think that would be somewhat true of all the schools in my state of north carolina conn is a richly diverse inner city magnet school and they really are laying a foundation for lifelong learning and citizenship for these students in a situation where in many cases we would say those students could not do it they are measuring up and they are achieving at very high levels and they are closing the gap between minority and nonminority students they are doing it because teachers care students are focused parents are engaged and they are also disaggregating data for both minority and nonminority students let me tell you what i mean when i say disaggregating because so many times we talk about averages average students very few of us are average we are special in our own way if you take that data and break it down in individuals and individual groups pretty soon you will find out which student really needs the help where you need to give more time for math where you need to give more time for reading all of us learn differently and at different levels and conn elementary is doing that to make sure that every child reaches their full potential to meet the needs they are making sure that some of these students have smaller class sizes and they can only do it my colleagues because they have some additional money in a partnership with the federal government and the state is putting some extra in it that is why i say when you say it does not take extra money we are deceiving ourselves and misleading the public it takes additional dollars with that i yield to the gentleman from texas who really does understand how important it is how important education is to the future of this country he is close to it not only has he been a fighter here in congress but every weekend when he goes

april 15 that is the tax day before i begin these remarks indepth i want to make a couple of thank yous first of all i want to thank all of the american taxpayers i want to thank those taxpayers who are honest i want to thank those taxpayers who go out every day of the week and they work hard to earn money and they pay their proportionate share of taxes so that this country can remain great i want to thank those taxpayers who make sure that they file their tax returns on time i want to assure the taxpayers of this country that there are a number of us on both sides of the aisle there are a number of us who are devoted to making government more efficient and making government work for you the concept of this government is not the taxpayers working for the government but the government working for the taxpayers i am employed and all of my colleagues here on the floor we are employed by the taxpayers of this country it is the taxpayers to whom we respond it is the taxpayers to whom we owe a fiduciary duty to run this government in the most efficient way that we can possibly do it i can say despite all the rhetoric that we have heard about tax cuts can you or can you not have them if we could just on a uniform basis cut the government waste that we see in day to day operation within this government we could cut the taxes across the board a permanent tax cut of course every time we cut waste back here in washington we are getting into somebodys pocket because that money is not just put into a hole in the ground it goes to somebodys benefit what they tend to do in washington d c is build a wall to protect that benefit even though it is a waste of taxpayers dollars i want to say another thank you that is thank you for the services that are being rendered as we speak by our men and women in uniform not only in kosovo and in the region over in the balkans but throughout the entire world when we take a look at what our military people make for pay we will see why tax day is a tough day on them it is a tough day on a lot of americans that make that kind of salary but these people are dedicated and they are showing their strength and the dedication and the patriotism toward this country not only in kosovo in the military mission that we are engaged there but in korea in somalia throughout the united states and canada we have troops throughout the world and i want to say thank you to them tonight as well along with the thank you to our service people i also want to come back to the taxpayer and thank you for helping us finance these soldiers for helping us get them the best and most technologically advanced equipment in the world taxpayers you have a lot to be proud of this evening and it is now our duty our continuing duty and a number have tried to do this but it is our continuing duty in appreciation to the sacrifices you make by sending this government money to fund it it is our duty to make sure this government in turn gives you a bang for the buck you deserve it it is your money you will hear some people say well the government spends its money that is government money back in washington d c it is not government money it is your money it comes out of your workday every day of the week it comes every time you go to the cash register you pay taxes we will go into a little more of that let us start with the taxpayer and the american worker we all get a paycheck i thought we could just kind of break down a typical paycheck i asked someone in my office if we could use their paycheck stub we have taken the name off as can be seen but let me just point out a couple of things here this particular individual has a gross income of 1 958 33 deducted from that is a retirement amount for the retirement account of 195 83 this particular taxpayer is a vqry responsible taxpayer because they are helping fund their future retirement it is a mistake for the workers of this country for all of us in this country and most of us are workers in this country for us to figure out or to depend on the government to provide our retirement for us i think it is fair for us to depend on the government to provide a partial retirement through social security because we fund social security as does this taxpayer and we will look at social security here in a little more depth but we also have a responsibility we have personal responsibility to plan for those years in which we will not be employed the golden years of our life when we will not be in the workforce it may be by choice and where we are going to have a retirement do not expect the government to do it we have personal responsil ility most people i talk to accept that personal responsibility so does this taxpayer they put 195 a month aside for their retirement and some evening i am going to come over here and visit a little about why i think the government retirement system works pretty efficiently for all government employees and what i think we can do with social security to track along the same kind of systemthat we have for retirement for two or three million federal employees and i think we will see the benefits and why that system works this evening we are going to continue to stay focused on the taxes so then go to the adjusted gross the key down here that i want to take a look at is social security 149 82 now i want to talk briefly about social security and the kind of challenges that we face in the future about social security now why is social security in trouble we have often heard that social security is in trouble because the government has borrowed from the social security funds to use that money in its general funds well that is true but let us not focus on that this evening because if the government paid back every penny of every dollar that they borrowed from the social security funds and by the way the government is going to have to i mean the government on the bottom line is obligated to do this they are going to have to produce that but even that said if they paid it all back social security still faces challenges financial challenges in the future what brought on these financial challenges well first of all some good news the good news is because of the medical technology in the greatest country in the world our country the united states of america people now can expect to live to a later age when social security first came in in 1940 when people retired at age 65 they could expect to live 12 more years 12 more years that is 77 that was the average expectation today we can expect to live another 17 years beyond that point in time by the year 2030 so i think it is very reasonable to expect that my children and my grandchildren although i do not have my grandchildren but my expected grandchildren at some point will live well up into their hundreds and probably beyond their hundreds so we have good news life expectancy has gone up but social security premiums have never really been adjusted to allocate for that at some point we will have no choice but to raise the retirement age which by the way can be done pretty harmlessly over a long period of time to allocate for this or raise the premiums i think of course the fairer way to do it is do it kind of on an almost hold harmless over a period of time raising the age limit let me go on and talk about the other issue that we have got here with social security and that is that social security has kind of become a payasyougo today the average couple on social security draws out about 118 000 out of the system more than they have put into the system we cannot have a system that operates like that for a very long period of time so we have to figure out what benefits are going out what money is coming in what kind of adjustment we need to make for the extended life span the other problem of course that we have is that when social security first came around i am trying to remember the exact number but i think the ratio of recipients was something like 13 or 15 to 1 in other words when social security came there were 15 people working for every person retired today that has changed today it is 3 4 we have 3 workers out there for every person retired in the not too distant future we are going to have two people working for every person retired we have to stand up and face the social security we have done that in part the republicans specifically have put in place a lockbox to lock money for the future of social security that all said and talking about the problems of social security let me say what has gone right about social security number one the checks go out every month i cannot believe some of the propaganda that has been going out there to the general public saying oh your social security is going to be cut off you can tell it is political season when we hear statements like that i can tell members today without exception without condition that everybody on social security today faces nothreat of losing that social security check their check will continue to come in fact the people in my generation which is the generation behind the retired folks today that generation as well there is money in there to fund that generation the generation we have to worry about are my children those people that are say under 20 years old today or under 25 years that is the generation that we have an obligation to plan for at that point in the future however up to that point in time do not let politicians or do not let other people try and propagandize that we are going to lose our social security checks my gosh our seniors have enough to worry about when they reach that age to get that fear we sell a lot by fear take a look at the y2k program if people are like me they get mail every day trying through fear to get us to buy their product trying to get around y2k they do the same thing with social security we should not let them throw that fear factor into us when we see them throwing that fear into senior citizens saying you are going to lose your social security the republicans do this to social security it is not going to happen the money is there today for social security recipients it is there tomorrow it is 25 years from now that we have to plan for we frankly on the republican side and i am proud of this i am not trying to be partisan here i am trying to say it is a priority in our republican conferences it is good to see us talking about the future instead of just trying to handle the problems that come in today we are trying to plan for the future 25 years out 25 years out that is what a lot of people in fact the person who has this check is trying to plan their future 25 years out with this retirement here this 195 83 that is positive social security is positive the lockbox is positive i think the person with this check right now with the threelegged approach one the retirement that they have that they put aside with their employment two the retirement or investments they plan on their own and three social security i think people will be able to comfortably retire in this country for some time to come we are always going to find the exceptions but in general i think people can feel pretty good about social security but that does not mean that does not mean that we do not need to plan for the financial woes that will occur if we do not adequately address them today about 25 years from now let us go on to the federal tax what this person pays in federal tax 231 25 their health insurance again good planning by an employee let me step back it is amazing how manypeople in this country are offered health insurance by their employer but they opt not to take it this particular employee is taking the health insurance that is a wise investment that is a smart investment regardless of what people think whether we should have nationalized health which i strongly oppose by the way but regardless of where we think we should be with health care until that is resolved i think it is pretty smart to take out a health insurance policy that is what is occurring here here is the federal tax 231 25 i want us all to consider we have a pretty healthy economy today when things seem to be going well people tend to downplay the burden that we the taxpayers are actually carrying here once again i think we owe taxpayers appreciation they are funding the government the government is not running as efficiently as it should for them but i think they are doing more than their share the honest taxpayers out there by sending the money this way by funding this government so we owe this accountability let us take a look at the tax burden on americans i have been reading a lot of editorials especially this week april 15th tomorrow is taxpayer day that is the day we have to drive to the postal system and drop it in the mailbox i have heard a lot of people say hey the taxes are not so bad it is because times are good but we should not let it sneak up on us in world war h1 was when we had our highest tax in 1944 pretty understandable in a war 20 9 percent then in 1945 it actually dropped to 20 4 percent but compared to what it is today in the year 2000 under the clinton budget it would be 20 7 percent so it goes right in since 1944 it would be the second highest tax rate total tax rate that we would have i do not think the taxpayer should be paying that much in taxes i think we have a lot of efficiencies out there in government that can be realized let me say i think that philosophy is shared by the way by members on both sides of the aisle unlike some people who come to this podium just to attack attack the other party i think there are people in both parties trying to get some accountability trying to get a more efficient government but i am not a keen supporter i can tell the members right now of this budget right here that would put us in at about 20 7 percent after we pay those taxes that we showed in the previous poster we need to take a look at what else we pay taxes on first as we saw this particular taxpayer had the deduction taken out of their check so that is what goes to the federal government they also had and i did not show it on the tax stub they also had in there a deduction for state income tax let us take a look at the average day when we wake up in the morning generally we sleep in an apartment or a house and we have property taxes we pay for so so far we have federal taxes state taxes now we have property taxes if we turn on the lights in the house when we get up in the morning we have utility taxes so now we have federal taxes state taxes property taxes and utility taxes then we go to get something to eat we pull a bowl out of the cabinet we pull a coffee cup out of the cabinet and we have sales taxes we have paid sales taxes it is interesting i have a lot of young people that come to my office i take great delight and by the way this generation this new generation we have these kids are terrific they are bright they are capable when i talk to them in my office i say do you pay taxes it is surprising a lot of them say no not yet not like our parents but we probably will when we go to work i say no you pay taxes every time you go to the store no matter how old you are you pay a sales tax so now what we have we have federal income tax we have state income tax we have property tax we have utility tax and now we have sales tax on top of the sales tax of course then we drive our cars to work take a look at our gasoline tax i know in colorado in colorado i think it is 22 cents not think i know the state is 22 cents and the federal government charges 18 cents that is 40 cents per gallon it was not very long ago it was not very long ago that gasoline in glenwood springs or in colorado was about i dont know a dollar a gallon i called my friend today al stroobants over on the western slope and i called bill vollbraught my friend in denver and asked him what is the price of gas it has gone up a little for the sake of easy calculations lets talk about a dollar per gallon when we stop at the gas station for every dollar we pay the attendant here is a dollar for my gas bill we get 60 cents worth of gas we pay 40 cents in taxes take that out for every 10 we pay the gas attendant for the 10 bill on the gas pump for that 10 we get 6 of gasoline and 4 of taxes so where are we so far we have federal taxes state taxes property taxes utility taxes sales taxes gasoline taxes then what we do we go and have a friend lets say that comes to visit us or take a flight from the airport go out to the airport then there are passenger taxes and other fees we have fees to do this fees for a rentacar taxes to get on the airplane then if you decide when you fly to your destination you want to stay in your hotel you have a hotel tax that is put on top of that then finally if you get a little depressed about the whole thing and you decide to without driving by the way without driving you decide to have a beer you are going to pay a tax on alcohol and take a look at what the percentage of that is then if you are unfortunate and you happen to pass away with too much property then the government is going to put a death tax on you no matter what level of property that you have they still tax certain items in funeral preparations and other things like that involved with your death there are lots and lots of taxes in our society that is where we get to that overall tax burden which is among the highest in our countrys history do not let it creep up on you do not let these increased taxes creep up on you when the economy is good that is when people seem to pay the least amount of attention to their taxes that is when the economy is good it creeps up on them take a look at special districts special districts have a special use in our country we need them especially in rural america but a lot of people never see what their special district taxes are because those are paid by the mortgage banker you send one check in a month just like my wife and i do we send our check in once a month to the mortgage company and the mortgage company then turns around and pays the school tax the cemetery district tax the library district tax the recreation district tax et cetera et cetera so those are even more taxes i am not up here bashing the fact we pay taxes we cannot have a government if we do not pay taxes what i am saying as this tax level begins to creep up and up you as the taxpayers you are our employers we work for you you have every right to demand efficiency and productivity from your government because you are paying those taxes you are paying them at every level when we go to the airport and pay a passenger tax we are entitled to have an airport that is efficient when we go and drive on a state highway or federal highway we have a right to expect a highway that is safe a highway that is wellengineered and a highway that is built with construction dollars that are done in such a way that it is competitive as i mentioned earlier i think we can be very very pleased about the efficiency and the dollars that are being spent on our soldiers over in kosovo i think they are doing a darned good job not just because of the fact that they are putting their lives on the line which of course is the most critical issue that we have facing us today but by gosh we are getting good delivery we have got very efficient forces over there in fact i know a family i will intercede this here steve and janet westhof i want to say hello if i get an opportunity to in the next couple of days but they have six kids six kids and five of them are in our military we can be assured that our taxpayer dollars we are getting our worth out of those five westhof kids that are serving out of colorado in the military let us go on and talk a little more about some of the tax breaks and things that i think are important how we calculate taxes it is just like when we are paying for some kind of service if you are paying for lawn service you are starting your lawn service this summer and you are paying for somebody to come mow your lawn you adjust that every year one year you may decide to have bushes trimmed in addition to the lawn mowed so it is going to adjust what you pay the next year if you decide to trim the bushes yourself then you should expect you are going to pay less to mow the lawn if you do not pay less but you are getting less services something is wrong with that formula you need to calculate what is going on right now in our government there are some efficiencies that we have realized there are some tax credits that are very significant once again as a republican i take a great deal of pride in the fact one we are going to have a budget tomorrow number two we have delivered significant tax cuts in the last couple of years i do not know how many of my colleagues out here and i assume most of them own their homes but take a look at this and again i am proud of it i am proud to be a republican i think we have done some very positive things not partisan positive things for the taxpayer out there what have we done the house if any members have sold a house this last year they need to go see their tax accountant make sure they have given that information to their tax accountant before those taxes are filed tomorrow because they may be entitled to one of the largest tax breaks they have received during their entire working career what do i mean by that first of all let us talk about the old rule if you sold your house for a net profit now remember on a house if you bought a house for 100 and if you were to sell the house it is only worth 100 but you have been paying on it for several years so you now only owe 50 on it so you sell the house for 100 but you have been paying 50 you only owe 50 on it you have 50 in your pocket after you sell the house that is not net income that is net equity net income would be if you bought the house for 100 you paid down 50 so you now have 50 that you owe on it but you sell the house for 150 you have 50 of equity and 50 of net income in the past the government has gone to that 50 of net income and they have taxed you on that there was one exception to it if you were 62 years of age or older you got a onceinalifetime tax exemption that one time of up to 120 000 the republicans changed that last year it was a republicanled plus this had bipartisan support some democrats voted for it but it is an important one what does it do let us take a look at before this tax bill before the republican tax bill let us take a look at what an individual and now most homes are owned by couples so let us look at the couple column which is right here where the red light is you buy the house this is before we changed the tax law you bought the house for 200 000 you sold the house for 700 000 so you have obviously recognized a large net profit your profit is 50 000 the income that would be taxed under the old law for a couple would be 500 000 what did we do we gave you an exemption that is good every 2 years not when you are 62 but you get it renewed every 2 years on your primary residence here is what the status is with the same house after the tax credit bill that we put in place last year a couple again they buy the house for 200 000 they sell the house for 700 000 again just like over here before the tax break they make 500 000 so they make 500 000 under either circumstance but look what the difference is hereis the column the income that will be taxed is zero zero here the income that would be taxed was 500 000 that is significant it will apply to every homeowner in this country whether you live in missouri or new york or colorado or california or alaska every homeowner in this country that sells their home for a net profit will get a tax benefit thanks to the hard work of the congress the hard work again i want to come back the hardest work is by the taxpayer which funds the congress but we are the managers of that money through the management of that money we have determined that those of you who own homes and that is most ofamerica deserve a break today when you sell your home for a net profit that is significant here is another tax break that i think is worthy of us looking at because this means millions of families across this country will have more dollar to spend more dollars coming back to you let us go again through the system of how the taxes work the money the government has is not created in washington d c it is created by your hard work by your contribution to capital by your sweat by working and showing up and working those 8 or 10 or 12 or 14 hours every day that is how money gets to government as you know it comes up through several different layers of government it means there are a lot of middlemen in the government that take a little here take a little there we need to make sure that we are operating in an efficient manner if we have excess cash we ought to give it back to you now excess cash is excess cash after we have planned for social security after we have planned for medicare and after we have planned to reduce the national debt remember it was not very many years ago we used to be mocked the republicans were laughed at when we stood up and told the american people we were not laughed at by the american people some maybe but we were laughed at by some of our political opponents who said we will never get rid of the annual deficit this government is always going to operate with a deficit we thought we could accomplish it by 2004 we actually accomplished it in 1999 that is pretty significant now we have got to take on the national debt but in doing that we have got to be fair to the people that pay the bill and that is you the taxpayers here is one of the things that we have done it is tough today economically to bring up a family even a family of four with the kind of needs that you have my gosh it is wonderful in america that we have the kind of opportunities that we do america is a darn good place to live i am proud to not only be a citizen of the united states to be here in america but i am proud to be a representative of the citizens of america but our families we want to allow our families to have as many things as they can have frankly even some of the families in worst shape are in the lower end of our standard of living here are still better off than a lot of the other countries in the world but the point is how do we get to the average family how do we get some dollars back to the average family so they have a little better opportunity at educating their young children at making sure their young children have the best or at least some good opportunities or good clothes good food good transportation a good home with good heat with good air conditioning those kinds of things what are some of the things that we could do we took a look at the tax credit that we gave for the sale of a home the beauty of that tax credit is most people use that to buy another home here we have what we call the child care credit a family of four under this tax credit if they have two children under age 17 they have 45 000 a year annual income and by the way there are a lot of people out there especially if both husband and the wife work outside the home 45 000 between the two of them is not unusual in 1998 we allowed a 400 per child credit that is a direct credit 400 per child in 1999 that will increase to 500 per child 500 per child the tax credit here before the republican tax credit went into place this couple that earned 45 000 family of four two children under 17 could expect on that income to pay approximately 5 134 after that tax credit they now pay 4 334 or 800 less to some people 800 is not a lot of money to me it is to most american families it is a lot of money one of the problems in government is if the people that work for you in government begin to become somewhat callous towards the value of money i have talked to people in government who say well what is 800 out there hey get out there and try and earn 800 bucks thatis a lot of money it means a lot to a family and it means a lot to a family of four and it means a lot to a family with young children or to a family that is retired eight hundred dollars are big bucks and that is why these tax credits mean something i know in campaign season they always say well the republicans they give tax breaks to the rich rich is that what you call rich those people not all homeowners in this country are rich most families in this country are rich with love family love wehave lots of love we need more i amnot getting into the social issue here but the fact is most of the families that own homes in this country are not rich and that is who that tax credit goes to help most people in this country are not rich by those standards certainly by 45 000 a year standards that tax credit of 800 goes to help them these are not insignificant numbers the taxpayer is entitled if the circumstances warrant and which by the way a good economy has allowed that to occur a break today let us give them a break today let us go to our employers and say what you have been paying meis great but we think we have found some management efficiencies whereunder we can manage social security and make sure everybody continues to get their check and we are confident we can medicare will be secure we have a lock box we lock the money away we will be able to take down the national debt we are still going to have a littleleft for you a little left for you the very person that goes out there and works every day of the week or 5 days a week or whatever your work pattern is to make it possible so we have the money to run this government by the way run this government on your behalf let me once again mention kosovo and the situation we have got over there we have to come back to the american taxpayer we are not going to have to raise your taxes by the way to fund kosovo but this is a very very expensive operation i do not know one democrat and i do not know one republican that wants to cut our soldiers or our people in uniform regardless of where they are or our manufacturers that are supplying these products as long as they supply them on a fair value i do not know anybody on either side of the aisle that wants to short our military we may have disagreements on kosovo and i think they are significant disagreements on kosovo and the policy in the balkans and so on but policy is separate than the issue of support for our soldiers we will afford we will pay for and we can pay for every weapon that our military soldiers need every meal every uniform every paycheck we can meet the needs of the american military but that money means that we have to do some more financial planning back here in washington d c it means that we will not be able to reduce the national debt at the same rate that we thought we could reduce it just a month ago it means that we have an emergency spending number in front of us what we have to congider is how far into the future that emergency spending dollar goes i am one of those people that happens to think that thic operation will not stop today at 3 billion i am one of those people that thinks that this operation costs us about 100 million a day and that we have many many many more days into the future to fund this operation this will be a significant cost item for you the taxpayer let us not clown around it is like having a meeting with your bosses we need to report it up front we have a very expensive item on the radar it is on the agenda right now it is kosovo it may not end when the bombing stops by the way because the united states one we have a strong sense of humanitarian belief to take care of the sick people to go in and assist where we can that is expensive number two if we maintain a peacekeeping force through the auspices of nato by the way the united states carries the biggest burden there and the united states usually carries the big burden i am proud of that on one hand and on the other hand it is kind of like going camping and having everybody gather firewood if you have got people that is capable or closest capable to you that is gathering firewood they ought to be out there gathering firewood if they want to sit by the fire but we have to constantly make sure everybody carries their fair burden but this kosovo situation can get expensive it is expensive right now we will fund it we have got the money to fund it but you need to be patient we all need to be patient and understand that our reduction of the national debt which is critical for the republican party and i think critical for many of my colleagues on the democratic party that the preservation of social security which is critical for all of us that the preservation of medicare which is critical for all of us that we are going to have to make some adjustments it does not mean they are going to be in trouble or that we are not going to be able to do what we had originally committed to do we are but it does mean we have an emergency expenditure out there and it is called kosovo let me talk about another tax that i think is very unfair the marriage penalty let me talk about a couple other taxes that are very unfair they are inherently unfair to me there is no justification for these types of taxes these are taxes that the taxpayer should not be paying because it is unfair to the taxpayer not that it is a heavy burden on the taxpayer it is but that it is an unjustified tax it is not right to tax people like we are going to tax them like the government has been taxing them one of them is the marriage penalty my gosh folks this is the united states of america this is a country where we think family is of the highest priority we encourage marriage in this country we encourage people to stay married in this country we know the statistics prove i do not care whether you are a conservative clear to the right or whether you are a liberal clear to the left the fact is the bottom line is we know that a married couple has a lot better chance of success at raising their young than does a single person it is just reality out there but yet the government despite the fact that we encourage marriage despite the fact that we know that married couples have much better odds of raising children and much less dropout rate et cetera et cetera et cetera despite the fact that we know all of this the government still continues to impose a marriagepenalty when it comes time to pay your taxes tomorrow so those of you who pay your taxes tomorrow which most of the people that we are talking about most of my colleagues here if you are married you pay an additional tax penalty because of the simple fact that you are married that does not make any sense it does not make sense to me ansi it does not make sense to you but we have a lot of people out there who are not even aware of the fact that we have a marriage tax penalty one of the big priorities of the republican conference this year is get rid of that marriage tax penalty we may be delayed if we spend a lot of money in emergency dollars those emergency dollars are justified and i want to make sure we get a good bargain on them but we know that a lot of those dollars are justified so it may delay it but as soon as we can afford to do it we need to get rid of that tax we need to get rid of the tax not just when we can afford it but because it is an unfair tax it goes contrary to the type of society we want to pursue we want a type of society where marriage is encouraged not where marriage is penalized it does not make sense what is the other tax that is unfair it is the death tax the death tax we are taxed when we die now granted there are exceptions to that we do not have to pay taxes if we have an estate up to 650 000 and that is moving up but take a look first of all at those people who do i do not care whether an individual is rich i do not care whether an individual is poor i do not care whether an individual is middle class no one should ever have to pay a tax that is unfair and if someone is paying a tax that is unfair even if it just affects the poor people the middle class and the wealthy people ought to be just as aggressive at getting rid of that tax that unfairly taxes the poor people with a lower standard of living and likewise the poorer income should be just as aggressive about taking away a tax that is unfair to the middle income and so on up the line if it is an unfair tax it is an unfair tax whether an individual makes minimum wage or whether an individual a million a year it is an unfair tax and that is what the death tax is all about now with the death tax are we taxing property that somehow has escaped taxation during the life of the person who earned that no not at all in fact we are taxing once again property that on many occasions has been taxed not only once not only twice but sometimes three and four times so what creates the death tax is simply the fact that a person has died and the reason it creates it is the government says hey old scotts gone so lets just go ahead and go after it that is a good legitimate reason to take money from our citizens they are dead they are not going to complain any more but my gosh realize what the ramifications are of this death tax take a look at the state that i am from i am from the state of colorado my district is the third congressional district most americans have been in my district if you have ever skied you have been in the third congressional district if you love beautiful mountains you have been in the third congressional district it is a beautiful area but it has a very heavy dependency on two things well on several things but two i want to talk about one small business and two agriculture now what do i mean by small business and agriculture with the values today as rapidly as they have increased in our healthy economy we find out that the best way to lose a small business is to die we cannot pass it on to the next generation because of the punitive taxes that they put on us despite the fact that we may have bought our business and grew our business with aftertax dollars in other words we have already paid the taxes at least once twice or three times we have a country that we should encourage people to be married we should not penalize them for being married we have a country that we should encourage one generation to pass on the small business to the next generation we should not discourage them we should not tax them out of it the government is not getting cheated the government is not getting cheated because people get married they are not getting cheated out of any taxes and the government is not getting cheated because somebody dies on property that the dead person when they were alive owned they are not getting cheated it is just another opportunity to grab more money out of our pockets what is the impact well first of all as i mentioned you cannot pass a business from generation to generation it is very difficult to do it now if you have a lot of money maybe you can buy the life insurance that is necessary to pay off the government pay them off and get the government off your back steps that is what it is it is a payoff to the government but a lot of small business people simply cannot afford that the other thing that colorado is heavily dependent on is agriculture we are very selfish with our land so to speak in colorado we want to preserve the land open space has become more and more critical to the citizens of colorado it is important for us to preserve our beauty we have to work a lot more in balance than perhaps was worked 20 or 30 years ago what we find ourselves in is a predicament land values have gone up in colorado they have gone up significantly well if you have a small family farm or a ranch and your land values have gone up it is highly likely highly probable that your ranch upon your death will not be able to be passed on to your son or your daughter but will have to be sold at the auction block to pay uncle sam i will give you an example i know a family i will not tell you the exact location but it is in the third congressional district of the state of colorado this fellow was a very hardworking man he came to colorado when he was about 18 years old he started as a bookkeeper in a construction company he worked his way up pretty soon he worked from being a bookkeeper into helping supervise construction he dug ditches but he soon was driving a truck and he had the books pretty soon he built that construction he and a partner into a successful construction company in a small town in colorado along the way this man and his partner found out that they were having trouble getting financing for their construction company so they decided well let us start a little bank a small bank this is not nations first or some other big bank let us start a little bank in our little community so they started this little bank in their community well that was probably 50 years ago about 8 years ago my friend decided to sell the bank and by then of course the bank had become a very strong small business it had grown they put a lot of sweat a lot of their own human capital into it and it has prospered so they decided to sell the bank and they sold the bank unfortunately within a very short period of time literally weeks after the bank was sold my good friend discovered he had terminal cancer then unfortunately he lost his wife three or four months later my friend passed away from terminal cancer what happened well he still had the stock in the construction company they sold the bank and they hit him with a capital gains taxation do you know what the effective rate of taxation was on that estate when you put capital gains tax which is complicated but a lot of you out there understand what i am speaking about and you put the death tax on top of it they went into this family to that man who had worked over 50 years with sweat and toil and put human capital into this investment the government went in there and the property that had already been taxed at least once probably twice or three times and imposed a 72 percent tax on the property now when i spoke with the family i asked them i said so all you had left in the estate was 28 percent because the government took 72 percent no they said we did not get 28 percent because the government came to us and said here is the tax 72 percent and by the way it is due within this period of time the only way that the family could come up with that money to pay off the government on property that had already been taxed but was now being taxed simply because their father had died the only way they could pay that off was to sell at a fire sale their assets their property selling it as quickly as they could otherwise they were going to be penalized by the government so the 28 percent did not really work out to 28 percent because they had to sell it under panic prices they told me they estimated they cleared about 13 percent of that estate thirteen percent of what that man had worked for that man and wife by the way the mother was a homemaker but she deserves as much credit here the money that couple had worked for for over 50 some years the little company they had built up the little bank they had built up the farmland that they had was all taken in one sweep by the government is that fair it is not a fair tax the death tax is not a fair tax and the death tax while it may apply to people that only have assets of 600 000 or more it impacts all of society and you cannot under any circumstances in my opinion justify going to a family that has already paid their taxes and force them to pay a punitive tax on top of that now has it impacted colorado sure what happens to the ranches if you have a ranch that has to be sold what is the highest and best use for ranch land in colorado well unfortunately for a lot of land in colorado especially in my district the third congressional district the beauty of it if it is no longer a ranch or a farm you can put condominiums on it build huge homes on it put it into fiveacre estates that is where the highest value of that land is move the water off the land i could talk 2 hours on water move the water off the land change the historical nature of that property and i think in most cases it changes for the worst it takes away our open space it threatens our open space it threatens generations of families being able to stay and raise their young in the mountains of colorado because of a tax imposed by the government that is unfair to start with well i think americans right now are paying a lot of taxes and i think that tomorrow on april 15 there are a few things we should consider and let me summarize number one everybody that works in the government ought to be thanking every taxpayer out there for funding it mr taxpayer mrs taxpayer young taxpayer old taxpayer you hear it right now thank you thank you for your hard work thank you for being willing to be one honest on your taxes two to pay your taxes and three to allow your government to work for you the second point i want to make to you we have an obligation back to you working as the government we have an obligation as elected officials as appointed people working for the government as employees of the government no matter how you classify it we work for you and we have an obligation to deliver the most efficient product we can on behalf of the government that works for you number three we have an obligation and the republicans are taking charge this is a priority for them to eliminate unfair taxation and we should start with the marriage penalty the marriage penalty no matter how we cut it no matter whether we are a democrat or a republican no matter what level we are the marriage penalty is an unfair tax and it has costs in society costs that are negative it is not a positive thing to look at marriage penalty taxes are unfair and they should be eliminated number four do not just let people dismiss death taxes as taxes for the rich it has an impact it has a ripple impact all the way down take a look at the open space in colorado and then take a look at the very premise for that kind of tax is it fair is it on property that has not been taxed the answer to that is no the death tax is a tax on property that has been taxed once twice or three times that tax should be eliminated it is not fair the death tax should not go straight to the government it is not right finally let me wrap it up with a few words once again thanking our soldiers who are serving us tonight wherever you are in the world to me the servicemen and women we have right now on the dmz in north korea south korea right on the dmz between south korea and north korea those are some pretty brave people up there men and women serving that duty throughout the world they are serving us i want you to know that with bipartisan support unified support i do not think there is a no vote in the body this body has voted to give a tax break we will vote tomorrow unanimously not one no vote from democrat or republican we will vote unanimously to recognize the service of these soldiers and give them a tax break they deserve it they are delivering for us you are getting a good product you are getting good and efficient service from our military today you may disagree with the policy i have got problems with the policy for example in the balkans that is what i am referring to specifically you may disagree with that but the fact of what those military people are doing will be observed tomorrow on april 15 with this bill that will give them some tax relief so i want to thank those people i am now ready to wrap up tomorrow is april 15 folks take a look at what you are paying in taxes we should pay taxes for the right kind of product but just remember as i conclude tonight that you have every right it is a fundamental right to look at the people that work for you that is the government the government works for you and demand from that government efficiency and a good product if you are not getting efficiency if you are not getting a good product then you should demand that you get your money back and if you are paying too much money for the product you are getting you are entitled to get your money back just the same as if you went to the grocery store and you overpaid there america to me is a very positive thing i am positive about our economy i am positive about our soldiers i am positive about the american people we have a lot to look forward to and in this country there is a lot more that goes right than there is that goes wrong but in order for it to work we have to be sure that we balance that payment from the taxpayer to the government"], [0.9985942244529724, 0.9985942244529724, 0, "i come to the floor again tonight to discuss the issue of illegal narcotics and the tremendous cost to our nation over and over again it is important that i think we repeat the message that i have with me here today and that is a simple one that drugs destroy lives and i believe if every member of congress takes a few minutes to look at the impact of illegal narcotics they will be absolutely startled as to the damage that it does to our society the cost to countless families across this nation and also the tremendous responsibility cast upon the congress to finance the social the judicial and other costs that illegal narcotics impose upon our society tonight i want to talk for a few minutes about some of those costs and tell the congress and the american people that there are some very specific and direct costs to illegal narcotics and what they have done to this nation and to again families and young people in fact during the past year over 14 000 americans lost their lives as a direct result of the misuse or abuse of illegal narcotics in this nation i come from a beautiful area in central florida my district is between orlando and daytona beach a very peaceful affluent high employment high income area even my area has been plagued with countless deaths in fact a recent headline in orlando sentinel newspaper blasted out that in fact the number of drugrelated deaths had now exceeded the number of homicides drug overdose deaths now exceed homicides in central florida so the statistics are not only bad in my area but across the nation with more than 14 000 and again we do not count in all of those that are in traffic accidents or in suicides or other unreported deaths that may have some other report of the demise of the individual which is not included in this 14 000 figure in 1995 we had almost 532 000 drugrelated emergencies which occurred across this nation and that figure has been on the upswing particularly among our young people which should be of concern again to every member of congress in 1995 we also have a figure that is reported of a retail value of the illicit drug business being over 49 billion the cost goes on and on again to our society across the land tonight there are over 1 8 million nearly 2 million americans incarcerated in our jails and prisons across the land this is at incredible cost the cost of the judicial system the cost of the lost wages the cost of social support for the families who have their loved ones incarcerated so the cost is not just 1 8 million people behind bars but in fact much greater cost it is estimated out of the nearly 2 million in our jails prisons and state facilities that 60 to 70 percent are there directly because of a drugrelated offense and these are not small offenses like possession of minor drugs and these are not one time or misdemeaxior occurrences or offenses these are in fact we find from the hearings that we have conducted with our criminal justice drug policy subcommittee these are in fact very serious felonies and most of those people behind bars again in studies confirm this as recently as the hearings that we held today in our subcommittee that these folks in most instances are violent offenders that in fact those that are there because of drugrelated crimes are there because they trafficked in drugs they committed a murder they committed a rape and an assault a robbery while under the influence of illegal narcotics or in the pursuit of acquiring money or drugs so again 2 million people behind bars is only the tip of the iceberg drugrelated illnesses in the united states and death and crime are estimated to cost americans some 67 billion plus a year in the united states this translates into very specific costs to every american who has to pay 1 000 a year to carry the costs of health care extra law enforcement car and automobile accidents and crime and lost productivity due to drug abuse and use eighteen percent of the 2 000 fatally injured drivers from seven states had drugs rather than alcohol in their systems when they died again drugs do in fact destroy lives and have a very specific cost impact to the american taxpayer to every american citizen in addition to just the incarceration cost and judicial cost drug use and misuse and illegal narcotics also dramatically impact the productivity of americas workers seventyone percent of all illicit drug users are 18 years of age or older and they are also interestingly enough employed in a study by the unitedstates postal service the data collected showed that among drug users absenteeism is 66 percent higher and health benefit utilization is 84 percent greater in dollar terms when compared against other workers so in fact the billions that we are talking about are only the tip of the iceberg when we translate this into lost productivity and absenteeism and then the overutilization of our health benefit programs again all of that does translate into extra costs for every citizen again drugs destroy lives they cost us lives and they cost every american in this congress dearly disciplinary actions are interestingly 90 percent higher for employees who are drug users as opposed to nonusers of drugs another high price tag to pay for those who are involved in illegal narcotics or in drug use let me talk tonight about how some specific drugs impact our society and young people in this nation and what the effects of some of these drugs are first of all let me talk about crack and cocaine the use and abuse of crack and cocaine which also destroys lives has somewhat evened out among the adult population that is only because now we have an incredible supply of heroin we have an unbelievable supply of methamphetamine so for example my area has a very substantial increase in heroin use and abuse and deaths and the midwest and some other areas have been impacted by methamphetamine so crack and cocaine has leveled out the supply availability and price of other drugs such as methamphetamines and heroin is available even firsttime crack or cocaine users can be subject to heart attacks which can be fatal we heard testimony today from a wonderful lady mrs bennett who testified before our subcommittee she lost her young son a firsttime cocaine user who suffered a fatal reaction and died at a very young age she brought his picture to our subcommittee which conducted a hearing on the question of decriminalization and legalization of illegal narcotics she will tell the members that drugs in fact destroy lives they destroyed the life of her son and this report that i have tonight about the use of crack or cocaine adding to your incidence of seizures or heart attacks is in fact very real even one hit of crack or cocaine can in fact kill one because it can cause heart attacks strokes or breathing problems this has medically been proven crack and cocaine use are also connected and abuse are connected to car crashes to falls burns drowning and suicide and sometimes again these go unreported but my point again is that illegal narcotics hard drugs like crack and cocaine do destroy lives the addiction we have not talked about but that can ruin the physical and mental health of so many individuals and often is not counted into the statistics that we report here so again we have an instance of one drug which has a devastating impact on so many lives and does in fact destroy lives the other drug i will talk about for a few minutes is heroin heroin users are getting younger and younger since 1993 the use of heroin among our teenage population has risen some 875 percent in the united states we have a tremendous supply of heroin coming into the united states we have a reduction in price i will talk in a few minutes about how we are getting that tremendous supply coming in but in fact the people who are most subjected to heroins deadly effects are our young people heroin users are getting younger a recent survey indicates that kids are trying heroin at younger and younger ages for example in 1995 this report that i have says that 141 000 people in america tried heroin for the first time about a quarter of these firsttime users were somewhere between the ages of 12 and 17 even worse more than half the people who were admitted to hospital emergency rooms for heroinrelated problems were under age 18 again the theme that we bring to the floor tonight is that drugs destroy lives and drugs destroy young lives in an incredible number of instances these statistics do indicate that we have a tremendous heroin abuse problem among our young people heroin is dangerous and you have to be just totally irresponsible to put yourself using it we have also found in our studies and hearings that the heroin that is coming into the united states in 1998 1999 today is not the heroin that came in 10 or 15 years ago the purity levels that were down in single digits are now 60 70 percent pure young people and adults who try heroin have very deadly results as i cited just in my local central florida district and area we now have heroin overdose deaths exceeding homicides that picture is being repeated over and over across the land in fact we are now up to over 4 000 heroin deaths in the nation and the number is growing every year most disturbingly again we see young people as the victims of heroin overdoses and heroin deaths drugs destroy lives again let me cite some of the information that we found in our hearings on our subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources over half the crime in this country is committed by individuals under the influence of drugs in the hearing that we held today we had tom constantine who is the immediate former director of our drug enforcement agency of the united states just retired in the last few days he told us that over half of the individuals who had been arrested for federal offenses are now testing positive for illegal narcotics we heard the sheriff of plano county the city of plano and that area testify before our subcommittee today he also indicated that a very high number of those arrested for any offense in his jurisdiction also have some drug in their system the national institute of justices adam the drug testing program it is referred to also as the adam testing program found that more than 60 percent of adult male arrestees tested positive for drugs it was interesting in some of the information we obtained today and this figure is very high for adult males but i believe the figure was 71 percent of the women who were arrested tested positive for drugs a startling statistic that although we have fewer female arrestees that a greater percentage of them are involved with illegal narcotics and have them in their system when they are tested upon arrest in most cities over half the young male arrestees are under the influence of marijuana importantly the majority of these crimes result from the effects of the drug and did not result from the fact that the drugs are illegal according to a study of the national center on addiction and substance abuse at columbia university 80 percent of the men and women behind bars about 1 4 million inmates are seriously involved with alcohol and other drug abuse i am going to try to refer a little bit later if we have time to the results of that report from the national center on addiction and substance abuse at columbia university this is an absolutely fascinating report just released this morning and it talks about marijuana it is the most comprehensive study ever conducted that highlights the critical distinction between nonmedical marijuana medical uses of marijuana and what is going on with those who abuse this substance and some incredible statistics about again the effect on those individuals and how many of them are now in some type of a treatment program and the problems that are related to this we will talk more about that the former secretary i believe of one of the administrations joe califano was involved he was a former hew secretary with this study he is now president of that organization we hope to have him testify at a future hearing on the results of their study again it is a dramatic study that does show that we have an incredible number of young people who are the victims of marijuana which many try to tout as a soft drug or a nonharmful narcotic but again all the studies the reports the information lead us to one simple conclusion again that drugs destroy lives according to a study published in the journal of the american medical association last year nondrug users who lived in households where drugs including marijuana are used are 11 times as likely to be killed as those living in drugfree households so if a young person or an individual comes from a house where drugs are being used this study by the american medical association said they increase their chances of being killed by 11 times so again these are more statistics that confirm that drugs destroy lives drug abuse in a home increased a womans risk of being killed according to this study by a close relative some 28 times so those that are concerned and we heard testimony today about spousal abuse an incredible statistic some 80 percent of the spousal abuse cases involved methamphetamines in one jurisdiction that was studied and that would be abuse battery assault of a woman a wife a spouse but in a home that has drug use a womans risk of being killed is increased by 28 times according to this ama study additionally to confirm again the message we bring tonight that drugs destroy lives i have a study by the parent resources and drug information center this is also referred to as pride the organization and this pride organization reported some of these facts of high school students who reported having carried guns to school and certainly there has been a great deal of talk about guns in this congress on the floor of the house of representatives this said students who were reported having carried guns to school 31 percent used cocaine compared to 2 percent of the students who never carried guns to school the same relationship was found among junior high school so more than likely the school violence and those involved with carrying lethal weapons such as guns to school are much more likely to be drug abusers drug users nineteen percent of gang members reported cocaine use compared to 2 percent among youths who were not in gangs so whether it is someone carrying a gun to school or someone involved in a gang drugs destroy their lives and in fact drugs contribute to the crime disruption of our public school system and education again drugs destroy lives today the subcommittee which i chair the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources as i mentioned earlier began another hearing to look into the question of drug legalization drug decriminalization we heard from a number of witnesses some on different sides of the issue i try to always bring in a balanced approach we heard one witness in particular in favor of legalization of marijuana a representative from the normal organization it is called we heard another individual report from a study who gave some of the comparisons that had been reviewed on marijuana use and we heard from again a parent involved with a national organization she had lost her son as i mentioned and was there testifying against decriminalization against legalization we also heard from the police chief of plano texas also who spoke against legalization we found also that we had some interesting testimony from our lead witness who was tom constantine and as i mentioned he is the former head of the drug enforcement agency mr constantine used several examples in his testimony to show how drugs drive demand a few years back the colombian drug cartels decided to enter the heroin market now 75 percent of the heroin sold in the united states is of colombian origin i want to talk a little bit about some of these narcotics and what mr constantine brought up and what we heard today if i can i would like to take this down and have the chart on the drug signature program all these illegal narcotics come from some place and in fact we know today through scientific studies and through programs such as the heroin signature program exactly where illegal narcotics originate this is not a guessing game this is today a science just like dna they can trace dna to individuals they can trace illegal narcotics back to their source mr constantine again former dea director talked a little bit today about the heroin problem that we have this 1997 study that he also presented to our subcommittee in a previous hearing shows exactly where heroin one of the most deadly drugs is coming from and we know that 75 percent of the heroin is coming today from south america e know that 14 percent is coming from mexico and then we have about 5 and 6 percent from southwest and southeast asia so we know very specifically that 89 percent of the heroin is coming from either colombia or mexico some 6 years ago this chart would be quite different most of the illegal narcotics were coming in from in this case heroin was coming in from southeast asia and from other sources in fact 6 years ago there was almost no heroin produced in colombia how did we get to 75 percent as mr constantine testified and this chart documents it is a simple thing it is the policy of this administration let me review for a moment if i may what took place and how we got into this situation i have heard repeatedly and i hear itover and over again the war on drugs is a failure i have heard it in the media and i have heard it recast that the war on drugs is a failure they would have the public and the congress believe that the war on drugs is a failure in fact since 1993 there has not been a war on drugs in 1993 the clinton administration basically closed down the war on drugs what they did was they began very systematically the first thing they cut was almost 90 percent of the drug czars office and operations so the drug czars office was cut first demoted really they brought in a drug czar who really ignored the problem ignored promotion of any antinarcotics programs either before the congress or with this administration what else did this administration do the first thing they did was hire so many recent drug abusers in the white house that the secret service insisted on a program to do drug testing of white house employees and i sat on the committee on government operations and heard testimony to that effect but again first they closed down the drug czars office very nearly then h5444 cc began hiring people who had very recent illegal narcotics use forcing the secret service to force the white house to institute a drug testing program next thing they did was hire probably the worst surgeon general the highest health officer that this nation had ever had and that was joycelyn elders she sent a message to our young people that said just say maybe and the statistics i cited tonight about heroin about marijuana about cocaine and about the increase in incidence among our young people i think can be traced from the beginning point of that policy of that closedown of that shutdown that ending of the war on drugs with a chief health officer of the united states of america saying to our young people just say maybe then if i can get the smallest charts here again this is repeated over and over that the war on drugs is a failure let me have these charts here these charts do not lie they tell the truth and i do not know if my colleagues can see them but this shows drug spending on international programs now international would be stopping drugs at their source probably the most effective utilization of taxpayer dollars we know that in 1993 and prior to that time that nearly 100 percent of the cocaine was coming from peru and from bolivia a little tiny bit from colombia we knew where cocaine was coming from then and coca could only be grown at certain altitudes in a certain terrain there are not many places it cannot be grown in florida or north carolina to my knowledge it can be grown only in that area in 1993 the next thing the clinton administration did and we have to re member they controlled the white house they controlled the other body the united states senate and they controlled a big majority of the house of representatives the first thing they did was cut these international programs the source country programs the slashes here are incredible again back under president bush we had 660 and this is millions of dollars we are not talking billions but they slashed them to less than half by 19951996 this is where the republicans took over the congress in the last 2 3 years we have really begun to restart the war on drugs i sat on the committee on government operations during that period when mr brown was the drug czar the drug czar in name even though i had requests from 130plus members of the house of representatives on both sides of the aisle only one hearing was held during the democrat domination of the congress and the white house only one hearing as i was a member of that committee and that was for less than an hour it was almost farcical so the war on drugs was closed down and specifically the most costeffective part of the war on drugs was closed down the other chart that i had here showed colombia now producing 75 per cent of the heroin colombia was not in the world tom constantine testified even on the charts as producing heroin today it is somewhere up in the 60 perin 1992 1993 this administration cent stopped funding cut this in less than 0 2100 half the international program so there was not funding to stop drugs at fortunately this new majority their source under the leadership of first mr zeliff if we look at 1998 and 1999 and take who began restarting the war on drugs that in 19911992 dollars we are not a former member and the former even up to the levels of the end of the chairman of the subcommittee on nabush administration and again this is tional security international affairs so cost effective because we know and criminal justice was the genwhere the heroin is produced we have tleman from illinois speaker the signature programs that show us hastert who is now speaker of the exactly where the heroin is produced house was chair and was responsible now in addition to cutting these pro for restarting the war on drugs so that grams what this administration did 15 why we see those figures going up through a very direct policy was to here stop money going to colombia the re but even the funds that were put in sults in colombia are incredible i read last year and i checked this because a washington post piece which the re again a recent story in the washporter really did not research well but ington post and repeated across the if we go back and look at what this ad land is that so much of our foreign asministration did with the cuts here sistance is going to colombia well they totally cut off colombia as far as that is bull and that is nutso that is receiving any resources helicopters not the truth assistance because they were afraid this past year we appropriated that some of that money might be used somewhere in the neighborhood of 280 to fight the marxist guerrillas who million for colombia my colleagues were in the jungles there have got to remember up to this date so what this administrations direct almost no money went to colombia in policy was and it was in direct conflict fighting illegal narcotics in fact this with the requests for the last 4 years administration kept the resources the since we have taken over the house of helicopters the ammunition from this representatives with a new majority country we begged we pleaded we sent letters so i checked to see where the money get aid get assistance get resources to is that we appropriated last year and colombia that the press is talking about saying what has happened colombia now the war on drugs is a failure and that produces 75 percent of the heroin com the third biggest foreign aid recipient ing into the united states since we after israel and egypt is colombia closed down that program effectively well that is true for this fiscal year seventyfive percent of the heroin that that money is appropriated but coming in no heroin produced in 1992 so far according to our staff investiga1993 not even on the charts addition tion somewhere between 2 million ally we could talk about mexico and 3 million has gotten to colombia which is up to 14 percent we get 89 so we have not had a wax on drugs percent of the heroin from the two of this other side of the aisle has killed them and that is part of another failed the war on drugs they completely clinton policy in certifying mexico as decimated the war on drugs cooperating this just international programs but think about colombia and what and again the dollars that were this policy has done not only do we slashed they were kept from colombia have the heroin which was not there in if my colleagues think that it is bad 19921993 coming in in unbelievable enough we have cocaine and heroin quantities at a quality that is as dead coming in in these incredible quanly as can be that is what is killing the tities through a direct failed policy of kids in plano that is what is killing this administration and the other side the kids in orlando florida that is of the aisle what they did stop and what is destroying the lives again by think about what is happening in cothe thousands deadly highpurity her lombia oin coming in through this policy everybody gets upset about kosovo but what is interesting is in 1992 over a million people have been dis1993 colombia produced almost no co placed in colombia by the civil war caine it did process coca and it was a by the marxist guerillas who are fundbig producer the coca which was par ed almost totally by illegal narcotics tially processed was brought into co profits and illegal narcotics traflombia and processed there and shipped ficking thirtyfive thousand people out either directly to the united states have died in colombia thousands of or with their buddies and network judges thousands and thousands of pothrough mexico licemen elected officials have been what has happened since that time murdered and slaughtered in colombia 1992 1993 the last administration is it has disseminated a great nation the that in fact colombia again is deprived reason was we did not want any arms of any assistance we cut this program to get there on source country in half plus we com now an area the size of switzerland pletely decimated colombia colombia is in control and the new president is now the biggest producer of cocaine and i have to admire him is trying to bring peace about trying to negotiate with the guerillas some oppose that some of are in favor of it but one cannot have a resolution to the problems with illegal narcotics which are funding the marxist activities or a resolution of illegal narcotics transiting or being produced there coming into the united states until we have peace plans so i have been supportive i have met with president pastrana he has begged for our assistance he has begged for our patience he has begged for our understanding he is trying to do anything he brought down the head of the new york stock exchange to talk to the guerillas to try to tell them that a free enterprise system is better than dogging it in the jungle and conducting war and slaughter of the colombian people i say give peace a chance i also say give a chance to restarting the war on drugs these are the facts what the newspapers have printed is bologna it is not the truth about these international programs we have been able through speaker hastert again who chaired the subcommittee on national security international affairs and criminal justice who had responsibility before my new subcommittee of criminal justice drug policy and human relations inherited it but the speaker was successful i went down with him we met with president fujimori of peru we met with president hugo banzer of bolivia those two presidents have cut drug production of cocaine with a little bit of help from their friend we are only talking 20 million 30 million out of billions and billions that we are spending on law enforcement incarceration and treatment those two presidents have acted with a little bit of help and the few aollars in the international programs which we have restarted and cut 50 percent of the cocaine production that is why we see cocaine down and more difficult to get the latest figures i have is president fujimori in peru through his hard line through his assistance through the small amount of dollars we have gotten there has reduced 60 percent both of them have plans to eliminate that so a little bit of help in these international programs can be so cost effective do not tell me any different i have been there i have seen it these are the facts again we hear the comments that interdiction and the war on drugs does not work and that we are spending too much money on interdiction look at what the clinton administration did again during the last years of the bush administration we were in the 2 billion on interdiction in that range the war on drugs was killed as far as interdicting drugs the second most cost effective way to get drugs is to stop them as they are coming in once they get passed the borders forget it folks it is harder and harder ask any policeman ask anyone who has dealt with law enforcement it is tough but here is what they did they killed the war on drugs the clinton administration which does not like the military to begin with took the military out of the war on drugs look from 1991 to 1992 2 billion level down to about 1 billion cut in half this just shows the military i have not brought up the coast guard which protects puerto rico which protects our coast line they slashed the budgets there so that is why we have colombia as the major producer of heroin we know where it is coming from the major producer of cocaine this is why we have a stream a supply that is simple economics it is economics 101 my friends that in fact as one has a tremendous supply the price goes down and it is available it is available to who at a low price our young people that is why the statistics i quoted here tonight and the theme that i had here tonight that drugs destroy lives is so true this is the policy the war on drugs died in january of 1993 with this president with this administration my colleagues can see that in 1998 1999 we are barely getting back to the level we were with the bush administration so we have not even been able to restart the war on drugs the next myth is that we have not spent enough money on treatment i believe in treatment i think anyone who has a problem we should get treatment to them we should spend whatever if we could spend 3 billion in kosovo in a few months we can certainly spend money on those who are addicted to illegal narcotics in the united states of america but here is the next point that i want to make if we look back in 1991 1992 we were spending 1 8 billion 2 2 billion on treatment 1999 it is not quite double but in fact they have been putting their eggs in the treatment basket and some of it has helped but this also should destroy a myth that we have not increased money for treatment what is interesting is since the republicans took over the congress we can see some pretty dramatic increases in money for treatment so again the myth that all the money is going into planes and to source country programs and interdiction equipment is just that it is a myth it is not the truth so that is a little bit of an update on how we got into this situation where we are on the war on drugs it is nice to come up here and talk about this but i must say that rather than just talk about it we have tried to act we have tried to act by putting our dollars into these programs we have tried to look at those that are most cost effective treatment again we have no problem with treatment education basically was not on the charts if we look back here at the beginning of this administration almost no money for education under speaker gingrich and under the leadership of the gentleman from illinois who is now the speaker we put in 195 million into an education program it is relatively new it has not completed its first year but that money is matched by donations and by equal contributions so we should have almost a half billion dollars in resources towards an education program it takes education it takes treatment it takes as i said most effectively source country programs to eradicate drugs where they are grown and where they come from then it takes interdiction and also takes enforcement so it takes all of these activities that is why if we go back and look at the bush administration and back to the reagan administration when we had the beginning of the crack and the cocaine problem in the early 1980s we saw an actual decrease in the number of individuals involved with illegal narcotics or we saw some of the activity coming down where we saw the seizures going up and again some dramatic changes the most dramatic change that we have experienced though is the end of the war in drugs in january of 1993 it is so difficult to start that back up again in addition to providing an update on the war on drugs and where we are in the war on drugs i also wanted to talk tonight as i conclude a little bit about some of the things that our subcommittee has been doing our subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources several weeks ago we conducted a hearing at the request of the gentleman from florida as my colleagues may know i have been highly critical and our subcommittee has held extensive hearings on the question of assistance in mexico because if we look at colombia and we have seen the results of what happens in our failed policy with colombia we see where illegal narcotics the tough stuff like heroin cocaine are coming from if we looked at the rest of the picture to see where the rest of the drugs are coming from probably the balance of the drugs and 60 to 70 percent of all the hard narcotics and marijuana and everything coming into the united states comes in through mexico mexico has not cooperated this congress asked over a year ago 2 years ago now for mexico to extradite individuals mexican nationals drug lords those who have been indicted in the united states and for whom we are seeking extradition they have not complied i will talk a little bit more about that in just a second in addition we asked mexico to sign a maritime agreement to date they still have not signed a maritime agreement to cooperate in going after people who are transiting and dealing in drugs in the high seas in addition we asked mexico to arm our dea agents they still have not allowed our dea agents to protect themselves my colleagues may say why why because enrique camarena one of our agents was tortured an incredibly horrible death we have a cap actually imposed by mexico on the number of agents we have a very small number it is almost incredible for the size of the problem but even so those who are there are still put at risk and mexico still refused to help us radar in the south and i am getting some word that mexico is beginning to cooperate in gettingradar to the south so before the drugs come into mexico and we know they are coming from colombia and panama and other locations that we could stop those illegal narcotics but that is still not in place and then enforcing the laws that are passed now we have gotten mexico to pass some laws and the laws are on the books but there is not the enforcement they have a corrupt judicial system they have a corrupt law enforcement system from the guy on the beat or the gal on the beat all the way to the presidents office and that has been documented with the former president salinas and his family with those in incredible positions of power with incredible amounts of money that they have skimmed off of the drug trade including one mexican general who tried to place 1 1 billion that he had gotten we know he had gotten it through illegal narcotics proceeds and he tried to place it in legitimate financial institutions but we have not had cooperation i started with extradition and let me say that several weeks ago as i began to mention our subcommittee at the request of the gentleman from florida conducted a hearing on one of the 275 extradition requests that we have this was a case relating to the murder of mrs bellush a young mother of about five or six young children in florida in sarasota who was murdered several years ago she was shot and then stabbed to death and left to die with her young baby children left in the pool of her blood until the family members came home and found her we held a hearing to protest and to look into and investigate why mexico had refused to extradite mr del toro mr del toro was not a hispanic citizen he was a citizen of the united states born in the united states to parents who are united states citizens and he helped commit this incredibly horrible crime and then fled to mexico and has for the past several years used the mexican judicial system to avoid coming back and facing justice in the united states thank goodness last night the attorney general called me and said that the mexican supreme court had ruled in favor of extradition and mr del toro is on his way back to face justice it is small compensation small condolence to the bellush family but it is one extradition unfortunately there are 274 other extradition requests on some 40 major drug dealers mexican nationals who have been involved in illegal narcotics now i believe we have had one mexican national who has been extradited but i have brought to the floor again some of the mugshots of these individuals agustin vasquezmendoza he is wanted on conspiracy to commit armed robbery and highly involved in illegal narcotics trafficking and kidnappingand aggravated assault he is a fugitive has not been arrested and one of the individuals who we are trying to get back to the united states again i bring ui the amezcua brothers who we also would like extradited to face justice in the united states so we have succeeded in one small case we have some 200plus requests for extradition of these individuals i do not believe that mexico who has always been a close ally and we have millions of mexicanamericans in the united states i do not believe these friends that we have had or mexicanamericans agree with mexicos current stance to thumb their nose at the united states and refuse to extradite these individuals who have been involved in murder illegal narcotics and trafficking so we will continue to put pressure on mexico which is now a major producer of heroin but also the source of 60 to 70 percent of the illegal narcotics transiting into the united states we will do everything possible we did introduce just before we went into recess a resolution which we hope to bring up on the floor which does praise mexico for some of the small steps that they have taken but also holds mexicos feet to the fire to produce on extradition to produce on a maritime agreement to produce on assisting our dea agents to produce on enforcing the laws that they have passed rather than thumbing their nose at the united states so until we start working with the programs that do work that are cost effective and at the source in cooperation with these countries and as a cooperative partner getting them the resources through these programs we will not be successful with that i am pleased to sum up tonight with the message that i started out with and that is that drugs destroy lives over 14 000 americans lost their lives last year almost 100 000 since the beginning of the end of the drug war which was january 1993 and again the statistics show and the facts show and prove that the war on drugs ended with the beginning of this administration and it is so difficult to start it up and that there has been so much damage to our nation to our young people and so many families across this land since i have some time left i would like to provide a little update as to what is going on as far as narcotics around the world if my colleagues think the united states is tough the headlines in one of the recent newspapers is three beheaded in saudi arabia for drug trafficking this is a report of friday may 8 three convicted drug traffickers were beheaded in saudi arabia on friday saudi arabias islamic courts imposed death sentences for murder rape and drug trafficking so far this year 21 people have been executed 29 put to death china executes 58 to mark world antinarcotics day in china they have a different approach to illegal narcotics china marked world antinarcotics day by executing 58 drug traffickers so just a little update on the news in china and how they treat drug traffickers then this report from todays financial times caribbean dourt will speed hangings and this deals with drug trafficking which has prompted crimes let me read from this many islands have witnessed rapid increases in murders and other violent crime over the past decade murders in jamaica last year averaged 2 6 a day twice the level of 0 years ago murders have doubled in trinidad and tobago over the past 5 years with many of those linked to narcotics smuggling say officials so they have a treatment and the treatment really cuts down on recidivism and that is hanging which is being demanded by these nations that have also felt this scourge of illegal narcotics i like to provide members of congress and the american people with little updates on what is going on in the war on drugs and how others from time to time approach this serious problem not that i recommend any of these procedures or remedies that i have reported here tonight i thank my colleagues for their indulgence and i will return again next week"], [0.9985087513923645, 0.9985087513923645, 0, "i am pleased to come to the floor again tonight to talk about a subject that i feel i have a particularly important responsibility on and that is the question of the problem of illegal drugs and its impact upon our society i try in these weekly talks to my colleagues in the congress to stress some of the problems that illegal narcotics have created for this congress and for our american society and for millions and millions of american families who have been ravaged by illegal drugs with their loved ones so tonight i am going to talk about again the impact of illegal narcotics on our society and families i want to talk a little bit about the history of the drug war i always think that is important no matter how many times i have told the story of how we got into this situation with a record number of deaths and abuse drug abuse among our teenagers and hard drug overdoses among our young people at record levels it is amazing how many people really are not listening to the problem that we have in this nation additionally i would like to talk a little bit about a hearing that we plan to conduct tomorrow and hearings in the future i have the privilege and honor of serving as the chair of the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources tomorrow our subcommittee will launch on a series of hearings dealing with drug legalization decriminalization and also looking at alternatives for harm reduction which seem to be sort of the popular rage we are going to attempt through those hearings series of hearings to bring more public light on those issues that are getting so much attention right now then i plan to talk a little bit about some studies one in particular in new york that debunks some of the myths about people who are incarcerated or part of our criminal justice system because of drug offenses an interesting new york study i thought i would share with the house of representatives tonight and talk a little bit more about some of the problems we have had with extraditing individuals from mexico and talk about the source of most of the hard drugs coming in to the united states which is through mexico mexico does not produce all of these drugs but certainly is the transit point and i would like to bring the house and other interested individuals up to date on what is taking place in mexico again with the problems we have incurred in getting their cooperation and our effort to combat trafficking and production of illegal narcotics finally i would like to talk a little bit about what we are doing in a positive vein to deal with this very serious problem that has affected my community and as i said millions of american families and what this new majority is doing since we have inherited the responsibility to govern to legislate and to create a new drug policy in a void really where we had no policy so those are some of the objectives tonight again i want to go over the situation because unless we have some tragedy an airplane crash a columbine some explosion some tremendous loss of life in one instantaneous cnncovered event it seems that the american people and the congress do not pay much attention what we have here is the slow death of thousands and thousands every month more and more americans dying due to drugrelated causes right now the hard statistics are last year over 14 000 americans lost their lives as a direct result of drugrelated causes most of those are overdoses really what i find very interesting in just the last 8 months of assuming this responsibility one would think we would have hard figures on all the people that die as a result of illegal narcotics and we really do not we are finding that many of the suicides some of the murders many of the other deaths that we read about traffic accidents are not counted in the statistics i am told that we could easily approach 20 000plus per year that are dying truly as a result of drugrelated deaths in this country since the beginning of this administration we have had over 100 000 deaths so put that in perspective and now the problem of drugrelated deaths has affected millions and millions of american families i would venture to say if we talked to school children if we talked to families across the country almost every one of them can tell a story of someone they know if not a relative a friend who has had a young person in particular young people are afflicted by this problem die of a drugrelated cause so it is a silent but deadly devastating rage and epidemic across our nation not only in the sheer numbers of people that have been lost but the impact on so much of our american society on the medical system on our judicial system health care on societys responsibility to help families that have lost a wage earner who is afflicted by drug dependency who is incarcerated in our legal system so again this has had a very damaging effect and it has many consequences let me read a few statistics if i may and cite them about the problems that are occurring for example in 1995 almost 532 000 drugrelated emergencies occurred nationwide in 1995 the retail value of the illicit drug business totalled 49 billion it is estimated that the problem of illegal drugs now approaches a quarter of a trillion dollars every year that is taking into account all the direct costs the indirect costs incarceration the judicial system hospitalization social costs disruption in our society lost productivity there are incredible costs and an incredible price tag to us as a nation additionally in congress and i only have a tiny bit of responsibility in the house of representatives and that is to oversee some of our drug budget which is proposed by the administration that totals about 17 9 billion in direct dollars that we can identify another part of this expensive price tag that we face according to the 1997 national household survey on drug abuse 77 million americans that is 35 6 percent of all americans age 12 and older reported some use of an illicit drug at least once during their lifetime 11 2 percent reported use during the past year and 6 4 percent reported use in the last month before the survey was conducted this is our most recent survey that shows again the impact of illegal narcotics on our society and again almost 36 percent of all americans over age 12 have been involved with illegal narcotics according to the 1998 monitoring of the future study and this is a study conducted every year 54 percent of high school seniors reported use of an illegal drug at least once in their lives so we passed the halfway mark we see again the statistics in deaths we see the statistics in addiction we see the problems that we have with our young people and we have just under 55 54 percent of all of our high school seniors reported use of an illegal drug at least once in their lives what is interesting is we conducted at least half a dozen hearings on the various subjects about drug abuse in the past few months and one hearing that we held additionally in an area of responsibility was one hearing that addressed the problem of violence in our schools and that certainly has been a topic of conversation in the congress and throughout the country since the columbine incident it is interesting to note and we had principals we had psychologists we had law enforcement people but almost every one of them who testified in our subcommittee hearing said that one of the major problems that we have and at the root of violence in our schools is drug abuse and substance abuse this was repeated over and over it is interesting when we talk about control of weapons and explosives that we do not address the question of control of substances that really lead to some of the problems that we have seen and that is violence in our schools it is sad that again we address sort of the periphery in congress we do not go to the root of the problems in these hearings we heard time after time from expert after expert that illegal narcotics are at the root of violence in our schools and in the communities so this is again the startling statistic that we have passed the halfway mark with our high school seniors at least close to 55 percent have used illegal narcotics fortyone percent reported the use in this study of an illegal drug within the past year that is 41 percent of our high school seniors now have reported the use of an illegal drug within the past school year nearly 26 percent reported the use of an illegal drug within the past month and this is the latest study and report that we have showing again some startling statistics about the use of illegal narcotics among our young people today i had an opportunity to meet with several different representatives of different organizations involved in combatting illegal narcotics one of the individuals that i had the pleasure of discussing this subject with was mr ron brooks mr brooks is the president of the national narcotics officers association and he is really on the frontline with many of the other narcotics officers across this country who from day to day sometimes risk their lives and deal on the street and in our communities with the problem of illegal narcotics what is incredible is mr brooks again president of the national narcotics officers association said that methamphetamines are becoming a national epidemic in this country we have discussed the situation that we find ourselves in with methamphetamines commonly called meth we have conducted also our subcommittee hearings in several locations in florida and atlanta and washington and we heard reports from united states attorneys from police chiefs from border patrol officers from law enforcement officials across this nation in surprising locales we had a law enforcement officer from the heart of the country in iowa testify we had information from minnesota where one would not think that there would be much of a methamphetamine problem georgia texas and the list goes on and on mr brooks and we had representatives from california talking today about the meth epidemic in that state so we have another in addition to heroin epidemic which we have experienced in florida we have in many parts of our land a methamphetamine epidemic that really needs attention let me describe a little bit about meth and what it is and the problem that we face methamphetamine is a highly addictive drug that can be manufactured by using products commercially available anywhere in the united states methamphetamine is by far the most prevalent synthetic controlled substance which is clandestinely manufactured in the united states today in 1997 it was estimated that 5 3 million americans that is 21 2 percent of our population had already tried methamphetamines in their lifetime up significantly from a 1994 estimate of 1 8 million americans the meth problem as i said is epidemic not only can it be manufactured by commercially available products that are available in the united states we found an interesting side note here and that is that most of the methamphetamine and some of the chemicals that are used in its processing come from mexico it was startling to find officials from minnesota from iowa from texas and other states who actually traced the methamphetamines back to mexico an incredible trail an incredible tale of this deadly substance coming across our borders and again far flung into communities we would never expect that now are experiencing epidemics of methamphetamine use and abuse all of this of course has a toll on the congress and the american taxpayer i cited some of the toll in dollars and cents and lost lives one of the big problems that we have is that we have people incarcerated in our prisons in our local jails across this nation it is also interesting to note when we conduct these hearings and we have sheriffs like we had our local sheriffs testify and i am very privileged in central florida to have several outstanding sheriffs sheriff bob fogel of volusia county who has had an incredible reputation of going after drug dealers taking a lot of heat for his aggressiveness in going after them but done a tremendous job in directing resources of our community in volusia county in central florida to go after those dealing in illegal narcotics sheriff don eslinger of seminole county these counties are between orlando and daytona beach that i represent don eslinger has just done a magnificent job not only as sheriff and chief law enforcement of our major county in my district but also in heading up a highintensity drug traffic area getting that off the ground which we designated 2 years ago that is interesting because under federal law we can designate a community as a highintensity drug traffic area and bring in federal resources and that has been done repeatedly sometimes i would like to make the whole united states a highintensity drug traffic area that would be a great goal it would be a great objective if we could do that but right now we are limited because we have limited resources to pick those areas that have been disproportionately impacted and that can justify additional federal resources designating them as a highintensity drug traffic area then providing resources to the local community to deal with that problem that is what we have done in central florida legislatively i was able to achieve that with the help of senator graham with the help of other colleagues in central florida we did get central florida the corridor from daytona beach over to the tampa west coast designated as a highintensity drug traffic area with 1 million in initial contributions from the federal government to go to beef up these activities this past year we added 2 5 million what is really fabulous is we have seen results the headlines of the papers just in the last week trumpeted some of the success that we have had don eslinger helped lead that effort our sheriff and the individual who helped us start our highintensity drug traffic area so don eslinger also testified before our hearings he told our subcommittee in hearings in central florida that we conducted in fact right out of the box when i took over this responsibility of chair of the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources in those hearings don testified that in fact 70 to 80 percent of those incarcerated and that he has arrested are there because of drugrelated offenses an incredible statistic we find that if we look at our federal prisons and other penitentiaries and jails across the country in similar testimony we see that 60 to 70 percent of those that are behind bars in this country are there because again drug offenses now we are approaching 2 million we have 1 8 million incarcerated in jails just imagine what this country would be like if we could eliminate 60 to 70 percent of the crime 60 to 70 percent of those incarcerated how we could use those resources imagine the tremendous waste of human beings life to have them sitting behind bars because they have committed a felony and drug offense the statistics again are just startling about use by those in prison a recent survey that we had submitted to us our subcommittee said that overall 82 percent of all jailed inmates in 1996 had used an illegal drugup 78 percent from 1989 we had again a huge increase in those in prison who were there because of a drugrelated crime we also find that a large large percentage 82 percent of all jail and inmates had used illegal narcotics eightyone percent of individuals selling drugs test positive at the time of arrest including 56 percent for cocaine and 13 percent for heroin this is interesting because we have people who are selling and involved in trafficking of narcotics are also drug users and involved in the hard drugs of heroin and cocaine a study by the parent resource and information on drug r6port which is called pride reported recently of high school students who reported having carried guns to school 31 percent use cocaine compared to 2 percent of the students who had never carried guns to school the same relationship was found among junior high school students nineteen percent of gang members reported cocaine use compared to 2 percent among use who were not in gangs so it is interesting that not only our prisons those involved in felonies involved with illegal narcotics that even those young people who cause the disruption in our schools by bringing weapons into schools are involved with the hard narcotics and at the statistic level that we cited in this report these are again some of the problems we face with incarceration i wanted to talk for a minute since tomorrows topic of discussion before our subcommittee will be the question of pros and cons of drug legalization decriminalization and harm reduction tomorrow again is just the first in a series of hearings that we will be holding to address these issues we will hear administration policy and pleas that we are going to lead off with our drug czar barry mccaffrey who has helped the new majority in congress restart the war on drugs i know he does not like that term and i could see why because this administration before he assumed the responsibility of the chief executive officer and director of our office of national drug control policy before he came on board we basically had a vacuum we had a closing down of the war on drugs general mccaffrey has helped restart that we will also hear in addition to the chief national drug enforcement officer that controls our national policy our drug czar dr alan leshner director of the national institute on drug abuse and hear what the national institute on drug abuse feels about legalization decriminalization and how we should approach harm reduction then we will hear from the deputy administrator of our drug enforcement administration mr donnie marshall it is sad as i said that we recently learned of the retirement this summer pending retirement of tom constantine i cannot sing enough praises of mr constantine he has been the administrator of the drug enforcement administration he has sometimes taken up positions that are difficult with an administration that has not always been willing to cooperate but he has done so with great integrity with great honesty gained the trust of almost every member of congress and certainly their respect tomorrow we will hear from donnie marshall his deputy and see how the administration feels about these proposals again to liberalize and legalize and decriminalize some of our drug laws i am pleased also that we will have jim mcdonough jim mcdonough was a deputy in the national drug czars office and has moved on to direct floridas effort under the able leadership of our new governor jeb bush who right from the beginning found one of the best individuals in the country to come to florida and help us with the mounting problem that we have had there jim mcdonough is no stranger to the office of drug control policy as i said he was a deputy there admirably served and now is serving us in florida and we will hear his opinion from the state level i am pleased to welcome him at our hearing then we will also hear from mr scott elders a senior policy analyst with the drug foundation and then we are going to hear from robert l maginnis who is the senior director of the family research council and mr david boaz executive vice president of the cato institute and mr ira glasser executive director of the american civil liberties union this is only our first hearing on this subject we intend to look at the medical use of marijuana we intend to look at some of the programs across the country that have dealt with decriminalization some of the efforts in arizona and others that have been touted recently as sort of a prelude to that hearing i tried to assemble some of the most recent reports relating to decriminalization one of the interesting things in my position is many people come to me asking why we do not look at not incarcerating people for drug use they think drug use is something personal if someone wants to get stoned or someone wants to walk around in a cloud it does not do any harm these people are sitting in our prisons this is a waste of taxpayer money and most of the people in prison they would have us believe they are firsttime users or have not committed a serious offense only personal use and possession of illegal narcotics one of the most recent studies which i obtained a copy of is narrow pathways to prison and it is entitled the selective incarceration of repeat drug offenders in the state of new york this is the most recent report that i found rather thorough it was produced by catherine lapp the director of criminal justice in april just released in the last month or two and i thought i would try to debunk a few of the myths about some of the things that have been said that again these are firsttime offenders that these are people who only had personal use of some illegal substance and have done no harm let me just read from this report and again a pretty factual and well documented report about what they found advocates seeking to reduce or eliminate incarceration of drug offenders often focus their concerns on the following two types of offenders first incarcerated drug offenders with no prior felony arrest histories and second incarcerated drug offenders whose only prior felony arrest and perhaps convictions involved drug offenses this report helps to eliminate the circumstances underlying the incarceration of those two groups of offenders it reveals that the vast majority of these offenders never receive prison sentences and most of those who are sentenced to prison have failed to abide by conditions of community supervision an interesting finding now there are two parts to this report and i will just read the summaries and then the conclusion part one and it is entitled drug offenders with no prior felony arrests or conviction few felony drug arrestees without prior felony histories receive prison sentences in new york state as shown ip one of their charts fewer than 10 percent of disposed felony drug arrestees without a prior felony arrest or conviction are sentenced to prison the other 90 percent are diverted from the criminal justice system prior to conviction or sanctioned locally these data suggest that the criminal justice system is very selective in its use of prison for firsttime offenders so this is new york it is one very comprehensive study just completed a few months ago and its conclusion is that these firsttime offenders are not going into prison there is a second part to this study which is quite interesting and the title of the second part is drug offenders whose only prior felony history arrest or conviction involves drug offenses now we are going to look at those who have had a history of felony arrests which involved drug offenses and this is the second part and second conclusion most suspects who are arrested for felonylevel drug crimes and whose prior felony histories are limited to drug crimes do not receive prison sentences in new york state as shown in one of the charts they provide approximately 70 percent of the disposed felony arrests are either diverted from the criminal justice system prior to conviction or sanctioned locally again the data indicates a very selective use of prison even when the arrestee has a prior drug felony arrest history so these folks that are sitting in our prisons are not onetime users they are not firsttime users and the conclusion of this report is quite interesting again i thought i would provide verbatim the conclusion that was reached in this new york study this report provides an accurate and objective insight into the manner in which new york states criminal justice system adjudicates persons charged with drug offenses contrary to images portrayed by rockefeller drug law reform advocates the drug offenders serving time in our state prison system today are committed to prison because of their repeated criminal behavior leaving judges with few options short of prison in the past decade numerous alternatives to prison and prison diversion programs have been implemented to target nonviolent drug abusing offenders in an effort to reduce unnecessary reliance on prison and reduce recidivism among this category of offenders the programs range from merit time to shock incarceration detab and the willard drug treatment program our subcommittee intends to look at some of these diversion programs in future hearings and future investigations these programs and others have yielded promising results however as this report clearly demonstrates when offenders continue to flaunt the system and fail to abide by the conditions of their release the court must take swift action and impose appropriate sentences of imprisonment in order to protect society and break the cycle of crime this is a very interesting report and i will make that a part of the record of our hearing tomorrow as we discuss in one of the rare times that i can recall that congress has addressed the question of drug legalization decriminalization a very interesting factual report and it blows away some of the myths about who is in prison who is behind bars and what brought them to prison tonight again in addition to talking about the hearings that we have held and the hearings we are going to hold tomorrow i want to repeat a little bit of the history of how we got ourselves into this situation i do not mean to beat a dead horse but again it is amazing how many people do not know the story of really this administration and this presidents direct efforts to close down the war on drugs in 1993 when they gained control from 1993 of the house of representatives of the other body the united states senate and of the white house the first thing they did was dismantle the drug czars office most of the people that were cut from th white house staff were cut from the staff of the drug czars office which has been part of the executive office of the president what was sad and i sat on the thencommittee on government reform and oversight and had been on the committee on government operations prior to that is this administration completely ignored national drug policy for 2 years for 2 years when i came as a freshman in 1993 i repeatedly made requests of the chairman of the committee on government operations that was responsible for drug policy oversight for hearings repeatedly we requested that there be some oversight of what was happening as they dismantled the war on drugs as they took the military out of the war on drugs as they cut the coast guard budget in half in the war on drugs as they began a systematic dismantling of the source country program which was stopping illegal narcotics most costeffectively in the few nations and areas where those illegal narcotics are produced i called for and others signed letters in fact at one point i believe we had over 130 members republican and democrat who asked for hearings and policy review of what was going on with the destruction dismantling and ending of the war on drugs by this administration during that entire time there was one hearing which was approximately 1 hour where they had the drug czar lee brown lee brown and i say this with protection of immunity on the floor of the house of representatives was probably the worst public official in the history of not only this administration but for every administration of this century he did more to oversee the dismantling and destruction of a policy that had proven effective to deal with illegal narcotics than any other human being on the face of the map of the united states and he came and testified i will never forget in a hearing that lasted less than an hour i think the record would prove talking about that and that was only after nearly a disruption of the entire committee process to get one hearing in 2 years on national drug policy as this socalled drug czar oversaw that effort the results are incredible because from taking the war on drugs apart and dismantling that hiring a surgeon general who said just say maybe from sending the wrong message if i had it to do over again id inhale all of these things added up to where today we have since 1993 an 875 percent increase in heroin use by our teenagers my colleagues heard the statistics on methamphetamines the statistics on the death and destruction particularly among our young people this has had very devastating results and it was due to a very concentrated effort by a few people and a majority that took control of this congress from 1993 to what is amazing too is that we have known and i have repeated this on the floor of the house we have known the source of most of the illegal narcotics we know that cocaine was produced in only three countries and 90 percent of it until this administration took control 90 percent of all the coca in the world that came into the united states was produced in peru and bolivia now in 6 years they managed to shift that production to today to colombia and i will talk in a minute about how we got into the situation with colombia now becoming the major producer of cocaine also through a direct policy of this administration which was to stop all resources assistance aid ammunition helicopters anything they could stop getting to colombia and the colombian national police to deal with the narcotics production and trafficking problem that was a direct policy of this administration that failed to deal with that problem the good news was that the house of representatives and the other body went into the hands of the other party and let me say that i had the honor and privilege of serving under the gentleman from illinois now the speaker of the house of representatives when he took on the responsibility under the leadership of the new majority to put the war on drugs and begin to effectively reassemble what had been started by the reagan and bush administration again a real war on drugs the first thing that the gentleman from illinois did was to work with bolivian and peruvian officials to aid their effort and restart the source country programs for eradicating costeffectively drugs at their source again i cited that most of the cocaine produced in the world and coming into the united states in 1993 to 1995 was from peru and bolivia so the gentleman from illinois went to the source i went with him we went out into the fields we met with the national officials the presidents and they restarted those efforts through that effort in the last 2 3 years those two countries peru and bolivia through the leadership of hugo bonzer the president of bolivia through the leadership of mr fujimori the president of peru they have cut the production of coca in half 50 percent and they have plans in the next 2 years to try to eliminate the production the only problem is while we were making progress there and asking the administration to get assistance to colorhbia which was becoming a new source of the cultivation of coca this administration blocked all of those efforts and we saw and we have seen in the last few years colombia again through a direct policy we can relate to this administration become the number one producer of cocaine and coca the base of cocaine in the world what is absolutely startling is from 1993 to 1995 if we go back and look at colombia there was almost no production zero almost nada zip production of heroin from colombia most of it came in from southeast asia a little bit from mexico this administration again through its direct policies has made colombia the number one producer colombia is known for its beautiful flowers that are imported around the world and a natural place to start growing poppies and they did because this administration stopped the resources from getting to colombia and to the national police only in the last year or two has this new majority been able to appropriate over the wishes of this administration and also even see the delivery in the last few months of equipment ammunition resources helicopters to the republic of colombia to combat those illegal narcotics that are being grown and shipped and transhipped through colombia so we know colombia is the number one source we know what the problem has been and i think we have effectively dealt with it with again this new majority in congress initiative not with any help of the administration then the second area that we know there has been incredible volumes of hard narcotics coming into the united states of course is mexico the situation with mexico gets even worse last week in mexico we had the death of one of the stars of mexico who was brutally machinegunned downed on the streets of mexico and come to find out even the hardcore mexicans were shocked by this death i believe it was in open daylight in mexico and come to find out it is a drugrelated death and this individual was involved with illegal substances and was gunned down probably by traffickers we will know more about that the news as i said gets even worse about mexico mexico in a report that i just was briefed on this afternoon it appears and this will be in the media in the coming days it appears that both the former president salinas and his brother had some direct involvement in one of the i believe religious leaders in that country who is also a candidate he was brutally slain and there are reports now from reliable sources that because this individual had that information the former president and his brother wanted him rubbed out and that even the military was involved in this action to gun down and murder an outstanding religious and potential political figure of mexico the news as i said gets even worse this past week tim golden reported in the new york times and he does an excellent job revealing and investigating what is going on with mexico which is involved up to its eyeballs and at every level with corruption with illegal narcotics dealing tim golden revealed that the secretary to the current president zedillo mr sines has managed to avoid a thorough investigation even our officials have turned their backs on seeing that mr sines is properly investigated highest assistant to the president of mexico there are some very very serious allegations of his involvement with illegal narcotics trafficking and activity and corruption in that country that should be investigated fairly and honestly and not swept under the table by unitedstates officials or by mexican officials the news about mexico gets even worse as i reported we conducted a hearing on mexico and in fact several hearings on mexico and found evidence and testimony was given by one of our former customs officials of a general attempting to launder 1 1 billion in illegal narcotics profits through legitimate unitedstates sources so again it is a very sad situation we fail to have the cooperation of mexico in trafficking and again a majority of illegal narcotics even those produced in colombia are transited through mexico and enter the united states they enter mexico they enter florida they enter the entire united states we have provided through the trade benefits we have given to mexico free and open commercial borders and we have asked very little in return we have just asked mexico to cooperate in seizing heroin and in seizing cocaine and seizing methamphetamines and what does the report show in fact it shows that in 1998 rather than seizing more illegal hard narcotics the mexicans are seizing less opium and heroin seizures in 1998 versus 1997 were down 56 percent cocaine seizures by mexican officials over that same period were down 35 percent so rather than help us in seizing illegal narcotics instead of helping the united states who has been a good ally assisting mexico in very difficult financial times we underwrote the mexican financial institutions and their currency we opened our trade to mexican commercial activities and instead of cooperation we actually have a lesser level of cooperation and this administration has consistently certified mexico this congress some 2 years ago plus passed a resolution asking mexico to cooperate to pass a maritime agreement and enter into a maritime agreement so that we could seize drugs on the open waters to date they have not signed a maritime agreement we asked mexico to extradite major drug traffickers mexican nationals to date not one major mexican national has been extradited when we introduced just in the past few days a bill in congress myself and the gentleman from florida and others legislation that will go after the unitedstates assets and other assets of major drug kingpins we finally got the extradition of one mr martin a united states national who we had requested extradition on we have requested over 275 extradition requests of the mexicans over the past decades or less there are over 40 major drug traffickers whose extradition we have requested to date not one mexican national has been extradited what is really sad is the major producers the major traffickers in methamphetamines were the amezcua brothers and recently to kick sand in our face to really slap the united states mexican judicial officials threw out the charges on two of the amezcua brothers and they in fact still have not been extradited to the united states indicted in the united states requests for extradition and again over 40 major drug traffickers mexican nationals not one extradited to the united states also we requested radar in the south to stop the trafficking coming up through central and south america and that has not been done by the mexicans we have asked that our dea agents after we had the murder of one of our agents some years ago that they be armed to be able to protect themselves and we have a very limited number of dea agents because mexico has limited the number of agents and we still to this date have not had cooperation in allowing our agents to defend themselves so we see a situation that is very critical in the united states incredible numbers of death the effect on our young people the cost to our society the cost to this congress the cost to mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters who have lost loved ones we have seen a closedown of the war on drugs in 1993 and 1995 and a restarting by this new majority where we put the resources back in we started the source country programs the interdiction we brought the military and the coast guard back into the effort a real effort this new majority also passed a 190millionplus program unprecedented to start dealing with demand reduction educating our young people and that money is matched by private sector donations very costeffective so we have taken some steps we do not want to take a step backward tomorrow we will hear about drug legalization decriminalization and harm reduction from those leaders of the administration it is my hope again to continue this effort before the house of representatives before the congress because it is the most important social question the most important criminal justice question the most important societal question facing the american people and our congress again in great cost in lives and money and we will be back so tonight as i conclude i thank those who have listened and who are willing to take up arms and efforts in combatting illegal narcotics i thank my colleagues for their attention and i promise as general macarthur said i shall return and will continue to bring this topic before the congress and the american people"], [0.9984857439994812, 0.9984857439994812, 0, "i am pleased to come before the house although the hour is late i think the subject is extremely important and some of it will continue upon a dialogue that was begun in the last hour by the gentleman from california and the gentlewoman from wisconsin on the subject of colombia i do chair in the house of representatives the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources and have attempted this year almost on a weekly basis to come to the floor of the house and spend part of a tuesday evening when we have the extensive time granted to members to discuss issues up until the magic hour of midnight i have used that time to speak on what i consider the biggest social and criminal justice and health policy facing our nation and that is the problem of illegal narcotics and drug abuse just as a wrapup tonight discussing some of the activities of our subcommittee and i think it has had a very effective and also full schedule during 1999 we have held almost 30 hearings and almost 20 of them on the topic of drug policy i remember coming to congress in 1993 from 1993 to 1995 when the other side controlled the house of representatives the white house and the other body during that period of time only one hearing was held in an oversight capacity on the topic of our national drug policy and that is part of how we got ourselves into the situation we are in today with the dramatic increases in druginduced deaths resulting from illegal narcotics and also from the incredible numbers we have in prison and also the societal problems and costs that we see that are incurred not only by congress but to american families and parents throughout our land so we have had as i said a full list of hearings we have tried to cover a number of topics starting last january in my own district to assess the problem in central florida and the area that i serve i have repeatedly mentioned that central florida is a very prosperous area of our nation and it has been ravaged by illegal narcotics their headlines have blurted out this past year that drug deaths now exceed homicides and the situation continues to be critical in spite of some of the solutions that we have put in place and steps that we have taken it is a vary difficult problem to solve we have seen that we do know that in some jurisdictions through some efforts there have been successes and in others there have been failures in february of this year we asked one of those success stories to be heard before our subcommittee and we conducted a hearing that featured new york mayor rudy giuliani and certainly of all the examples of successes in this country no one has been more successful or more effective in curtailing illegal narcotics crime and certainly bringing the murder rate under control than rudy giuliani in fact when he became mayor of new york some years ago the average annual murders were around the 2 000 mark in fact in excess of 2 000 a 70 percent decline in the murder rate there has been achieved through a zerotolerance and tough enforcement policy that has worked hopefully the success story that we heard about there is being replicated and we know that it is being replicated in other communities and where it is we have seen also some dramatic decreases in crime violence and narcotics use also important to our subcommittee and in developing the houses strategy for dealing with the problem of illegal narcotics narcotics trafficking is looking at the areas that bring drugs forth into our country into our borders and we have spent several hearings back in february looking at the situation as far as mexico seventy percent of the illegal narcotics coming into the united states transit through mexico we conducted a rather thorough review and oversight of our policy toward mexico in advance of the presidents requirement under law to certify mexico as cooperating under again a federal law that requires that certification that mexico is cooperating with the united states to stop both the production and trafficking of illegal narcotics in return for that certification and cooperation a country under that law whether it is mexico or other countries is eligible to receive benefits of the united states either foreign assistance financial assistance financial support votes in international organizations and also they receive certain benefits as far as trade from the united states that is once they are certified as fully cooperating we did review the previous years experience with mexico and found some of their efforts lacking in fact reductions in seizures of both heroin and cocaine and not really addressing some of the requests that the congress had made some 2 years ago including extraditing major drug kingpin traffickers signing a maritime agreement which they still have not done allowing our dea agents to protect themselves in their country and that was based on the experience we had with one dea agent murdered some years ago and also enforcement of mexican drug laws that were passed and money laundering laws that were passed that were unfortunately passed but not fully executed we looked at all of the range of requests that this congress had made 2 years ago to see if mexico in fact had complied and we found in fact their cooperation lacking in fact one of the most disturbing reports that we had from that hearing was in fact that mexico according to our united states department of state continues to be the primary haven for money laundering in latin america one of the things that was most disturbing about the actions of mexico was that while we had asked them to execute and enforce the laws that they had passed dealing with money laundering we found instead hostility towards an investigation that the united states began in that country that investigation was probably the largest money laundering investigation in the history of the united states customs and certainly on the international scene and involved hundreds of millions of dollars that we know came from drug money laundering this undercover operation was the largest money laundering sting in the history of the united states as it ended up 40 mexicans and venezuelan bankers businessmen and suspected drug cartel members were arrested and 70 others indicted as fugitives the united states officials at the time of our prelimitiary work on this investigation and during the investigation did not fully inform mexican counterparts of the operation because they feared mexican corrupt officials might endanger our agents lives however they were kept abreast generally of the operation three of mexicos most prominent banks bancomer banc serfin and banc confia were implicated in this investigation this investigation also revealed some startling facts about what is going on in mexico one of our senior united states customs agents who led the casa blanca probe declared that corruption had reached the highest levels of the zedillo government the current government when he implicated the minister of defense of mexico enrique cervantes in june of 1998 the mexican government advised the united states it would prosecute united states customs agents and informers who took part in operation casa blanca so rather than cooperate with the united states mexico threatened to indict and arrest the united states officials involved in that operation in february of this year 1999 a mexican judge denied the extradition of five mexican bankers that the united states had requested for their role in operation casa blanca in fact extradition continues to be a very sore point in relations between the united states and mexico last week i reported that we met with the attorney general and the foreign minister of mexico here in washington in what was i believe the seventh high level working group that included our drug czar other high level officials in our administration the secretary under secretary for international narcotics matters and officials from various united states agencies and numerous members of both the house and the other body at the top of our request list again to mexico was a question of extradition not only in the casa blanca case but to date united states officials have 275 pending requests for extradition with mexico to date mexico has not extradited a single kingpin drug or illegal narcotics trafficker despite requests mexico has only approved 42 extradition requests since 1996 of 20 of the extradition requests that mexico has approved there has only been one of those who has been a mexican citizen no major drug kingpin from mexico who is a mexican national again has been indicted to date in june of this past year our subcommittee did hold another hearing on mexicos cooperation on the question of extradition the title of that hearing is is mexico a safe haven for murderers and drug traffickers particularly we looked into the case brought to the attention of the subcommittee and the congress of a suspected murderer mr del toro who was suspected of murder very heavily implicated in the death of a sarasota florida woman a terrible death in which this woman was murdered and the body was left with her two young children that individual even though his name is del toro was a unitedstates citizen fled to mexico and was granted temporary refuge there i am pleased that after our june 23 hearing that mexico did extradite mr del toro and he is now sitting in jail in florida awaiting justice in our system we have made some progress but again to date not one single major drug kingpin who is a mexican national has been extradited this is all in spite of the fact that on november 13 1997 the united states and mexico signed a protocol to the current extradition treaty now this protocol basically the outline and agreement for extradition has been ratified by the united states senate but is currently still being delayed by the mexican senate they have failed to act on that and as i said they also have failed to act on the signing or reaching a maritime agreement of cooperation i am pleased that this year we have some indication of increased seizures of cocaine and heroin by mexican officials in cooperation with the united states officials that is some good news some bad news is that we have just received additional information on the signature heroin program i have had before this chart that showed and i think we can see it here 14 percent of the heroin coming into the united states was coming in 1997 from mexico we know this is pretty accurate because these tests that are done by dea are almost a dna sampling and can almost trace this heroin to the fields from which the heroin originates unfortunately i just received this chart last week of the 1998 seizures of heroin in the united states this shows that mexico has jumped from 14 to 17 percent of the heroin entering the united states comes from mexico that does not sound like much 14 to 17 percent but it is about a 20 percent increase what is startling too is in the early 1990s we were in the single digits in production primarily black tar heroin from mexico the other scary thing of all the heroin that is coming into the united states is the purity levels that were in the low teens as far as the purity of heroin is now coming in from both mexico south america and other sources is a very high purity level sometimes 80 90 percent so what we have is more production from mexico more production from south america in particular colombia and more production of a very deadly heroin and that is one reason why we have the epidemic of heroin deaths both in my district and throughout the united states we do have some serious problems with mexico we will continue from our subcommittee to monitor their cooperation we have that responsibility our primary responsibility of course is stopping drugs at their source interdicting drugs before they come into the united states that really is something that we have tried to closely examine how effective that has worked in the past and i have held up some of these charts before particularly in the reagan administration and the bush administration the united states federal government as we can see by this chart up to 1993 with the clinton administration had continually addressed proper funding and spending for international programs international programs are stopping drugs at their source basically what happened is the war on drugs was closed down in 1993 when the other side took over the house the senate and the white house and clinton policy really gutted all of these programs that meant crop alternative programs stopping drugs at their source anything that dealt on the international level which again is a primary responsibility of the federal government was either slashed dramatically or these programs eliminated only now in 1995 with the advent of the new majority have we really gotten ourselves back to the reaganbush dollar levels of funding for the international programs we can see some immediate success in several areas particularly peru and bolivia where they have cut production of cocaine in peru by some 60 percent in bolivia by over 50 percent just in several years the one area where we have not had a reduction in narcotics trafficking and production of course is colombia the previous speakers the gentleman from california the gentlewoman from wisconsin talked about colombia and i think in somewhat nostalgic terms i believe at least one of the speakers had participated in our peace corps and both are familiar with colombia we have a very serious problem with colombia today that problem did not happen overnight that problem is a direct result of a policy i believe and we held a number of hearings in our subcommittee on the subject and in the congress there have been some 16 hearings on that subject that i am aware of both in our subcommittee and other committees including international relations on the problems relating to colombia colombia is another example of the united states changing policy with the clinton administration ending the war on drugs they stopped the international programs they stopped the interdiction programs and this would be stopping drugs from the source to the united states borders again we do not see a change in this policy getting us back to the level of funding that we had under the reagan and bush administration until up to the new majority taking control otherwise we see a complete slash in stopping drugs at their source and also interdicting drugs as they came from their source in fact one of the first actions of the clinton administration was to cease providing intelligence information to colombia on may 1 1994 that was the beginning of our problems with colombia and from the time of this bad policy adoption things have gone dramatically downhill in colombia that policy change created a gap that allowed drug flights and transit areas that were once denied to drug traffickers to open wide open only after the united states congress intervened and identified this misstep did the clinton administration after some very harmful delays resume intelligencesharing what is interesting the next step was removal of some of the overflight and surveillance information and i believe the vice president was involved in some of those decisions to take some of our awacs planes and other information surveillance aircraft and move them to different locations some of course went to other deployments of the clinton administration it is my understanding one awacs was sent by the vice president over alaska to check for oil spills as opposed to taking care of providing information to go after drug traffickers in addition to going after drug traffickers the other important thing has been to stem some of the violence the narcoterrorist violence in colombia it is important that we pay attention to human rights and that human rights violations do not go unpunished president pastrano the new president of colombia has made incredible progress very few human rights violations by the military have been reported the united states is also providing training to their military so that they are aware of human rights violations and that they do conduct themselves as far as their military activities in compliance with international standards and basic human rights however the human rights of 30 000 colombians were ignored in this period of time that is how many colombians have met their fate and their death as a result of narcoterrorism in their country so tens of thousands have died over 4 000 police public officials and everyone from members of their congress to their supreme court have been slaughtered murdered in what has taken place as lawlessness and this terrorist insurgency has taken hold what is even sadder is that 80 percent of all cocaine and 75 percent of all the heroin in the united states today comes from colombia if we looked at a chart back in 1992 1991 we would see very little cocaine produced in colombia this administration through its policy again of stopping information of stopping resources getting to colombia and of denying assistance to colombia to combat illegal narcotics has allowed in some 6 or 7 years for colombia to now become the largest cocaine producer in the world it also went from almost a zero production of heroin or poppies to now providing and i think the charts show some 60 percent to 70 percent of all of the heroin coming into the united states we can very definitely identify as coming from colombia all this took place under the clinton administration and in spite of repeated pleas from both the minority when we were in the minority and since we have taken over the majority to make certain that resources and assistance got to colombia what is absolutely incredible as i stand before the house tonight we still tind ourselves faced with aid that we requested some years ago with assistance that we appropriated in the previous fiscal year still not getting to colombia if i have heard one thing once i have heard it a thousand times i have heard that the country of colombia is the third largest recipient of the united states foreign aid that is based on a supplemental that was provided last year by the republican majority initiated by in fact the former chair of this subcommittee the gentleman from illinois who is now speaker of the house i worked diligently to make sure colombia had the resources and we passed under our watch a supplemental to make certain that the resources got to the source the primary source of illegal hard drugs cocaine and heroin coming into the united states it is absolutely incredible again to report that the house the findings from closeddoor sessions we held for the last 2 weeks we find that in fact it was not 300 million in total that went to colombia that got whittled away so 42 million ended up actually of 230 million 42 million went to peru and bolivia additionally we have been requested or we were requesting since 1995 that helicopters which have been requested by colombia be sent to colombia to deal with eradication and to deal also with the insurgency that was financed in cooperating with narcotics illegal natcotics in that country what is again absolutely incredible is that to date we have in colombia six of nine huey helicopters that are operating we expended 40 million on that so twothirds of what we requested as far as huey helicopters are operating so that is six total hueys at a cost of 40 million one of the other helicopters that has been requested was black hawk helicopters which have both combat capability and also high altitude capability which we need and flexibility for colombia which has mountainous ranges where coke and poppy are grown and also trafficked what is absolutely incredible is that out of the three or out of six that we funded for colombia only three have been delivered of the three that have been delivered in fact none of them are operational at this point because all three of them lack proper floor armoring and additionally they do not have ammunition now the ammunition we requested and i know i have been involved in that for several years and miniguns to go to colombia we had testimony again behind closed doors that in fact as of november 1 that ammunition and those miniguns had been shipped but we did not have confirmation as of last week whether or not they had been delivered so we have actually only six operating huey helicopters out of nine and six would be 15 requested and three of the black hawks are not operational now if we also look at the dollars involved we take out 42 million for peru and bolivia and we are down to 190 million and we find that the black hawk helicopters really accounted for a great deal of the balance of the residual funds the super hueys and several other activities what in fact we find out is that of the 232 million above there was 176 million in fact set aside for colombia but only onehalf of this has actually been delivered or is operational what is even more startling is the administration announced with great fanfare that the president was going to take surplus equipment again in the previous fiscal year in 1999 and we are now in 19992000 but this is called 506 a drawdown it is offtheshelf equipment to date not one single piece of equipment or assistance has been provided to colombia at this juncture however the administration admits now that we have an emergency situation general barry mccaffrey who is head of our antidrug effort and our national drug czar described colombia as and i will quote him as an emergency situation at a hearing before our subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources on august 6 of 1999 now i believe that the administration is somewhat embarrassed to come to the congress in these final days as we debate the 19992000 normal budget and request additional funds anyone who looks at this and details the amount of money appropriated by congress initiated in the house of representatives for colombia and then sees what has actually been delivered would be shocked and i think somewhat embarrassed to come here and start asking for a billion to 2 billion and i might say that we are not opposed to additional funds on our side of the aisle for colombia we have a situation out of control we have a region that is in danger we have a neighbor that is just a few hours away from miami we have an instability that is being created now all the way up to the panama canal over into the caribbean and through central and south america by this situation that has grown out of control general mccaffrey also went on to state the united states has paid inadequate attention to a serious and growing emergency that probably will go down in history as one of the understatements particularly given the latest information that we have and again the disruption to the whole region that we see it is interesting to note too that general serrano who is the chief of the colombian national police he stated to our subcommittee that 90 percent of the antidrug missiqns the colombian national police must conduct are required to be conducted by helicopter again given the terrain of the country i know it is nice to think that just good things will happen if we wish and hope and i respect the opinion of the other members who spoke in here before on the floor but i think we know that some tough measures are needed and that this insurgency must be brought under control by president pastrana or there never will be peace in colombia or there never will be peace in this region the latest information that we have just a few months ago is that the farc which is the guerrilla forces financed by illegal narcotics activities earn up to 600 million per year in profits from the drug trade united states officials believe that the area under drug cultivation in colombia has spiralled from some 196 000 acres last year from 79 000 acres and this again is a problem i think created by inattention by this administration by stopping the resources by decertifying colombia in the improper manner in which it was decertified without a national interest waiver to make certain that these longsoughtafter pieces of equipment and in some cases ammunition helicopters arrived there to help in bringing this pattern of devastation and leftwing guerrilla activity under control a recent united statesbased general accounting report said cocaine production in colombia has increased by 50 percent just since 1996 making it again the number one cocaine producer in the world it is interesting to note that the year before the administration began its efforts to make certain that none of the equipment and resources that the congress was trying to provide got to colombia so again the history of colombia is interesting even this past week and in fact in the newspaper we have a report of the colombian rebels making certain demands to the current government and this story is dateline bogota colombia the countrys largest guerrilla group said it would reject a yearend truce offer unless the government stopped extraditing drug suspects to the united states that is one of the major conditions they put forth and i will say that last week colombia as opposed to mexico where we have had inaction did vote for the extradition of major drug traffickers now we have the marxist guerrilla group financed by drug traffickers threatening to hold the peace process in abeyance if colombian officials go forward with the extradition of the major drug kingpin traffickers we will be back i am sure next year to the topic of colombia even though we wind up in the next few days here our budget in washington let me turn a moment to the situation in washington as most people who observe the congress know we are in the process of winding up our yearend responsibilities and that is funding all of the activities of the federal government that process takes place through the adoption of 13 bills each of which funds or federal government today we have passed about eight of those and we have about five in contention one of those in contention is the district of columbia the president has vetoed the appropriations measure for the district of columbia what is really interesting at this juncture we have passed a balanced budget the new majority brought the countrys finances into order we have a basic agreement we set up terms of that agreement so that we must stick to the budget agreement in terms we are doing pretty much that even within the district budget we have to remember the district budget when we took over control of the house of representatives after 40 years of control by the other party the district of columbia was inshambles the year we took over they were short in debt just for one year about threequarters of a billion dollars that means the taxpayers from across the country were underwriting the largesse and wild spending not only of the federal government and its agencies but also the district of columbia that situation has been brought under control by the new majority just as we brouglit into balance the federal budget we did that by eliminating some of the employees they had the largest number of employees of any governmental body probably outside the former soviet union they had 48 000 employees which meant that about one out of 10 in the district of columbia worked for the district of columbia not mentioning the contracts that were let we got that down i believe to around 33 000 the issue is not about spending this year because we have brought into control the operations of the district we brought in new management fortunately one of those individuals is now the mayor and the district just like our national budget on an annualized basis of course we have debt but on an annualized basis is in fairly good order the reason the president has vetoed the bill is not dealing with dollars and cents it is dealing with policy the clinton administration has championed a needle exchange program for the district of columbia that has been one of the bones of contention the other of course is a liberalized drug policy with regard to referendum to legalize certain drugs in the district of columbia so part of the fight on the floor of the house has been about policy and liberalization of drug policy i have shown many times this chart of baltimore where baltimore went in 1996 from 38 000 almost 39 000 heroin addicts to today above 60 000 heroin addicts that is just in this period that is through adoption of a liberal policy a needle exchange policy and liberalized drug policy deaths also remain constant in baltimore 312 murders in 1997 and 312 in 1998 a liberal policy of failure i have said if we have to have this bill vetoed the district bill with liberal provisions on drug policy 10 more times so let it be but that is part of what the debate is about here that is in spite of people like general barry mccaffrey who is our national drug czar appointed by the president he said by handing out needles we encourage drug use such a message would be inconsistent with the tenure of our national youth oriented antidrug campaign so the drug czar himself has said that we should not liberalize the policy in the district he does not support this move we have others who have attempted a needle exchange and found that they did just the opposite of what they intended to do a montreal study showed that iv addicts who use needle exchange programs were more than twice likely to become infected with hiv as tv addicts who did not use needle exchange programs another study in 1997 in vancouver reported that when their needle exchange programs started in 1988 hiv prevalence in iv drug addicts was only 1 to 2 percent and now it is 23 percent again we believe at least on our side of the aisle that these issues these policies are worth fighting for it is unfortunate that the congress just a few days before the thanksgiving holiday is here but in fact it is important that we are here it is important that we do not allow our nations capital which should be the shining example to return to its former state or to adopt a failed policy of liberalization if the nations capital does not set the example then who does we have taken the district a long way in 4plus short years it was not a shining example when we took over it was a great example of big government going bad that is the same problem we have with many of the other programs public education there has been a tremendous amount of discussion about improving education across our land the federal government today only provides 5 cents of every dollar towards education most of it is provided by local real estate property and state taxes about 95 percent from local and state sources 5 percent by the federal government there has been a debate in the congress here and one of the reasons we are here is how additional money would go to education should it be through more federal programs we had 760 we have gotten that down to 700 since we do not want to spend money on administration we want to spend it on the classroom the question of spending it in the classroom 80 to 90 percent of the money under the democrat regime went for everything except basics except for the classrooms we have tried to turn that around and say that we want at least 90 percent of that money in the classrooms the biggest problem we have in addition to liberal policies being promoted in the washington arena with drugs is just the same problem we face in education where they want the control they want the ability to dictate they want the ability to administer and maintain control in washington that policy has just about been the ruination of public education and also made it most difficult for the teacher to teach in the classroom to have control over the classroom to have some say over the classroom and over the students so with 5 percent of the money the federal government has given us 80 percent of the regulations and 90 percent of the headaches again we do not want that policy adopted either in education programs that come from washington or in programs that dictate how the district of columbia will operate in the future as i close tonight i think that it is important that we realize and this may be the last special order on the drug issue but we realize again the impact of illegal narcotics on our society not only the 15 700 who meet their untimely death by druginduced deaths and that is the latest statistic in the last 6 7 years since i have been in congress there have been 80 000 and 90 000 people that meet their death and final fate through druginduced deaths a startling figure almost as many in any recent war of this nations history the statistics go on to relate the problems that we have i share with my colleagues some of them as i close and these are from our national drug control policy office according to that office each day 8 000 young people will try an illegal drug for the first time for many of them it will be the last time because of those 15 700 deaths many many of them are young people even teenagers today who fall victim to these high purity hard narcotics and unfortunately do not survive according to the office of national drug policy control 352 people start using heroin each day across the united states today we have seen also according to the same office a record number of heroin deaths not only in central florida but throughout this land and again particularly among our young people so we face a great social problem a great challenge i am pleased that we have been able to conduct during the past year a number of hearings we are up to some 18 hearings on the narcotics issue and some 30 hearings we will complete by the first week in december with our subcommittee i appreciate the fine work of staff and members tomorrow our subcommittee will hold a hearing at 10 on the subject of cuba andits involvement in illegal narcotics trafficking the administration this past week and the president did not include cuba in the list of major drug traffickers in spite of some evidence to the contrary we will hear both the gentleman from indiana chairman of the committee on government reform and the gentleman from new york chairman of the committee on international relations on investigations they have conducted by their respective committee staffs on the question bf cubas involvement and complicity in international drug trafficking and also the designation by the white house of those countries who have been designated as major drug traffickers again with the exception of cuba and with specifically excluding cuba from that list so that will be our responsibility then next year we will continue on our quest to find some answers to very serious problems that the american people and certainly the congress of the united states face"], [0.9983966946601868, 0.9983966946601868, 0, "i am pleased to come before the house again on a tuesday night to address the topic that i normally address on tuesday night before the house and to the american people on the subject of illegal narcotics and drug abuse and its effect upon our nation and the responsibility of this congress to address that terrible social problem that we face tonight i would like to provide an update we were in recess during the spring work period and i would like to update the house and again the american people on some of the things that have happened relating to illegal narcotics when i make these presentations i try to look at what has been in the recent news and highlighted sometimes violence which is highlighted unfortunately in our newscasts about what is happening in our society again i think there is no greater social problem facing this nation than that of illegal narcotics it has a dramatic impact on our communities and our children before we left for recess i addressed the house and spoke about the untold story the untold story of a 6yearold bringing a gun into school and shooting a 6yearold and all of the attention focused on the gun we did look a little bit behind the scenes and found that the 6yearold was the victim of a crack house family that was disjointed drugs and narcotics prevalent i believe the father was in jail on a narcotics charge again if we look at the root problem we see narcotics we see again a dysfunctional family and societal problems the gun was the means by which this 6yearold committed a terrible act a murder but the root of the problem is i think what this congress and the american people must focus upon in their attention to correct the situation then i think the american people were focused and the news also riveted in on a 12yearold who brought a gun into school and had his classmates i believe at bay with a weapon and again if we look behind the scenes and i related to the congress we found that the child the 12yearold had taken a gun to school and attempted to get attention and get arrested because he wanted to join his mother who was in jail on a drug charge another incident of illegal narcotics being at the root of the problem the gun manifesting itself again is ceitainly a very serious problem a problemof bringing a weapon into school but again a child with many problems illegal narcotics at the root of some of his family problems then during the holidays right at the season of easter and passover i think the entire nation and the world was focused on washington d c our nations capital which has some of the strongest gun control legislation and laws on the books of any locality in the united states in fact it is almost illegal to own a weapon that is unregistered and there are very tight control laws yet a 16yearold terrorized a family day at the national zoo here in the district of columbia the report of course focused on the young teenager wlo was using a weapon and fired into the crowd but the rest of the story was not told let me just cite a little bit about this young man a 16yearold by the name of jones who was actually the son of an enforcer in the districts biggest drug gang his father was one of the biggest drug gang participants in the 1980s and this young man again was the victim of illegal narcotics and what it had done to his family he was brought up as really the product of illegal narcotics and crime that emanated from illegal narcotics his father this article went on to say james antonio jones was already in jail a source to thefamily confirmed the elder jones 43 is serving a life sentence in a federal maximum security prison in beaumont texas after a 1990 conviction for his role in the drug hierarchy run by raphael edmond who was a notorious drug dealer and head of a crack cocaine gang here in the district of columbia in almost every one of these instances i have cited and others that we see on the nightly news with the attention of the media in fact all of these cases have illegal narcotics at the root of their problems some 70 to 80 percent of those in our prisons in our jails in our federal penitentiaries are there because of drugrelated offenses many would have us believe that these folks are in prison for possessing small amounts of marijuana or some other drug the fact is most of these people are there for repeated felonies some of them in fact have been on drugs when they have committed these repeated crimes many of them have repeated their crimes time and time again are multiple offenders most of the people in our prisons in fact have two or more felony convictions in our federal penitentiaries and state penitentiaries according to the studies that our staff from our subcommittee on criminal justice has undertaken so there are a lot of myths about what is going on there is a lot of misinformation about who is committing crime and these illegal acts in fact we try through these weekly presentations before the house of representatives to get the facts to the american people and the congress again this is the worst social problem that we face it is a horrendous problem the toll is not only those behind bars but those who die annually the most recent statistics that we have on deaths direct deaths from illegal narcotics are 1998 figures and that is 15 973 americans died if we take all of the other deaths related to illegal narcotics people driving under the influence of illegal narcotics people who die as a result of illegal narcotics not necessarily an overdose but some other act total according to our national drug czar barry mccaffrey more than 50 000 almost as many in one year as killed in some of our international conflicts so this indeed is a great it is a problem that can cost our society as much as a quarter of a trillion 250 billion a year that is in dollars and cents not in heartaches to mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers and parents and grandparents who have children and sons and daughters involved in illegal narcotics during this past recess it was my privilege to talk to some of the local law enforcement people in my community i have cited the impact of illegal narcotics in central florida and i represent probably one of the most tranquil areas in the country and in the state of florida and on the east coast and that is the area between orlando and daytona beach central florida has had a heroin epidemic i have cited that before on the floor of the house in the past several years we have had in the neighborhood of 60 deaths from drug overdoses we have had a record number of heroin overdoses and deaths unfortunately i have had to meet with many of the parents who have lost young people to heroin overdoses and they die a horrible death it is none of the glamour that is portrayed by hollywood or by films or the word of mouth that heroin is a great experience it is a horrible experience and a horrible death and any of these parents will testify to that i brought before the house rather gruesome pictures of the results of overdoses of heroin and they are not pretty pictures i hate to bring them backup here again but there is no glamor in death by heroin the heroin that we have on the streets of the united states today is not the low purity heroin that we had in the 1980s now some of the heroin is 80 90 percent pure it is as deadly as any substance can be particularly when used with other drugs or alcohol and first time users unfortunately do not survive in meeting with some of the local law enforcement people we are matching our deaths in central florida again our deaths are record in number our deaths by heroin overdoses now exceed our homicides according to the latest statistics which is absolutely alarming in fact we find the situation getting worse not only in central florida but across the nation in meeting again with these local officials they told me that while the deaths are equal or slightly above previous years death count the only reason they have not shot off the charts even at an even greater rate is the ability of our emergency medical personnel to provide better attention quicker attention and better medical survival equipment available to save more of these individuals the problem we have though is we are seeing more and more incidents emergency room incidents of heroin overdoses we are just able to save a few more folks and the deaths continue to spiral one of the headlines that was in the newspaper just this week in the washington times here which always does such a good job in reporting i brought a copy of this tonight suburban teen heroin use on the increase this is the headline that blurted out this is an absolutely shocking statistic that was presented and this is part of a study that was done i have a copy of the study here it is an interagency domestic heroin threat assessment and these statistics on the increase in illegal narcotics is again quite remarkable if we look at 1996 we had suburban teen heroin use and we are looking at about a half a million young people using heroin that figure has doubled just about to 1 million 980 000 according to this report in a very brief period of time we have had a near doubling of the number of heroin users in the united states teenage heroin users the rate of first use by children aged 12 to 17 increased from less than 1 in 1 000 in the 1980s to 2 7 per thousand in 1996 first time heroin users are getting younger from an average age of 26 year olds in 1991 to an average of 17 years of age by 1997 again some of the statistics from this report are startling again we see teen heroin use on the increase what i also wanted to address tonight is the question of where this heroin is coming from and how did we get into a situation where we have a doubling of the amount of teenagers in our country on heroin unfortunately the chart that i present now shows a rather sad record for the clinton gore administration on the question of longterm prevalence and use of heroin this chart was prepared by monitoring the future study at university of michigan it is not something i made up in a partisan fashion if we look at the chart for a minute we see the percent of 12th graders and if we look at this record here see pretty much stable some downturn some slight increase and then a dramatic downturn under the bush administration it is pretty level and in some cases there are reductions some valleys mostly leveling out and valleys from the reagan and bush administration actually heroin was not quite as much of a problem because president reagan had developed a methadone strategy an interdiction strategy source country programs many of which were eliminated in this period from 1993 forward in 1993 and i have not touched the chart in any way or doctored it you can see a dramatic increase in heroin use we actually see some stabilization here that stabilization and a slight decrease is right after the republicans took over the house and senate and began an effort to restore some of the source country programs the interdiction programs we have also had a tremendous problem in heroin and i will talk about that but part of the broblem that we have is again a lack of attention to heroin and its production and entry into the united states in fact in the same period we have since the beginning of the clinton administration doubled the amount of money on treatment but we have again the situation that we see here we know where the heroin is coming from if we can put this chart up here in 1998 we know today according to this dea drug enforcement administration chart which they have provided me that 65 percent of the heroin that is seized in the united states comes from south america and probably 99 percent of that comes from colombia we know this for a fact they can do a chemical analysis almost a dna analysis and find out almost to the field where the heroin comes from the heroin that is seized across the country samples are sent in to dea and they perform this analysis so we know pretty well the picture of where heroin is coming from it is coming from colombia we also see it coming from mexico the bulk of it of course again is from colombia if we had this chart for 1992 1993 we would see almost no heroin coming from south america in fact heroin was not produced in colombia until the beginning of the clinton administration for all intents and purposes heroin was probably in the single digits from mexico it has crept up a bit since even the last report we had in 1997 it was at 14 percent it is now at 17 percent mexico who we have given incredible trade advantages to this administration has certified repeatedly as far as cooperating in the drug wars now in 1 year increased production by some 20 percent of black tar heroin again we know exactly where this is coming from according to the tests that are conducted this is where heroin is coming from in 1992 almost none of the heroin produced in colombia and single digit in mexico and dramatic increases in both of those countries from both of those countries we know the pattern of drug traffickers let me take this down this is the pattern of drug traffickers we know since 1992 1993 with the election of the gore and clinton team that there was a change in strategy that they wanted to in fact close down the reagan and bush programs for source countries stopping drugs at their source and also interdicting drugs as they came from the source and they effectively did that they closed down most of the international programs slashed the budgets by some 50 percent we know the pattern of heroin coming out of colombia now because we can identify it by the signature program we also know that colombia which was not producing but a small small percentage probably again in single digits of cocaine is now the worlds major producer of cocaine some 80 percent of the cocaine in the world is coming out of colombia this is also since the inception of the clintongore policy where they dismantled these source country programs during the past 4 or 5 years of the republican administration we have made a concerted effort to put back together some of the programs that the clintongore team and the democratcontrolled congress in 2 years did incredible damage to it is a monumental effort it took president reagan most of his term and president bush to get the illegal narcotics problem in the right direction and that is on a downward trend again these are not doctored in any way these are not partisan charts this chart also produced by the university of michigan shows the record and it is a very clear record i know this drives the clintongore people crazy and it drives the people on the other side of the aisle the liberal side who changed policy crazy but this shows very clearly that with president reagan we see the longterm trend and prevalence of drug use this really is the major measure of what is going on with illegal narcotics we see it going down in a steady fashion under president reagan we see a dramatic drop under president bush an incredible job here done then again undoctored and we do not play with any of these charts but the facts are very clear that again with president clinton with the closedown of the interdiction programs the source country programs taking the military out cutting the coast guard budget all this was done in a very short period of time but the damage has been absolutely incredible when the republicans took over having participated in this we knew that this policy needed to be reversed under the leadership of the now speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois who chaired the subcommittee that i now chair actually the responsibility for drug policy it was a different title it is now titled the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources but the gentleman from illinois was the one responsible along with his predecessor mr zeliff who left the congress in restarting the war on drugs this is basically the war on drugs and we will hear people say the war on drugs was a failure if this is a failure i am either reading the chart wrong and we can bring back the heroin chart we also have them for cocaine and other narcotics this is pretty dramatic and pretty evident of a successful program again the use of illegal narcotics is going down down down this certainly has to be a patent failure with the clintongore administration by any measure li 2145 it is interesting that if we looked at the resources that were committed again this chart is not doctored it shows the exact figures in the millions of dollars for international programs now when we think about drug programs we spend billions and billions in drug program it costs us billions and billions of dollars here we have a chart that starts out with about 600 million in international source country programs these programs were started under president reagan and president bush to stop drugs at their source because it really is the most costeffective way where drugs are produced by peasants in peru bolivia colombia these peasants get very few pesos or the equivalent of dollars for their harvest and we know that 100 percent of the cocaine comes from peru bolivia and colombia one hundred percent maybe i should say 99 99 percent maybe there is a little bit on the slopes of ecuador or some other bordering country but it all comes from that region we know that the programs under president bush and president reagan worked we know that the programs under president clinton have not worked in eliminating international drug programs or slashing them here we can see from this chart 19921993 here and again with a democratcontrolled congress implementing their policy and gutting the international programs to less than half of what they were we see increases with the advent of the republican majority we are back up to and if we take this 1999 dollars and put it into 1991 dollars we are just about back at 1991 levels but this is a clear pattern if we took this and did an overlay with the previous chart we can see that as they cut drug use here they had those programs in place as they took the programs for international out of place the drug use started to soar and that is because we had an even greater supply coming this chart shows federal spending for interdiction also gutted by the democratcontrolled congress gutted here in 1993 it looks a little delayed but we have to remember that we start a fiscal year a little bit later like we will start the next one in october of this year but we can see the devastation of the cuts in interdiction programs here and we see getting back to the equivalent of the 1991 figures actually if we look at this little peak that we have gotten to here it coincides with the slight downturn that we have seen here in drug use also if i got the heroin chart out we would see some stabilization the problem we have in heroin is that heroin is now produced in colombia in incredible quantities the quantity is completely uncontained as far as coming into the united states because the clinton administration has thwarted every single attempt up to i would say last october when the situation in colombia got totally out of hand colombia is about to lose its country we sent the drug czar down we have sent other officials down but the policy of the clintongore administration the democratcontrolled congress was one of one error after another in colombia first we stopped information sharing with colombia back in 1994 which brought the outrage even from democrat members of the congress that was information sharing which we provide through interdiction and we can see if we look at this interdiction chart we see the gutting of the interdiction program our military does not get involved in an enforcement manner in the narcotics issue it is prohibited from actually conducting law enforcement by the constitution we do not want the military in law enforcement but what the military does is surveillance in the international area outside our borders if we had missiles coming in that were killing 15 973 citizens in one year 100 000 in7 years and 50 000 deaths related to that action we certainlywould use our national security forces what we do is we use the military to conduct surveillance our planes provide that information to other countries we again through the republican new majority started programs for source country for interdiction restarted them in 1996 and 1997 for peru and for bolivia those programs have been phenomenally successful the amount of cocaine has been cut production in bolivia has been cut some 55 percent in peru we are up in the 65 percent 66 percent range the only change that we have seen is further cuts of providing this interdiction and surveillance information to peru and there have been some downturns in the united states providing that information we immediately see some increase in drug trafficking or drug production it is almost guaranteed to happen according to again all the research and evidence and information that we have so where we let up we in fact have illegal narcotics coming into this country nothing is more evident than colombia again in 1994 the administration stopped information sharing the next thing they did was they decertified colombia without a national interest waiver which meant that we could not send assistance to colombia to fight illegal narcotics in colombia illegal narcotics and the narcoterrorist activity that has caused tens of thousands of deaths and disruption of that country are synonymous the narcoterrorists fund their terrorist activities through narcotics trafficking that is wellknown the right and the left extreme right and extreme left in that civil war fund their activities through narcotics trafficking narcotics taxes and income from the production of narcotics we know it our drug czar has stated that many times that is why it has become in the united states national interest to provide assistance to colombia to stop the narcotics trafficking stop the terrorist activities that are going on there not to provide any troops or any active military participation there we have agreed to provide some training but year after year since 1993 with the clintongore administration they have stopped resources getting to colombia the results are very evident we have again production from no production in colombia of heroin to now producing some 65 percent probably closer to 70 percent of the heroin where there was almost none cocaine we have some 80 percent now being produced in colombia before it was being transshipped through colombia from peru and bolivia and we do know that the program instituted by the republican majority has worked very well in those countries to cut production but right now the reason we have this report on heroin flooding our streets young people being victimized and dying at incredible numbers from heroin is the sheer quantity the sheer supply now it is bad enough that we have this record of all of these activities being stopped here which has allowed some of this to happen but what is even worse is the reaction of the administration to provide assets if we are going to fight a war on drugs or if we are going to fight a war we need assets and we need to have those assets committed to that war effort this chart is part of a report that was prepared at my request by the general accounting office in december of 1999 what this chart shows is the various assets some of these are dod this is the dod assets which have been dedicated to the war on drugs and we see this decline from 1993 here this continuous decline of dod assets to the war on drugs the next little triangle the yellow triangle the customs service assets declining some beginning of increase with the republican majority and the gentleman from illinois was responsible for this we see the beginning of the return back to this 1992 level the coast guard we see steady decline if we took the budgets for these various agencies we would see them gutted by the clintongore administration and also by the democratically controlled congress so if we have a war on drugs we must commit assets the report that i had conducted said that flight hours have been reduced 68 percent for fiscal years 1992 to 1999 so this is flying hours dedicated to tracking suspect shipments of illegal narcotics in transit to the united states the number declined from 46 264 to 14 770 so i submit that the war on drugs was a success but basically closed down by this administration and this is pretty good evidence the other area if drugs are not shipped by air they ship by sea i also asked gao to look at trafficking patterns and also what we were doing as far as providing assets in the war on drugs as far as maritime activities if we look again from soxm of these highs here we see dod in the red declining and a steady decline of ship days if if we look at the coast guard we see some slight increase this follows the other pattern and the total overall is still below what it was in in fact the report given to me indicates that assets that were used in shipping and going after illegal narcotics declined some 62 percent during this period from 1992 to 1999 so the ship days for going after illegal narcoticsand those resources in a war on drugs declined dramatically during that period one of the other problems that we have had in the war on illegal drugs is the failure of this administration to negotiate with panama the location and continued operation of our antinarcotics operations centers which were located in panama these are known as fols forward operating locations in order to conduct a war on illegal narcotics we need information and surveillance from the area where illegal drugs are produced and also shipped out of that particular setting in may of 1999 of course the united states was forced to stop all flights the administration bungled the negotiations with panama we encouraged them to at least negotiate an arrangement where we could continue our narcotics tracking flights out of that area since may of 1999 we have seen not a total shutdown but a dramatic increase again as documented by this gao report our illegal narcotics heroin cocaine are coming in from colombia in unprecedented volumes it is absolutely mind boggling the sheer amount of heroin and cocaine that is coming in but one sees that we do not have the locations now this chart shows coverage with potential fols and this chart was given to me as showing the congress and our committee what would be done to relocate those operations for surveillance and important interdiction information one of the locations proposed was in manta ecuador the other was in curacao and aruba unfortunately the manta location in ecuador and also the location in aruba dutch antilles took longer than anticipated to negotiate final agreements the cost by the time we are through with relocating here will be 128 million since the manta air strip is not adequate to land the heavy planes and equipment that we have aruba will have to build additional facilities but we have dramatically cut the number of flights the number of surveillance missions because we do not have these two locations in operation it may be 2002 before actually both of these are up and running at full capacity that is why we have the report of incredible amounts of heroin and still cocaine coming into the united states we have nothing in place to stop it today i met with the representatives of the department of defense and various agencies involved in trying to put together a program to put humpty dumpty back together again to try to get us back to the 1992 levels in this fight we now have recently signed but not fully approved by the el salvador legislature a third location this will cost us another 10 million or 15 million in addition to losing the panama location and 5 billion worth of assets there we will now pay to relocate these operations but nothing will stop narcotics quicker than either eradicating them at their source or getting them as they come from their source it is proven effective in peru it is proven effective in bolivia it will prove effective in colombia and the surrounding areas and stop some of the incredible supply that is driving down the price and making more of the drugs available to our young people again my colleagues saw the figures of a doubling in just several years of heroin abuse but this is where it is coming from unfortunately all of this will not be in place for several years to get us back to where we were in 1992 in our operations in the antinarcotics effort what is sad too is that this administration continues to thwart the will and recommendations of congress we have attempted for some 4 or 5 years i know since we took over the majority in every fashion including granting appropriations to get resources to colombia and to the area where illegal narcotics are coming from but this gao report also outlines that dod is not providing assets that are requested when we question the various agencies where these assets are in fact the assets are going to bosnia the assets are going to the middle east the assets are going to kosovo they are going to the record number of deployments under the clintongore administration this is quite telling because southcom which is the southern unitedstates command in charge of basically our war on drugs and our antinarcotics effort has been requesting assets these are assets dod assets towards the war on drugs this is in the blue the red shows what they got and what was provided as far as assets in this effort we see that this is the request and this is what they got in 1999 this is the request and this is what they got so if my colleagues are wondering why they have heroin on their streets if they are wondering why they have record number of teenagers using heroin and illegal drugs this is because even though the congress has appropriated funds and resources we cannot get those resources into this program i do not know if it is the secretary of defense but i fear that it is even higher in the administration because again every effort to get resources to stop these drugs and the sheer incredible supply coming into our country every effort is thwarted it has almost reached comical proportions as i cited and it would be funny if there were not so many people dying as a result of this the helicopters that we requested for the colombia national police for some 4 or 5 years now finally got there late this past fall unfortunately as we now know the ammunition for those helicopters was delivered to the back door of the state department in a bungled operation rather than to colombia it would almost be humorous to find out that those helicopters were sent to colombia and they were not properly armored so they could not be used in the antinarcotics effort finally i believe we now have those resources in place the administration did become aware of the destabilization of the area and what was going on in columbia and finally asked for a supplemental package unfortunately the president did not submit finally to congress until the time of our budget and that was several months ago a request and that unfortunately now is being handled through the regular funding process although it is necessary to move that package forward to get these assets in place one of the things that does disturb me is some of the liberalizers out there and those who would legalize and propose that the solution to all this is just legalize what are now illegal narcotics and all of our problems will be solved i think that an article that i read by a professor at pepperdine university james q wilson had some interesting information i justwanted to cite him tonight he said advocates of legalization think that both buyers and sellers would benefit by legalization people who can buy drugs freely and at something like at free market prices would no longer have to steal to afford cocaine or heroin dealers would no longer have to use violence and corruption to maybe obtain their market share though drugs may harm people reducing this harm would be a medical problem and you always hear the legalizers say it is a medical problem not a criminal justice one crime would drop sharply but there is an error in this calculation again this is what professor wilson is saying legalizing drugs means letting the price fall to its competitive rate plus taxes and ad vertising costs that market price would probably be somewhere between onethird and onetwentieth of the illegal price and more than the market price would fall as harvards mark moore pointed out the risk price that is all the hazards associated with buying the drugs from being arrested to being ripped off would also fall and this decline might be more important than the lower purchase price under a legal regime the consumption of lowpriced lowrisk drugs would increase dramatically we do not know by how much but the little evidence we have suggests a sharp rise until 1968 britain allowed doctors to prescribe heroin some doctors cheated and their medically unnecessary prescriptions helped increase the number of known heroin addicts by a factor of 40 as a result the government abandoned the prescription policy in favor of administering heroin in clinics and later replacing heroin with methadone when the netherlands ceased enforcing laws against the purchase or possession of marijuana the result was a sharp increase in its use cocaine and heroin create much greater dependency so the increase in their use would probably be even greater the average user would probably commit fewer crimes if these drugs were sold legally but the total number of users would increase sharply a large fraction of these new users would be unable to keep a steady job unless we were prepared to support them with welfare payments crime would be one of their major sources of income that is the number of drugrelated crimes per user might fall even as the total number of drugrelated crimes increased add to the list of harms more deaths from overdose more babies born to addicted mothers more accidents by druginfluenced automobile drivers and fewer people able to hold jobs or act as competent parents i think that this observation by professor wilson is quite interesting it is also borne by the facts where they have tried liberalized policy in the united states i bring out the chart provided to me by dea our drug enforcement agency which shows that heroin addict population of baltimore now baltimore until just recently had a very liberal mayor mayor schmoke he actually turned his back on enforcement of some of the illegal narcotics trafficking and use and abuse in his community the results were incredible the number of deaths in 1997 1998 were 312 1999 when we got these figures the end oflast year were 308 it will probably reach 312 because people die as a result of some wound inflicted on them but the deaths are pretty much stable but what has happened in baltimore with this liberal policy is absolutely astounding and it is confirmed by what professor wilson had outlined in his statement of what happens if we look at baltimore in the 1950s it had almost a million population in 1996 it was down to 675 000 we will know what the population is now but we think it is down lower around 600 000 in 1996 it had 38 985 heroin addicts again this is during the period of the liberal attitude towards illegal narcotics that estimate is now 1999 somewhere in the neighborhood of one in eight citizens this is not something i have made up it is something a city source we are getting them back to council person has said one in eight the 199192 funding levels for the proare now addicted in what is left of bal grams of interdiction of stopping timore wadrugs cost effectively as they come so exactly what the experience was from those source country areas where in england we see an increase dra they are produced the republican mamatic increase in the addiction popu jority has instituted and funded lation if this was multiplied across the through appropriations a billion dolunited states and we had one in eight lars a national drug education propeople in the united states addicted to gram unprecedented in the history of heroin or illegal narcotics we would this country and we have again drahave a disaster on our hands this is matically increased the amount of again the model of a liberal approach money for treatment and other proa liberal approach that failed both in grams deaths and addiction i do not think so i am proud of our record and will one can have more horrible results continue next week to cite the drug what is interesting and most people problem that we have facing this nalike to ignore particularly the liberal tion crowd or those that want to gang up on i have run out of timae so i will yield rudy giuliani these days is the tough back first thanking those enforcement the zero tolerance policy who are working tonight for their padoes it work or does it not work if my tience colleagues will look in the early 1990s when rudy giuliani took over as mayor they see about 2 000 plus deaths special orders granted from murders the crime rate in new by unanimous consent permission to york city address the house following the legisthe zero tolerance has brought that down to the mid 600 range an absolutely dramatic decrease in murders in that city what is amazing is not only the murders have decreased but in every other major crime area crime is down by some 50 percent to 1999 during his tenure and what is interesting is i know that people pick on mr giuliani and say that there is overenforcement and our subcommittee did hearings and we updated that information we did hearings a year ago when he was accused of some of his police force being overzealous in their enforcement and we found that there were in fact fewer incidences of police firing on individuals under rudy giuliani we found there were fewer incidences of complaints against police and actually that was while mr giuliani had increased the police force by some 25 percent in numbers so actually the number of police on duty had increased and there were far fewer complaints under mr giuliani than there were under the former administrations of the city again the figures for the new york city police department are absolutely incredible zero tolerance tough enforcement does work in 1993 there were 429 000 major felony crimes committed in 1998 we have 212 an incredible record the liberals would have us believethat the legalization is the answer in fact the liberalization has almost devastated the city of baltimore and other settings where they have attempted a liberal policy the tough enforcement the zero tolerance in fact does work and does result in dramatic decreases in crime across the board i am very pleased that the republican majority has increased the source country programs that are so effective in stopping illegal narcotics at their lative program and any special orders heretofore entered was granted to"], [0.9983431100845337, 0.9983431100845337, 0, "and reclaiming my time once again that 1 that the gentleman held up we hear from the democratic leadership through the propaganda going across this country that that dollar is going to be used to reduce the federal debt what the gentleman said and he is absolutely correct if we leave that 1 here in washington dc it will not go for reducing the national debt it will go for new programs and for new spending when we leave money around here the new spending is a temptation i am sure the gentleman knows this at least as it applies to me when i have people come into my office asking for new spending these usually are not bad programs they usually sound great e0 2200 but the question is can we afford them so the temptation to spend those dollars will fall on republicans and democrats back here it is a strong temptation we have a lot of our constituents out there who if that dollar stays here they say the dollar is going to stay in washington let us spend it for this program or let us spend it for that program we all know that if we leave that dollar here it will grow the size of the government what the republicans are pushing for and we are having a tough time getting our message across because it is very easy to spend it in 15 seconds what the gentleman from the dakotas and myself are trying to explain in 30 minutes but the fact is if we leave that dollar in your pocket in your community it would work much better the only way that theory would not work is if when keeping that dollar in your community in your pocket you went out and buried it in the ground literally put it in the ground other than it is either going to a bank which will loan it back out to the community it is going to be spent for goods and services which circulate in the community do my colleagues know what they should do sometimes some of these companies have to pay taxes they should pay their employees in 2 bills we still have a 2 bill out there pay in 2 bills and see how often and how many places those 2 bills show up in your community and how many weeks those 2 bills are showing up in stores and all kinds of different places in your community versus coming back here to washington i hope the gentleman stays i want to point out a couple of other things on taxes we have just gotten from the tax foundation and the tax foundation has a lot of credibility back here it is a nonpartisan organization we have just received in 1999 what americans per capita will spend on things such as food clothing and shelter i want to show my colleagues some very stunning numbers i will write them here very quickly for you on food in 1999 2 693 that is what the average per capita expenditure in the united states will be for food for clothes that will be 1 404 so for food per capita we are going to spend 2 693 for clothes we are going to spend 1 404 and for shelter we will spend 5 833 now if we add that up assuming my math is right that is 9 930 per capita so food is 2 693 clothes are 1 404 and shelter is 5 833 that is what you spend for those priority items in your family guess what you will pay for taxes 10 298 in other words the per capita expenditure per family in this country you will pay more for taxes than you do for your food your clothes and your shelter combined again let me repeat that we will all pay more in taxes than we will pay for our food our clothes and our shelter now we will also another interesting thing when you look at these numbers put out by the tax group on federal taxes alone we will spend more than any other major budget item i want to put some examples out here for housing we will spend the 5 833 for health care 3 829 for food 2 693 for transportation 2 568 for recreation 1 922 for clothing 1 404 for federal taxes alone just for federal taxes here is what we spend for federal taxes 7 000 so think about your budget think about what you are spending in your family budget these are roughly the figures that you will come up with housing 5 833 you spend more in taxes than you do in housing for your f6mily health care for your family you will spend about 3 829 this is per capita you will spend a little over twice that for taxes not quite twice 7 026 for food to feed the family per capita 2 693 compared to what kou are going to have to pay in taxes 7 026 for recreation 1 922 compared tothe 7 000 you are going to pay in taxes for clothing 1 404 to clothe your family per capita and you are going to spend over 7 000 in taxes my point is this there has been a lot of rhetoric lately about if we do not provide some kind of tax relief for the american people then we hear from the democratic party leadership that the federal debt will only increase and they all of a sudden the democrat leadership after 40 years of running deficits in this country now some of my colleagues do not like to hear partisanship and i am not trying to be partisan but the fact is the republicans did not run this house for 40 years they have run it for 5 years and we have had surpluses on almost all of those years we have had welfare reform we had the tax cut i spoke about earlier but the reality what people do not want you to hear is that guess what when we reduce your taxes when we allow you to keep those dollars in your pockets guess what happens the economy improves take a look at any major tax relief or tax reduction in this century or in the century before it but since income tax came in this century take a look at any one of them immediately after a tax reduction the economy improved when those dollars again unless you bury your dollars in the ground and you never see them again or you hide them and do not circulate them in your community then in any other circumstance that will one keep down the size of government and two bring up the health of the economy now we have got a pretty good economy not everybody my good friend from the dakotas talks about the agriculture and the suffering and they are suffering out in the farm belt but there are a lot of people who are enjoying the healthiest many of them they will ever experience in their entire life so they do not worry so much about taxes well you pay a little tax here you pay a little tax here let me tell you what is happening while some of you are asleep the governments whether it is a local government whether it is a local district whether it is a state government or whether it is the federal government is sneaking into your house while you are asleep and those taxes are going up most of the increase that you have seen in your taxes the total tax package has occurred since 1981 most of that increase 45 percent 45 percent of the taxes that you pay are as a result of tax increases since 1981 all we are saying here is let us not fall asleep while the tax man sneaks in behind us now are taxes necessary of course they are necessary we have certain responsibilities that belong to the federal government a strong military i think we have a fundamental obligation for good education in this country we do have some health care obligations we have transportation obligations for the interstate highways interstate commerce we have a justice system that has to be maintained so there are some fundamental obligations that the federal government must maintain there are certainly obligations that the state government must maintain we agree with those our local districts our school districts have a very heavy burden ir providing what we want and that is quality education those dollars have to go in but it does not mean we should overpay and it does not mean when we pay our tax we should not ask our elected officials am i paying too much am i getting a fair shake for my dollar am i gettingefficient use out of that dollar is that dollar more productive in washington d c or is it more productive in my home state of santa clara california or salt lake city utah or kansas city kansas or carbondale colorado is this where those dollars are most efficient so my colleagues i am just trying to say to my colleagues here as this rhetoric goes on about the tax cut and how it is going to add to the federal debt take a look at the details read the fine print when you read the fine print you are going to find out frankly really there are two choices one continue to grow the government or two give back a portion of the surplus not all of the surplus but give back a portion ofthe surplus to the people who earned it tax dollars are taxed to spend that is the only reason we get taxed it is the only reason our constituents out there get taxed the only reason you are being taxed is so that some governmental body can spend that money and as we said earlier some of those expenses are justified some of them are necessary but if you tend to allow accountability to become lax or the old saying that when the cat is away the mice will play if you do not keep the cat in the barn the mice pretty soon get out of control what we are saying here is let us exercise prudent financial management and let us tell our clients the constituents the taxpayers you overpaid for this product you deserve a little of it back we still want to give you a fine product you deserve it from the government but at this point you have overpaid a little not a lot the tax decrease we are talking about does not do a lot but it still keeps a few of those dollars in your pocket i have had a recent opportunity about 3 years ago and this is exciting regardless of what party you are in regardless of your bent toward partisan politics i have got something that i hope all of my colleagues take a very careful look at it has been a tremendously successful program in my district and i would like to explain it to my colleagues it is called the s e e d s program i actually started that program in the third congressional district of colorado with the help of a lot of people susan smith the city of pueblo county of pueblo several school districts pueblo community college roger gomez a number of different people we all got together and we found out that under the federal regulations you can ask federal agencies for their excess computer equipment in other words we have for example the department of energy who has been very cooperative with us they have excess computer equipment some of this equipment is almost brand new now this is not stateoftheart computer equipment but most schools in our country do not have stateoftheart computer equipment in fact in my district there were a number of schools that did not have really any computer equipment so what we did on our drive to cut down government waste is we went to these different agencies and we said we would like you to ship those computers to a warehouse which by the way was donated to our cause in pueblo colorado send them to our warehouse we got students from pueblo community college to come in and help us put part a of the computer with part b so on and so forth we got citizens to help us haul away the trash we got citizens to help come down and do the mechanical work we got citizens to volunteer and come down and help us match up the computers with schools that needed these computers and before you know it our program was off and running what were the results of our program in our program in colorado now we are up to 200 sets of computers a week that we give to local schools not just public school private schools home schoolers senior citizens it is an exciting project it provides a need for education which we think is very important nobody disagrees that education is not important and it takes away budget waste government waste wasteful spending which i think most of us would agree is not necessary we take that waste and we convert it to a good positive use it is called the s e e d s program i am here this evening to tell my constituents to tell my colleagues here on the house floor this is a program you should adopt you should take a look at i would like to cover another area tonight there has been some recent press publicity about a stand i have taken in regards to our military academies let me precede my comments on the academies with the statement about the military we need in this country the strongest military second to none in the world do not let people kid you it would be a very terrible mistake for us to allow our military to fall into shambles and to become the second toughest kid on the block you cannot be the second toughest kid on the block you cannot be the third toughest kid on the block you have got to be the toughest kid on the block it does not mean you go pick fights but it does mean you will be in less fights because people will not want to fight you it also means that you can go out and help those people that are less fortunate because of your strength i believe in a strong military and all of us should believe in a strong military for too many years the military has not received the kind of priority that is necessary although the military for too many years has been called to different missions all over the world i think right now we are stationed in 164 different locations so i have great respect for the military but i also believe that the military has accountability i want to talk for a couple of minutes about our service academies it is a great honor to be selected to go to the united states service academies west point the air force academy the naval academy the unitedstates coast guard the students that go there are not the cream of the crop i repeat that they are not the cream of the crop they are the cream of the cream of the crop we take our very best students and when we focus in on the students that we want to send to those military academies i think there are a lot of things we need to look at and list in order of priority leadership skills obviously intelligence capabilities and maybe somewhere on the list further down on the list there are sports abilities or their celebrity status on sports here is what is happening this is my point that i disagreed very strongly with on some of the academies when someone enters say the air force academy you make a commitment to the united states of america you sign a deal with them it is fully disclosed there is nothing hidden about it you tell the united states in this case air force academy i will serve so many years in exchange for those 4 years of college education that the american people are giving me as a privilege and it is a privilege we pick great young men and women to be in the service but you sign this commitment and just to be sure you fully understand that commitment after 2 years of being in say the unitedstates air force academy we say to the students look you can walk away no strings attached or we want you to make sure that you make an informed decision that if you continue at the air force academy and complete your 4 years education you will have a commitment of service you will have an obligation you will have a duty these students by the way live under an ethical code or a military code or an academy code that says service to the nation over self well what i have discovered is happening is if you are in a very special class of people at the air force academy for example you get treated differently than the other cadets what am i talking about if everyone was listening to me earlier this evening i talked about heroes we had two heroes in grand junction colorado they lost their lives i like sports i enjoy the broncos i am a fan of the broncos but even my favorite sports person to me is a celebrity not a hero but what happens at the academies if you are a celebrity sports person for example an outstanding football player who has an opportunity to be drafted by the pros you are going to get special treatment or some of them have received special treatment by the air force academy for example that lets them walk away from their service commitment now they have to serve some time in the reserves but they are not treated like every other cadet out there now some people say well it is good publicity for us it is necessary that we allow these academy graduates to walk away or be waivered that is the keyword that is the buzz word be waivered from their duty and their service so that we get publicity in the pro football circuit my comment to that was well if we need publicity why do we not just go ahead and let united airlines for example or any airline i fly united a lot let any airline go to the air force academy and say we would like your top pilots go ahead and waive their service we will pay them money even though these athletes are not having to pay their 120 000 which is the payback financially to the government we will go ahead we like your top pilots do you think the air force academy would release those pilots not on your life if dow chemical corporation or some other chemical company and i like dow chemical if they went to the air force academy and said we would like your top chemists give us your top chemist students do you think they would waiver those students out of there not on your life let me read from an editorial rocky mountain news a perk for military athletes roger staubach graduated from the naval academy served his obligatory 4 years on active duty and still enjoyed an 11year career with the dallas cowboys that put him in the pro football hall of fame times have changed beau morgan the air force academys star quarterback from the class of 1997 was let out of what is now a 5year commitment after only 2 years so he could try out with the dallas cowboys this summer it is part of a trend that apparently began in 1989 when the naval academy graduate david robinson was released after just 2 years active duty enabling him to play with the nbas san antonio spurs now an angry unitedstates representative scott mcinnis republican of colorado is threatening to introduce legislation that would put an end to this practice when these kids go to the academy we try and teach them that you put your nation above yourself but that is not what is occurring here there are a number of other examples steve russ a line backer with the denver broncos was released from his military commitment in 1997 2 years after his air force academy graduation air force academy grad dan palmer also got an early out to try out with the chicago bears as an offensive lineman for 2 years mcinnis has been trying to use the freedom of information act to get a complete list of those who received waivers from service academies for athletic purposes but he is having a hard time of it it is easy to understand why the military schools might be tempted to fudge the rules in order to entice more athletes for decades they played at the top levels of intercollegiate athletics but that is no longer true a military career is just not as attractive to top athletes as it once was frustrated academy graduates who are now generals and admirals want to do what they can to slow or reverse the trend the military tries to justify the current policy by saying that their star athletes serve effectively as academy recruiters upon their early release but we suspect the kids they mainly recruit are other outstanding athletes who will also expect early releases those who get releases after signing pro contracts do not have to repay the 120 000 cost of their education and they do not have to go back to active duty even if they are later cut by their teams their only obligation is to spend 6 years in the reserves if pro athletes serve as effective recruiters says mcinnis why not let united airlines recruit the top pilots from the air force academy so long as they say on the airplane you are being flown by an air force academy graduate mcinnis dismisses the suggestion that early releases might be all right if the graduate or his employer simply repays the government the cost of his or her education the economics of professional athletes are such that 120 000 is merely quote what professional teams spend on refreshments at weekend resorts unquote the point says mcinnis is that academy athletes deserve no privileges that other graduates cannot get it is just wrong he says of the earlyrelease policy it makes me mad considering the athletes the major state universities recruit how little some of them study and how few of them ultimately graduate the service academies should not be ashamed that their cadets can no longer compete at that level if they have to play smaller schools it is no disgrace but the earlyout policy for their athletes is a disgrace and should be stopped folks my point is very clear we are proud of these academies the air force academy and west point and the coast guard and the naval academy have served this country very well our great military leaders some of our presidents many of our great leaders in this country have come from those academies why because when you go to an academy it is a pretty special place it has the highest of standards and it has the highest of ethical codes i think we are diluting that i think we are diluting the reputation of all the preceding graduates of these academies for the entire history of those academies by taking a special class of athletes and treating them differently by letting them out of their obligations early again remember we do not do it for any other class of air force or naval or west point or coast guard academy graduate it is wrong we should stand up and say to the american people you can expect more from our academies i want to mention a couple of other things in conclusion this evening first of all as i said earlier i come from the third district of colorado this is a very special season coming up in colorado so i am going to do a little promotion i hope all of my colleagues have an opportunity to go out and see our colors in the aspen trees the district i represent is the highest district in the united states they have a lot of beautiful communities a lot of great ski resorts aspen sonoma steamboat telluride i will get in trouble because i do not name them all but virtually every ski resort in colorado is in that district so if my colleagues get an opportunity we invite them to come out to colorado come and visit us come and see whatbeauty we have out there but i also want to point out something else when my colleagues head out of this city take a look at how important it is that we allow the average working joe and the average working jane in this country to be promised and to expect fair treatment by their government when it comes to taxes every government leader out there should understand that they have a fiduciary duty an obligation to try and deliver the most efficient services the government can at the least amount of cost and every government official out there has an obligation to you the working joe and the working jane the people that provide these dollars there is an obligation on behalf of every elected or every government employee or every government official to make sure that you are not being overcharged there is an obligation by every one of us in these chambers to look at that taxpayer and we ought to say thank you to them we ought to say thank you to the working people of this country because if it were not for the 8 or 12 or 14 hours they work every day 5 or 6 or 7 days a week that money to provide for the programs that we run out of these chambers would not be here we owe them a big thank you and we also owe them the duty to make sure that when we spend those dollars we spend them effectively that we are fair to the taxpayer our system needs taxes it has to operate with taxes but our system has a fundamental requirement of fairness and openness to the people that send that money to washington and when we have an opportunity to send that money and put it back in the pocketbooks of those hard working americans that provide those dollars we should take it"], [0.99825119972229, 0.99825119972229, 0, "this evening i want to talk about a number of different subjects i was not going to talk about education until i heard some of the previous comments and i think it is important to clarify some of those comments that were made and talk about the direction that the republican party is going in regards to education those remarks will be somewhat brief i then want to cover the topic that we have seen with the brooklyn museum in new york city i am going to move from that subject to a subject that i think will be very uplifting to all of my colleagues and that is the third congressional district of colorado we are going to talk about natural resources as we can see with this picture i have behind me that is what that district looks like we are going to get into much more detail about that cover the water issues cover the federal land management issues and so on so i think it is going to be a very interesting hour i look forward to the participation of my colleagues but let me begin first of all by talking about the preceding comments first of all it is important that our friends and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle from north carolina understand that everybody across this country 49 states across this country are going to pitch in for that one state that got hit as devastating as north carolina north carolina you are not alone you are in the united states and in the united states of america we are a team and we stick together and we help the other states when the other states are in need of help i would expect the other states to help me in colorado if we had some sort of a disaster that is why we are the united states of america so the preceding speaker who spoke on north carolina bless her i understand the tragedies that she is going through i do not live there but we are willing to help make it right everybody in this chamber is willing to help make it right for north carolina but let me talk just for a moment about the kind of disaster aid and when we do this we must be careful we still have a fiduciary responsibility to the people who have elected us to make sure that that money gets to the people that need it we have a fiduciary responsibility to minimize if not eliminate government waste so if we ask for accountability on these disaster funds do not come back at us and say my gosh you do not care about the poor people who have suffered these tragedies you know that often happens in government business the minute you question a program for accountability for efficiency to see whether or not you have got waste to see whether or not those dollars are going to the people that need the dollars or the people for whom the dollars were intended the minute you question it all of a sudden you are cold and heartless and you do not care about these people that are in these tragic situations we have an obligation to make sure that money goes where it is needed and where it is going to do the most good so do not be upset or offended if we ask some pretty tough questions about how these dollars are being spent which leads me into education it is amazing to me that the democrats can stand up here on this house floor and say that they are the only ones for education and that this side is antieducation how many people think of it how many people have you ever run into that will tell you they are against education you do not run into people that are against education education is a critical mass for the success of this country it is absolutely essentially for the future of this country it is what gave many of us in this country a base from which to operate because we learned something because the generations ahead of us taught us and made sure we had good schools we on the republican side and the democrat side feel an obligation to make sure that education is the best well let me tell my colleagues there are some things we need to do in the classroom and some people disagree with that but on the republican side we feel we have to put discipline back in the classroom and if you do not believe me take a look at what the disciplinary problems were 20 years ago and take a look at what they are today and take a look at the difference in discipline allowed to the school teacher who has a very difficult job take a look at the discipline he orshe is allowed to exercise in her classroom compared to the discipline that he or she was allowed 20 years ago i can tell you when i was in the 7th grade i got in a fight on the school ground it meant an automatic swat on the butt with a board i remember that to this day now i cannot tell you i did not get in any more fights but i sure did not get in any more fights on school grounds because we had some discipline in the classroom the republicans feel that is an important issue and we do not think that you are antieducation if you say let us give the teachers the tools they need to have discipline in the classroom i urge the democrats to join with us frankly some of the conservative democrats do there is nothing wrong with telling our young people you must behave there are certain behavioral standards that you have to live up to and if you do not live up to these standards there are consequences there is punishment because our primary purpose is to educate you to the highest degree possible a second point we should make about some of the previous comments early in thislast hour you know you do not make schools better by just necessarily throwing more money at all what happens around here the minute you question a budget for education the minute you stand up and question are we wasting the money is the money producing results is the money accounted for is the money getting down to the classroom and not being spent in the administration is it really going to the classroom the minute you ask those questions and primarily those questions are asked by republicans the democrats primarily rush right up and put a label on you antieducation you know what we can make a better educational system in this country if we demand accountability if we see where those dollars are going and make sure they are being spent efficiently if we allow those dollars to get into the classroom that is how we are going to make a difference in education i think it is very important that we also recognize that there are alternatives to public education now i am not against public education i have three children my youngest child andrea is a senior in high school my son dax is a junior at colorado state university and my daughter tessa is a junior at bryant college in providence rhode island my point is this all three of loris my wife and my children all three of those children went to public schools now they had the option to go to private school but we were very confidentin our local public schools and in the schools that they went to throughout their schooling career but the point is we should not take away from the people who want to homeschool i want to say to my democrat colleagues who were criticizing the republicans it was your side of the aisle just a few short years ago that went out and said if you are a homeschooler you should have to be licensed in every subject you teach in other words a father or a mother who wants to stay home and homeschool their children would have to be licensed or certified in math or science or physical education whatever they taught that child they had to be certified what did that mean it meant the elimination of homeschooling that is exactly what it meant i am saying tomy colleagues on the democratic side come work with us in a bipartisan fashion do not just think that public education is the only way to go obviously it is the most significant mode of education in this country and obviously we need to make it as good as we can and obviously it is going to cost us a lot of dollars on the other hand i think i can use the word obviously in most cases homeschooling is doing a darn good job look at the test results obviously asking for accountability of these dollars that are being spent in the classroom should be done i do not know one democrat or one republican who does not look for accountability or efficiency or ask for a balance in their own checkbook we all have a fiduciary duty to the citizens whether they vote or not of this country to be prudent in our fiscal decisions to be prudent in how we spend the taxpayer dollars to be prudent that when we spend those dollars we get the biggest bang for our dollars to be prudent that when wespend those dollars that these kids are getting an education off those dollars there is no question on either side of the aisle no question that education right now is the highest priority in this country and rightfully it should be but do not discount a commitment by a republican education because they stand up and say hey track for me or trace for me where these dollars are going we want the biggest bang let me move on to another subject and tell my colleagues where i am extremely disappointed extremely disappointed in a particular aspect of the arts community in this country i want you to know at the very onset here i am a supporter of the arts i think arts are very important in our community now i know some people some of my good friends disagree with me but i think it is very important and i think there are certain arts programs that the government has an obligation to be involved in but if you want to know what gives a black eye to the arts it is when you use taxpayer dollars to offend the public in such a way you know it is not just an offense it is a horrible offense to them what am i talking about let us lay out the facts right here of the new york city brooklyn museum a museum which has benefactors of great wealth this museum gets government dollars from the city of new york and as i understand it governmeilt dollars from the federal government what do they choose to do with a portion of those dollars they are opening tomorrow a show which has a portrait of the virgin mary with dung and where i come from in the mountain country we call it crap thrown right on the face of the portrait of the virgin mary and they call that art well let me say this to you what they are trying to do right now the prima donnas on that board of directors of that brooklyn museum what they are trying to say to the american people or frame this argument as is an issue of first amendment rights the freedom of speech in this country we believe very firmly in the right for freedom of speech and in the first amendment of our constitution we believe very strongly in that amendment what are they trying to say they are saying that well our opportunity to use taxpayer dollars to pay for a display a portrait of the virgin mary to throw crap on it that is our right to express first amendment rights let me say this is not to be framed as a first amendment argument it is not a first amendment argument those of us who are opposed and obviously i am deeply opposed to what they are doing but those of us who are opposed to this are saying look you have a right to display that kind of art but you do not have a right we have to draw a limitation somewhere you do not have a right to do it with taxpayer dollars nobody is taking away your right of freedom of expression under the first amendment you can go downtown and show that you can carry a picture of it in your wallet you can carry it on the subway you can carry it on horseback out in the mountains if you want to show people nobody is denying that you have the right to do that but you do not have the right to take taxpayer dollars to display a portrait of the virgin mary with crap thrown all over it i wonder what the reaction would be ofthese liberal prima donnas if somebody put up a portrait of martin luther king and threw crap on it they would do something of course it would be horribly offensive would they be standing up today saying well it is the first amendment we in the brooklyn museum ought to display something like that i wonder what these prima donnas would say if with public dollars taxpayer dollars we got a nazi swastika and put it in a park for public display i wonder what these prima donnas would say if somebody got an aids quilt those beautiful quilts made in memory of the people who have died as a result of aids i wonder what they would think if they hung an aids quilt and somebody threw crap on it it is wrong you know it is wrong you should not be using taxpayer dollars for this display so what do they do it is not in them it is not in them to stand up to the american public and say you know we were wrong we made a mistake this portrait of the virgin mary with crap splashed all over it should not be displayed with taxpayer dollars but they do not do it they are not going to do it so what happens we as publicly elected officials and specifically a publicly elected mayor in the city of new york mayor guiliani steps forward and says you are not going to use taxpayer dollars for that kind of display that is offlimits you went across the line he did not say you could not display it anywhere he did not put a ban on the portrait he just said with taxpayer dollars in this taxpaying institution you are not going to display the portrait of the virgin mary with crap splashed all over it so what happens well the liberal community the prima donnas they decide this is where we are going to draw a line in the sand today it is a catholic symbol tomorrow they will go after a jewish symbol where do we draw the limit with taxpayer dollars when do we say enough is enough you have got to use some common sense today i was on a radio talk program it was pretty interesting i had the commentator say to me scotr how can you tell whats offensive or not i said what do you mean how can i tell whats offensive common sense ought to tell you you think a nazi swastika in a public park is offensive the most reasonable man concept and i say that generically obviously your common sense your gut reaction your gut tells you that is offensive we should not have taxpayer dollars doing that that is not a violation of the constitution it is not a violation of the constitution at all we say to tv broadcasters you cannot show certain things on tv that is not a violation of the first amendment it is taxpayer dollars my point that i am making here is that it is important for all of us to understand that it is really pretty easy to decide what is obscene art and what is not what the brooklyn museum could have done and should have done is to call one of their private benefactors many of whom are very wealthy and ask them to put up the private dollars to display this somewhere fund it with private dollars by the way anybody that funds this kind of display is sick in my opinion and do not get me wrong i do not think this is acceptable in any form of the word but constitutionally it is permitted but not with taxpayer dollars this brooklyn museum should have gone to those benefactors and said put up private dollars not the taxpayer dollars private dollars and display it with private dollars what happens all of a sudden the politics get involved hillary clinton first lady steps in she is running for the united states senate well she says this museum ought to be entitled to do this she has taken the side of the museum there is a pretty clear difference right there between what the mayor of new york city is saying no taxpayer dollars and this display is deeply offensive and what the senate candidate over there is saying it is common sense can you imagine our forefathers the generations of the people who fought in wars for us or the catholics in this country and as i said it may be the buddhists next it may be the jews next it may be some other group next can you imagine our fathers and mothers our grandmothers and grandfathers the founding fathers of this country what they would have done if they saw that today under the guise of the constitution we were paying with taxpayer dollars to display a portrait of the virgin mary with crap splashed on it of course you know what your gut reaction tells you that those people would say they would not believe it they would be stunned they could not believe that this great country did not have the restraint with taxpayer dollars to say enough is enough we have certain standards in this country and one of those standards is we are not going to use taxpayer dollars to put a nazi swastika in a park we are not going to use taxpayer dollars to destroy or insult the virgin mary which is a huge christian symbol by throwing crap all over it we are not going to display a portrait of martin luther king and throw crap all over it we are not going to display an aids quilt and throw crap over it we have standards in this country and it is not asking too much to say out there dont do it how does it affect the third district of the state of colorado out where i live out where i represent because of the attitude of these prima donnas on the board of directors of the brooklyn museum in new york city it puts a black eye on the arts clear across this country do you know how many of my constituents are going to say to me scott if were putting an art display in colorado somewhere is it going to be this kind of display is it going to be taxpayer dollars i am begging these people on the board of directors of the brooklyn museum look what you are doing to the art industry across this country in the little communities of colorado or the little communities of utah or up in washington state or down in nevada or in north dakota or in wyoming or kansas or texas do you think this story is isolated in new york city of course it is not isolated in new york city it is all over the country and here we have socalled patrons of the arts standing up and saying we are justified under the constitution to display a portrait of the virgin mary with taxpayer dollars and have crap thrown on it it is wrong you are hurting everybody in the art business in the art profession i know i am going to get a bunch of angry phone calls this evening people opposed i went to law school i have got experience with this the constitution does not protect the right for you to use taxpayer dollars and have that kind of display i hope for the sake of everybody because it is really a losing deal you may get a lot more people to your show brooklyn museum and maybe you are doing this for the money but in the long run it is the arts that suffer it is the very community that you profess to protect it is the very community that you profess to stand up for it is the very community that probably in your heart you feel very deeply about it is that community the art community that you are helping destroy through this kind of action in new york city with your display of the virgin mary with crap thrown all over it you ought to grow up and you ought to get one of your private benefactors and pay for it with private dollars it is a disgrace more than anything else you in your heart know it is a disgrace you in your heart know and mark my word for it the next time either this evening before you go to bed or tomorrow when you wake up and you look in that mirror you look in that mirror and say it is art to do this to a portrait of the virgin mary with the taxpayers dollars let us move on to another subject obviously after the last couple of comments i want to lighten it a little i want to talk about the natural resources kind of the layout of the united states in order to do that i need to give a little description of where i live and the district that i represent i am very proud of my district i think every member in here both democrat and republican obviously are proud of theirdistricts my family has lived in this district they were pioneers in the mid to late 1800s and through all the generations we have been there i will tell you a little story when i went to law school my wife and i wanted our oldest daughter born in colorado i went to law school in texas we felt so strongly about gur heritage in colorado she stayed behind to deliver our baby so that she was born in colorado so we feel strongly about that i will give you an idea of the third congressional district of colorado it is geographically larger than the state of florida looking to my left here is this portrait that is what most of my district looks like it is beautiful mountainous terrain and these mountains you see up here we have in colorado over 56 mountains above 14 000 feet i would guess that this peak right here with the red dot on it is probably above 14 000 feet what is interesting is a lot of these mountains have snow year round in fact i am sure many of you saw and of course we are big bronco fans but i am sure many of you saw last week that in denver it snowed in denver very interesting geographical locations and lots of beauty obviously up in these mountains you can see these trees right here we call those aspen trees they are in my opinion some of the most beautiful trees certainly in my district and probably in the entire world now a lot of this land that we have by the way let me show you the blue sky i am going to do a little promotion here about colorado that blue sky right there in colorado we have over 300 days a year of sunshine 300 days a year of sunshine in the state of colorado my district takes up a little more than half of the state of colorado but one of the things you have got to remember about the west is water that is a pretty boring subject water it is real boring unless all of a sudden it is not coming out of your faucet or it is not there to flush the toilet or they do not have it to serve you in the restaurant water is a critical resource obviously by the way it is the only resource that regenerates itself it is the only natural resource i guess the better way would be to say that it has got automatic renewal it automatically renews itself here are some interesting statistics ninetyseven percent of the water in this country is saltwater of the remaining 3 percent of water in this country 75 percent of that is tied up in the ice caps actually only 05 percent of that water is in our lakes and our river for drinking and consumption by humans when you break that out 73 percent and i know i am throwing a lot of statistics out to you but just kind of picture it as we go along picture the united states a map imagine the united states a map in front of you imagine a line going down between kansas and missouri seventythree percent of the water in this country is east ofthat line about 13 percent actually 12 7 percent around there about 13 percent we will round off 13 percent on our imaginary map right here is up in the pacific northwest and 14 percent is located almost 15 percent is located in what we call the mountainous west that is 14 states those 14 states have onehalf of the continental nations land mass half of the land mass in this country in the continental states is located in 14 states and those 14 states have 14 percent of the water water is a critical resource in the east one of the problems in the east is getting rid of water remember 73 percent of the water lies east of the kansasmissouri line so your problem out in the east if you live in the east in a lot of aspects is how you drain off the water how do you get rid of the water our problem in the west is how do we save the water of those 14 states that i talked about colorado is at the top of those 14 states colorado has been called the mother of rivers colorado has four major rivers which originate out of those mountains and they originate of course as the result of the snowfall so all of that snow that you see throughout those mountain ranges and this of course is a small fraction the red dot on the picture that snow is what provides the water for those four rivers that is why colorado has the title the mother of rivers it has got the colorado river the rio grande river the platte river and the arkansas river as i mentioned earlier in the west we have got to have the capability to store our water you see we do not have heavy rains like in washington d c i never experienced the kind of rains that you have back here i mean when it rains here it rains and rains and rains now we get evening rains in the mountains a lot but we do not have a lot of quantity of rain so what happens because of thatwe are called an arid state we do not get a lot of water we do not accumulate a lot of rain i think in colorado our average water is 16 inches a year so where we focus on the water is the snow in the mountains now how do we get the snow on the mountains converted into the water and how do we get ahold of it well it is a natural process you all know it it happens in the spring it is called spring run off melts the snow down for a period of time now we have problems with spring run off if it gets too warm too early in the spring then the water runs off before we are able to use it for agricultural purposes because we are not quite ready yet if we do not get the snow accumulation then we have a drought year if it stays too cold then the rain although the water comes down it can be too late especially in regards to agriculture so we are very dependent upon the weather out there but once this run off contains that run off goes for about oh 60 to 90 days 60 to 90 days in the spring is when we get the run off from those mountains so for 60 to 90 days we literally have all of the water we could possibly want but after that 90 days what do we have to do with that water we have to store the water now i know that some of my colleagues get kind of a charge out of criticizing dams and water storage in the west i want many of my friends in the east to understand we are different than you are back here as far as water conditions are concerned in the east you have got to get rid of it in the west we have got to preserve it if we did not have dams and by the way the first dam was not in the roosevelt era it was clear back in about 1000 ad in mesa verde it is when the cliff dwellers out in mesa verde which is near cortez near the four corners and the four corners are where four states come together in one spot it is where the cliff dwellers were again a thousand ad the thought is by the historical studies that the reason the cliff dwellers disappeared from the mesa verde dwellings is because they had a drought and their dam did not store enough water that is how serious water is in the west and that is why we have to have dams so before you buy onto some of these people who condemn dams or water storage understand in the west just how critical it is and in colorado we have an interesting situation in colorado one half of the state the western half the part i represent the third congressional district produces 80 percent of the water but 80 percent of the population lives on the other side of the state so you can even see that even at the state level within our own state boundaries water is a very very important subject and there are a lot of things we can talk about but i think some statistics on water and how important water in our life is important for us to look at an acre foot of water a lot of times you hear people talk about an acre foot of water an acre foot of water is about 326 000 gallons of water to be exact 325 900 gallons of water traditionally it has been considered enough water for a family of four people a family of four people for 1 year one acre foot of water is enough for a family of four for 1 year but now that we have brought in some very helpful conservation efforts we have expanded that now i think in todays language one acre foot of water or 325 000 gallons of water is enough really to extend a family of four for 2 years conservation has paid off but we have to use conservation in the right fashion now just talk for a minute about how much water is needed for example for a cow a steer drinks 4 2 gallons of water a day if you are going to have milk the jersey cow that produces the milk needs 12 gallons of water a day for a holstein producing a lot of milk it is 23 gallons of water a day an acre of corn one acre of corn gives off 4000 gallons of water per day just in evaporation so an acre of corn 4000 gallons of water evaporate off that acre a day to grow one bushel of wheat you need 11 000 gallons of water one bushel of wheat can you imagine one bushel of wheat 11 000 gallons of water you need 135 000 gallons of water to grow one ton of alfalfa thank goodness that resource is an automatic renewal these are numbers you probably never heard of before they are numbers that surprise me and i spent half my professional career in water about 1 400 gallons of water are used to produce a meal of a quarterpound hamburger an order of fries and a soft drink so when you go to the store and you get a quarter pounder and order fries and a soft drink to grow that to get everything ready for it took 1 400 gallons of water about 48 000 gallons of water 48 000 gallons of water are necessary to produce the typical american thanksgiving dinner for 8 people so those of you who are going to have thanksgiving dinner at your house and you have got 8 people keep in mind that about 48 000 gallons of water were necessary to produce everything at that dinner table about 1800 gallons of water are needed to produce the cotton in one pair of jeans 1 800 gallons of water for one pair of jeans four hundred gallons just to produce the cotton in a shirt 400 gallons for your shirt takes 39 000 gallons of water to produce the average domestic automobile including tires listen to that"], [0.997776448726654, 0.997776448726654, 0, "i come to the floor again to talk about the subject that is very important to me and to millions of americans unfortunately a subject that does not get a lot of headlines except in local papers and i will refer to those some of those headlines across the country tonight and that is the subject of illegal narcotics and the problem of drug abuse and illegal narcotics trafficking across our great land i come to the floor to report to the house and to the american people again on this epidemic this silent epidemic but deadly epidemic that is facing our nation and a challenge that is facing this congress i inherited from speaker hastert who chaired the national security international affairs oversight subcommittee during the last congress in which i served with him responsibility for national drug policy in the house of representatives working with the speaker and several other colleagues in committees of jurisdiction but my particular subcommittee assignment is chairing criminal justice and drug policy and human resources trying to piece together our national drug policy and whatever efforts this congress may take to stem this horrible problem and each week i come to the floor in a 1hour report to provide sort of an update on what is happening and try to get the message across to the congress that drugs do destroy lives illegal narcotics kill and maim just absolutely devastate family after family in our land in fact last year over 14 000 americans lost their lives to illegal narcotics in our country in the last 6 or 7 years of this administration over 100 000 americans and particularly our young people have been victims and lost their lives more than the losses in many of our recent international conflicts and some of our wars we have suffered these tragic losses and those are losses in lives not to mention the destroyed families the cost to this congress the hundreds of billions of dollars to support our criminal justice system to take care of the social problems the lost employment and other opportunities that are lost with people who fall victim to the plague of illegal narcotics i would be remiss if i did not come to the floor and reflect upon what has been on the minds of the nation since last friday evening when we first learned the news of jfk juniors missing airplane and the whole nation has focused its attention on this great and tragic loss and it is a shame that we have lost this young man i had an opportunity to meet him twice and he provided a beautiful role model handsome young energetic with so much potential and so much life and his life lost and it is sad that a role model coming from a family that has given so much to this nation should be lost in such a tragedy but again across our land every day 50 people die due to illegal narcotics the toll as i said last year is over 14 000 some die silent deaths some more tragic deaths from drug overdoses from direct illegal narcotics use and abuse and tragedies i had the opportunity this morning to see another great role model my son who is 20 and was in washington with me today he and i attended the langley medal award for the apollo 11 astronauts and we had a chance to talk to neil armstrong and to the commander of the module mr collins and also buzz aldrin second man on the moon again great role models for our nation tremendous heroes whose names will go down in history i did have a few minutes to chat with neal armstrong the first man on the moon again a great great role model for our young people he and i in our brief chat did discuss our dismay at trying to find a solution and i salute his efforts now as a private citizen trying to assist us in this war on illegal narcotics in what he has done not only directly but indirectly as serving as a role model of what opportunity this great nation holds for us that those of us who can live a drugfree life without a life of abuse for illegal narcotics or addiction to illegal narcotics but 2 beautiful people 2 beautiful examples of what life can be and hold so much promise and opportunity for each of us i mention both of those tonight as i flew away from washington last week i went through the baltimore airport and picked up the baltimore sun i like to reflect on what is going on around the nation with the problem of illegal narcotics i was struck by last fridays newspaper the baltimore sun on the front page the headline this tragic headline they killed him over 15 sure enough i read on into the paper and let me read from this article a little bit about this preacher who was slain for 15 in a neighborhood in baltimore that has been plagued by so many problems emanating from illegal narcotics let me just read a little bit of this article it says for generations this thin band of forest has embraced the residents of quantico and oswego and clausen avenues in cool green shade but in recent years it became a sherwood of thieves and dope addicts landscaped with syringes liquor bottles and discarded stolen goods further on in the story it relates again how this preacher this good human being a citizen of baltimore was slain for 15 last week it says even the presence of a police athletic league center has not discouraged the interlopers who lounge by the wading pool at night snorting heroin and littering the soccer field with empty drug vials this is baltimore just a few miles from our nations capital what a tragedy of a lost life my message has been that drugs destroy lives and in baltimore indeed drugs have destroyed lives a great example again from the newspaper to bring my colleagues up to date this is an article an associated press article from july 18 just a few days ago in new orleans it says two jefferson parish residents who drove to new orleans to buy heroin were shot and killed early sunday morning in a hail of bullets a companion who survived the attack told new orleans police a wonderful city probably one of the most beautiful cities in america another city ravaged by illegal narcotics and the crime the death that it brings just a few days ago another article another city other lives snuffed out by illegal narcotics this is an article that appeared again within the last 3 days july 17 it says discovering drug labs is part of the job for probacion and parole officers this is not baltimore new orleans or new york or detroit areas where we might expect it it is boise idaho and the ap story reads finding people making the illegal drug methamphetamine is becoming a potentially dangerous fact of life for idaho probation and parole officers the story goes on they increasingly are uncovering makeshift methlooking operations in the course of monitoring and trying to help redirect the lives of exconvicts and offenders getting another chance to avoid prison the story goes on it says the states 170 probation and parole officers have been involved in discovering 51 of the 85 meth labs busted throughout idaho recently this year that is up sharply from 98 found statewide in the entire year of 1998 23 of them found by probation and parole officers people have already been busted once the article goes on to say for using meth and are 2 to 3 times more likely than other offenders to be arrested again 80 percent of the offenders the article goes on to state are battling addiction to meth or other substances right now it is an incredible problem every time we write a violation report the word meth is somewhere in it now this is an article from the heartland of america from idaho we held hearings in our subcommittee and we found evidence of meth production meth epidemics in minnesota iowa idaho atlanta georgia the west coast of the united states places where we would not expect this what was interesting is the source of most of the methamphetamine has been traced to mexico and i would like to just state for the record and show for the record some bad news last week i had some good news that the mexicans were extraditing a murderer from the state of florida and unfortunately this is the news on the people who are producing this meth again across our land jose de jesus amezcua contreras he is actually known as one of the worlds largest producers and traffickers in methamphetamines and is the head of this organization and unfortunately the mexicans who fail to cooperate with us except on very limited occasions took some action that is most regrettable this past week a judge issued an injunction monday against a united states request to extradite amezcua and gave federal prosecutors 10 days to appeal the decision before setting amezcua free despite overwhelming evidence all mexican drug charges have been dismissed against this individual who is helping to import death and destruction whether it is idaho whether it is minnesota iowa or west coast or our southern states again besides the fact that there was overwhelming evidence all the mexican charges have been dropped against him he is still being held in custody fortunately now we have had success again with one individual a unitedstates citizen who committed a horrible murder in southwest florida being judged as eligible for extradition but in fact we have 270 some other requests for extradition including this individual who is the meth king who again is getting off on these charges his brother was released from prison in may the whole family there are a series of these brothers and i have shown their posters here on the house floor before are all involved up to their eye balls in illegal narcotics particularly the deadly meth trade a mexican appellate judge threw out trafficking charges against his brother and now we see the same thing happening here with this individual again with the meth and the story from boise idaho this dateline is birmingham alabama and again it illustrates that illegal narcotics drugs do destroy lives this article is an associated press article within the last few days july 16 it says birmingham alabama pacifiers temporary tattoos and toothpicks seem like harmless enough items but they are also tools of the teenage drug trade according to doctors and drug experts the article goes on and let me just cite part of it drug abuse doubles and even triples in the summer among children graduating from one school to another he said children also report their first drug experience often comes in the summer leading up to the move from elementary to middle sc hool and from middle school to high school because they feel more grown up what is becoming a greater problem is also cited in this birmingham article it says ecstacy is a growing danger it is a relatively new form of amphetamine that can give a euphoric rush in low doses and it often causes strokes heart attacks and breathing problems at higher levels according to this report here again in the heartland of america and our south birmingham alabama ecstacy complements another amphetamine compliments of some of our mexican neighbors to the south coming in in huge quantities here is a story from albuquerque new mexico it says in less than 18 months a drug considered a safe way to help addicts kick heroin habits has been found in the bodies ofmore than three dozen people who died of drug intoxication in new mexico again this year we will probably set a record in excess of 14 000 deaths by illegal narcotics or narcotics taken in this fashion this is a new mexico southwest area albuquerque a beautiful community there were about 200 drugrelated deaths from january 1998 through midmay of this year and 41 of the victims had methadone in their systems according to the department of public safety statistics again illegal narcotics and their effectin one community albuquerque new mexico illegal drugs do destroy lives and have an incredible impact more bad news from mexico this week a mexican appeals judge on friday according to this report cut the 50year prison sentence of raul salinas the brother of mexicos former president by almost half the swiss supreme court overturned the confiscation of about 115 million now how does the former presidents brother get 115 million we know it was drugrelated money we know the family was involved in illegal narcotics up to their eyeballs too like some others we have cited tonight the money that has been held by swiss prosecutors this article says was derived from drug trafficking mr salinas must still serve 27 years for the 1994 assassination of his former brotherinlaw a top ranking official of mexicos ruling institutional revolutionary party here again bad news from mexico one of the families involved in laundering hundred of millions of dollars i have told a story that we had testimony before our subcommittee now this is the former presidents brother raul salinas but we had testimony by a customs agent and i think a fairly reputable source and other sources that confirmed this of one mexican general most recently attempting to place 1 1 billion that is 1 1 billion i did not make a mistake it is not million it is 1 1 billion in illegal drug money into legitimate investments and financial depositories in the united states we know that those meetings took place we know that the general in fact had skimmed that kind of money that is an incredible story of money we see the presidents brother with hundreds of millions and we have mexican generals with billions of dollars to place it should raise many questions about our policy and the lack of action by mexico who wants trade benefits who wants financial assistance of the united states in international monetary markets who wants support to be more than a developing nation to be an equal again trading and financial partner this is the type of cooperation that we get first of all the largest methamphetamine dealer in mexico with the charges dropped next we see the presidents brother the former presidents brother getting his charges reduced and here we also have a case of a mexican general trying to place an incredible amount of money and most of the investigation squashed so it is a pretty sad state of affairs as it relates to mexico now tonight i brought a story of destruction and death from different cities and parts of our country and that is just in the last few days this entire problem of illegal narcotics has an impact on every community in my community in central florida as i have stated before the recent headlines have said illegal narcotics overdoses and deaths now exceed homicides i try to substantiate what we say about illegal narcotics because illegal narcotics are so glorified by hollywood and by movies and videos and commentary among our young people during our recent hearings in our subcommittee we had in experts who testified about what drugs do to the human brain i have a couple of illustrations here the first one and i hope this shows up we talked about ecstacy and how it is making its presence across the nation and also among our young people this is an interesting image it is actually of two different brains this is a brain scan this is a normal brain all of this up here is normal brain action this information again was provided to us by a scientist the top illustration here and brain belongs to an individual who has never used ecstacy and we can see how bright these images are the scans are different scans of the brain from different directions the bottom scans here belong to an individual who has used ecstacy heavily for an extended period but was abstinent from drugs for at least 3 weeks prior to the photographs now one can see the effect that the drug ecstacy has had this is a prolonged effect again of what ecstacy does ecstacy is very popular among our young people and we heard a couple of citations here of areas where it is showing up across our country where we would least expect it it says the specific parameter being measured is the brains ability to bind the chemical neuro transmitter serotonin and that is what this illustration shows serotonin is a substance that is very critical to normal experiences of mood emotion pain and a wide variety of other behaviors but again this shows what damage is done to the brain and to the mind with this illegal narcotic i have another scientific chart here let me just pull off this information card this chart shows what methamphetamine does to the brain this was presented to our subcommittee in a hearing last month it should be very clear evidence not only that drugs destroy lives but also damage the body and the mind this was presented by scientists who completed this study and the photograph demonstrates the long lasting effects that drugs have on the brain the brighter colors in here this shows a normal brain and it shows the substance of dopamine which has a binding capacity dopamine function is critical to emotional regulation and it is involved in the normal experience of pleasure and involved in controlling an individuals motor function the scan on this side the left here is a nondrug user the second scan going down here is a chronic methamphetamine abuser who was drug free for 3 years prior to the takingof the image the third scan this scan right here is a chronic meth abuser who was drug free for 3 years prior to the image now the last brain scan the very last brain scan here is of an individual newly diagnosed with parkinsons disease parkinsons disease is a disease known to deplete dopamine my colleagues can see exactly what is happening to the brain of an individual who uses meth meth is one of the biggest problems and i cited city after city in the heartland ofamerica and now almost in every community this is what methamphetamine does to ones brain this is scientific evidence this is not something we made up in our political deliberations this is scientific evidence both of these presented to our subcommittee and what these illegal narcotics do to the brains of individuals we can talk about treatment and we can talk about trying to help these people but once one has destroyed these brain functions through habitual misuse of methamphetamine or ecstacies or other illegal narcotics this is what we end up it is a very serious situation unfortunately drugs have been glorified ecstacy is now glorified meth is a popular drug both of these drugs are primarily used by our young people we see more and more tragic deaths by our young people and abuse and not only abuse but again the deadly effects and the longterm effects of these illegal narcotics that brings me to the subject of the other drug of plague of the united states and there is no question about that that is heroin heroin deaths as i said in my community are epidemic we have had the police chief of plano texas we have had law enforcement individuals from police chiefs association the national narcotics association all testify about the incredible supply of heroin coming into this country now the heroin that is coming into the country too our testimony has indicated and proven is not of the purity levels of the heroin of the 1970s or the 1980s this stuff is 60 70 percent pure we know exactly where the heroin is coming from and it is a very deadly heroin it is coming from south america as i have said before if we put this chart up in 1993 there would be almost no heroin coming from south america i am going to talk a little bit about the source of heroin and this heroin we know in fact that the heroin is coming from south america because it can be traced scientifically just like the shots i showed my colleagues of the brain scans scientifically we can tell how brains are affected by the chemicals and show exactly what takes place we can test and our dea agents can test heroin and trace it almost to the field that it came from so we know that heroin taken and seizedin the united states we know 75 percent comes from south america again in 1993 the beginning of this administration almost no heroin came from there most of it came from the southwest asia and southeast asia and mexico isnow a doubledigit heroin producer it produced a little bit of black tar heroin now it is producing much more this is where heroin is coming from now again i tell my colleagues who are listening aboutwhat illegal narcotics do from a scientific standpoint from a personal standpoint again i bring out these charts i have only showed these photographs one other time on the house floor but i bring these photographs here again to the floor because there is so much glorification of ecstacy methamphetamine that is so popular and heroin which is on the rampage heroin is now among our teenagers and actually since 1993 listen to these statistics there has been an 875 percent increase in teenage use of heroin that is this incredible supply that is coming in from south america i am holding this up i am holding this up this is one of my constituents from central florida a young man in his twenties and this is how he ended up this is the shot that was taken by the police that the mother allowed for me to bring here and show to the house of representatives the next photograph that i have of him is just a horrible photograph i really hate to show this but i want my colleagues and others to see what illegal narcotics do now this heroin that is coming in this is what it did to the young person if anyone thinks that illegal narcotics are glamorous and that the experience of illegal narcotics is something that should be praised and glorified they should look at the body of this young man i do not like to hold this up for too long but i want my colleagues to know what heroin does to the individual heroin is ingested in the body there is a time usually within 30 seconds where the drug hits the nervous system a warm sensation overcomes the user and there is euphoria and relaxation as a result the user begins to feel the effects on the respiratory system breaking down and the users breathing becomes labored what my colleagues saw in this photograph of this young man from central florida is what took place the respiratory system breaks down and the breathing becomes very slow the corresponding drop in body temperature begins and the heart beat becomes irregular if the user is at this point conscience this is the stage where fear grips the individual soon the body is demanding more oxygen and the users respiratory system cannot accommodate the growing need fluid begins to enter the lungs and this is the beginning ofthe drowning stage sometimes during this phase blood vessels and capillaries begin to rupture my colleagues saw the face of a young man who died a horrible death this is how thousands and thousands of our young people are dying some of them silently some of them we just read in an obituary page this is how this young man died and the photograph as i said was released to me by the mother the photograph taken by the sheriffs department she wanted the house of representatives and the american people to see the inglorious effects of heroin and illegal narcotics on her precious son who she loved so much as evidenced by the photograph that i showed here the blood on the face of the heroin user is the result of blood vessels rupturing entering into the final stage the user is now in great distress and experiences severe pain throughout the thoracic region much like a heart attack the users head is splitting with pain the amount of fluid in the lungs has increased and the user is now in excruciating pain and begins to drown as his or her lungs fill with fluid at this time the user becomes unconscious begins seizures and death is slow but inevitable unfortunately the picture that i showed here tonight is a picture that is repeated dozens and dozens and dozens of times in central florida we have had more than four dozen heroin deaths and most of them by young people in central florida each of these individuals died a death similar to what i described here and they ended up in a human tragedy displayed as i showed in this photograph a horrible end and again leaving behind a loved one this young person that was a son or a daughter loved by parents brothers or other family members i only showed that photograph of this young man with the permission of the mother and the sheriffs department this mother is so courageous and other mothers have banded together in central florida and they have produced a film with our local sheriff in orange county sheriff barry who has done a tremendous job working with the victims families in producing a tape and it shows these photographs and others that are much more graphic than i could show on the floor of the house today about how their young people met their demise through illegal narcotics and particularly heroin so tonight i bring a very clear scientific message about ecstacy about methamphetamines what it does to an individuals brains and about the effect of heroin and the tragedy the heroin again that is out there is not the heroin that was of the low purity levels of a decade ago this is deadly deadly heroin again we know where that heroin is coming from the sad part about all this is that we in fact did not have heroin coming in in this quantity some 6 or 7 years ago almost all of this is a new phenomena and some of it can be very directly related to the policies of the clinton administration unfortunately it is my hope that we can turn that around today i would like to cite a story about where this heroin is coming from most of it is grown in colombia but i would like to cite a story by robert novak a very talented columnist who writes for the washington post and he wrote this in yesterdays column he says as critics feared the peacetime initiative crafted by president pastrana and encouraged by the clinton administration is a disaster now we have to go even further back than this article cites and we will talk about the clinton policy of 1993 when this president took over and how we got to all this heroin being produced in colombia but robert novak cites quite correctly that the current policy backed by the clinton administration is a disaster he goes on to cite and let me quote his story colombia is the first western hemispheric state falling under the control of guerrillas financed by international drug trade but it remains a state department back water while the united states is committed to the balkan ethnic wars colombias priority has always been low that is unfortunately true and i would like to cite some of the history of what has taken place with this administration and it has been one poor policy compounded by another i was elected to the congress and took office in january of 1993 this administration took office and this president in january of 1993 also from the very beginning bad decisions were made by this president and this administration relating to colombia and i would like to cite some of them the very first one and i bring to the floor evidence and this is the committee on which i serve the committee on government reform the ranking minority member at the time the republicans were in the minority in 1994 and i also wrote to the then drug czar lee brown who was president clintons first drug czar we wrote to him saying that the policy was wrong and this is an august 25 letter in response to our request to have a change in united states policy adopted by the clinton administration relating to sharing information with colombia with peru and with bolivia and other countries that involved going after and shooting down in some cases illegal narcotics traffickers a liberal attorney who i understand went from the justice department over into the clinton administrations dod came up with a ruling that we could not share information this was the beginning of a bad policy that led to the production of both heroin and cocaine in colombia in the quantity that we see coming out of there today in 1994 we knew this was the wrong policy we asked the other side to change this in fact at the conference of the americas we met with president clinton and i remember that meeting very well many members challenging his policy that mr lake his adviser i believe was aware of the president said he was not but we ended up changing our law to change the clinton policy that did not allow us to provide this information to go after drug traffickers and here are the letters dating from 1994 on that policy what happened with that policy in fact was that during the bush administration the united states shared realtime intelligence with peru and other countries in an effort to allow them to force down drugcarrying aircraft so that illegal cargoes could be seized this was primarily done through groundbased radars and surveillance systems on may 1 1994 again to cite the history of this the clinton administration stopped this program due to a legal interpretation and again lacking this realtime intelligence the highly effective program was essentially blinded it was the beginning of a bad policy in south america that led to this tremendous change in the production of illegal narcotics and the incredible volume of heroin and cocaine coming from colombia additionally this mistake by the clinton administration was compounded and we researched this just to show again the fact that one mistake was compounded by another in 1996 and the republicans had taken over the house of representatives i might add from 1993 in january through 1995 when lee brown was the director of drug policy our national drug policy there was only one real hearing held and it was less than an hour on our national drug policy and that was only after a request which i circulated and signed by over 130 colleagues for a review of the administrations policy but one hearing on this subject during an entire 2year period as the clinton administration dismantled the war on drugs the further dismantling of the efforts to stop illegal narcotics in south america and in particular in colombia came repeatedly in 1994 and 1995 in 1995 republicans took over the house with the gentleman from new york"], [0.9976170063018799, 0.9976170063018799, 0, "i thank the gentleman for his comments i am going to spend a few minutes talking about social security i was concerned during the presidential campaign that there was a lot of misinformation that went out i am particularly concerned at some of what i would call demagoguing as there were scare tactics frightening seniors that the other candidate might be ruining social security and disrupting its future not only for the kind of benefits they might get but for what kind of consequences might evolve to current workers in this country it seemed appropriate to do a brief review of what social security is how it works what the problems are the insolvency situation and some of the ways that we can keep social security solvent over the long run this first chart shows the future deficits after the year 2015 the little blue in the top lefthand corner shows the increased social security revenue because taxes were increased in the 1993 the 1983 decision and taxes were increased so high that it is bringing in more social security revenues than is needed to pay for current benefits i think it is good to remind ourselves that social security is a payasyougo program workers in america pay their taxes in by the end of the week those taxes are sent out in benefits to current retirees so it is sort of like a ponzi game but the consequences of the future without doing this if we put off this decision if we do not make decisions then we are faced with future deficits that in the words of alan greenspan equal an unfunded liability of 9 trillion that compares to our current budget of 1 8 trillion a year if we were to come up with that 9 trillion it would have to be invested in a savings account having a real return of at least 6 7 percent interest a real return over inflation of 6 7 percent interest to accommodate this red portion the red portion represents how much additional money will be needed in addition to the social security taxes coming in for those particular years i think it is important that we dwell on the fact that payroll taxes have just kept rising over the past in the year 2000 we had a 15 3 payroll tax as we see in 1950 we started around 31 2 percent the consequences of not doing anything are either going to mean a tax increase or benefit cuts or substantial increase in borrowing the leading economists suggest that to borrow that 9 trillion today is going to represent listen to this 120 trillion in tomorrows dollars that we are going to need to come up with in addition to social security tax revenues so let us not put this load on our kids and our grandkids or even on young workers today social security began in 1935 and when franklin delano roosevelt created the social security program over 6 decades ago he wanted it to feature a private sector component to build retirement income social security in all of the literature as i have researched the archives it was to be one leg of a threelegged stool so that you would also have personal savings accounts and private pension plans to go along with the social security benefits it is interesting going into the archives that when these decisions were made in 1935 the senate on two votes voted that an option should be there to allow individuals to have their own private investments that could be invested by them could only be used for retirement like as a substitute for a governmentrun program but in conference committee the decision was made to make it totally a payasyougo government program because of some of the problems we are running into in terms of fewer workers trying to pay their tax in to accommodate more and more retirees social security has been deemed insolvent and there will not be enough money there to keep social security going in the future without some changes unless we do something it is a system that is stretched to its limit 78 million baby boomers begin retiring in 2008 the baby boomers are that gang of youngsters born right after world war ii social security spending exceeds tax revenues starting in 2015 so we run out of this huge tax increase that we put on american workers in 1983 and starting in 2015 we are going to have to come up with more money from someplace and that is the real crux of the problem where do we get that money that is the problem of social security how do you come up with that additional money social security trust funds technically go broke in 2037 but the trust funds are a ledger they are a bunch of ious that says government owes social security this 800 billion that is what the iou amounts to today but the question still is where do we come up with that money once there is less tax revenues coming you have three choices the three choices to come up with that money and it makes no difference whether there is a trust fund or whether this congress simply keeps its commitment to keep social security going number one and the one that is very dangerous in terms of its impact on the economy and workers is yet again we increase taxes on the workers number two we reduce benefits or other government spending number threeis you borrow that 120 trillion from the public so our debt of this country goes up substantially and according to the economist that kind of borrowing would be so disruptive to this economy that it would seriously be a negative impact on the kind of wage that americans earn i think it is important to point out that insolvency is certain it is not some guys with green eye shades out there making rough estimates we know how many americans there are and we know when they are going to retire we know that people will live longer in retirement we know how much they are going to pay in and we know how much they will take out payroll taxes will not cover benefits starting in 2015 and the shortfalls will add up to 120 trillion between 2015 and 2075 i might say barry is helping me barry pump is helping me from the state of iowa the coming social security crisis or payasyougo retirement system will not meet the challenge of the democratic change i talked a little bit about the reduced number of workers this sort of depicts where we are going in terms of the number of workers that are asked to reach into their pockets and pay out their social security tax to accommodate every single retiree back in 1940 we had 38 workers that we could divide the costs up between and among and those 38 workers back in 1940 paid in their taxes to accommodate each one retiree today it is down to three workers within the next 25 years the estimate is that it will be down to two workers paying in their social security tax for every one retiree that means yet again without some modifications to the program we are going to end up substantially increasing taxes or cutting other spending or substantially increasing borrowing and that is why i think it is so important that one aspect of the changes that need to be made is to get a better return on the money that is being sent in by workers and taxpayers today the average retiree gets 1 9 percent back on the money in taxes that they and their employer send in 1 9 percent real return they can get and we can do better than that on a cd account the question then becomes how do you make the transition there is no social security account with your name on it as i have made speeches around the country and in michigan there are a lot of people that think somehow there is an entitlement somehow there is an account with their name on it and itis adding up benefits and there is some kind of investment where they are assured of a return this is a quotation from the office of management and budget the presidents own office of management and budget and i quote them these trust fund balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures but but only in a bookkeeping sense their claims on the treasury that when redeemed will have to be financed by raising taxes borrowing from the public or reducing benefits or other expenditures it is interesting also and i might comment that the supreme court now on two decisions has said that there is no entitlement to social security benefits that the taxes you pay in are not related to in any way to some kind of a guarantee that you will receive benefits taxes are simply a tax that the united states congress and the president have decided to tax workers benefits are simply a benefit for retirees that congress and the president have decided to give senior citizens there is another misconception that economic growth is somehow going to help social security not so social security benefits are indexed to wage growth wage growth goes up faster than inflation so benefits for retirees are going up faster than inflation i have introduced three social security bills now that have been scored by the social security administration to keep social security solvent i was named chairman of a bipartisan task force on social security and so for the last 3 years we have been looking into and studying what needs to be done with social security what are the problems what are the consequences and how do we correct it in my bill one way to slow down the increase for higher income retirees is do away with wage inflation and change it to simple inflation based on economic inflation when the economy grows workers pay more in taxes but will also earn more in benefits when they retire because what you pay in taxes what your earnings are directly related to what you are going to get in benefits you add to that wage inflation instead of traditional inflation and we see benefits going up more than what is going to be paid in in the short run simply because of more people having a job and more people having higher incomes so in the long run a stronger economy does not solve the social security problem you end up with a hole later on and that is what this says growth makes the numbers look better now but leaves a larger hole to fill later the administration has used these shortterm advantages an excuse to do nothing obviously everybody that has looked at this last campaign between governor bush and vice president gore understands that there was a huge scare factor with seniors that seniors can be frightened and the reason is because a large number of those seniors depend on social security for most of their income when anybody starts talking about any changes they do get nervous i just hope that the demagoguing in this campaign has not done away or dramatically reduced the chance of this congress next year and the president next year whoever it is to move ahead with social security reform because the longer we put it off the more drastic the solutions the longer we put this off the more drastic solutions let me just tell you the first bill i introduced when i came to congress in 1993 was with very modest changes to make sure that we started getting some better return on the tax money sent in of course you remember the chart of current surpluses we have had all of these surpluses those surpluses have been squandered for the last 40 years because this body and the past presidents have decided to use the extra money cominginfrom social security tospend on other programs we have stopped that by the way it isa little gimmicky but the republicans came up with this idea that they called a social security lockbox it was good because the public liked the idea of us stopping spending the extra tax money coming in from social security now until we find a way to best use that money to keep social security solvent it is being used to pay down that part of the debt held by the public and so the total debt of this country is not going down what we are doing is using the social security surplus sort of like using one credit card to pay off another credit card we are using the social security surplus to pay down that part of the federal debt held by the public it should be made very clear because there were a lot of comments on this during this recent election by a lot of people that led the american people to believe that we were paying down the debt of the united states congress the total debt subject to the debt limit is not going down because of the fact that we are using the surplus from social security and the other trust funds to pay down the debt held by the public public debt versus the social security shortfall vice president gore suggested that we pay down the debt held by the public the total debt held by the public is a little over 5 6 trillion that part that is held by wall street what treasury bills treasury bonds the debt held by the public is 3 4 trillion the vice president suggested if we pay down this debt we can use the savings on interest to accommodate the demands of social security over the next 54 years this is the amount of money that is going to be the shortfall over the next 54 years in social security 46 6 trillion and so to pay down this debt of 3 4 trillion the accommodation of that 260billion that we save in interest every year is not going to accommodate that kind of shortfall let us do it it is a good start let us get the public debt paid down let us start paying down the total debt of this country this is another way to depict what was just talked about over the next 10 years there is going to be 7 8 trillion coming into social security 5 4 trillion are going to be used up in paying benefits and that leaves a surplus of 2 4 trillion and sowhat governor bush has suggested what i am suggesting is that we take some of this surplus to start the personal retirement savings account i would stress these are the kinds of accounts that are limited you can only invest the money in certain safe investments and you can only use it for retirement it is not like it has been suggested that everybody is going to have the chance to be if you will convinced by the snake oil salesman from someplace to invest their money because it has high returns your investments are going to be limited such as the thrift savings account for the federal government employees to some extent like the 401 k s that a lot of our citizens have but again now is the time that we need to start a transition to get a real return i am sure we can work with democrats and republicans if the decision is made not to demagogue this in the next election which brings me down to my conclusion that the best time the most opportune time to solve social security is going to be next year the first year of a 4year presidential incumbency and the first year of a 2year term for every member of this particular house as you see on this chart we end up with a savings if we were to pay down the debt held by the public we end up with a savings of 260 billion a year if we keep that 260 billion and instead of using it to pay interest on the debt held by the public we apply it to social security this bottom blue represents how much of the total social security benefits will be accommodated by that interest savings you still end up with a shortfall of 35 trillion the biggest risk i am convinced is doing nothing at all social security has a total funded liability of over 9 trillion that i mentioned that 9 trillion of unfunded liability today can be expressed in terms of 120 trillion in tomorrows dollars in the next 75 years dollars that is going to bethat amount is going to be short of what is needed to pay benefits over and above what comes in in social security taxes the social security trust funds contain nothing but ious to keep paying promised social security benefits the payroll tax will have to be increased by nearly 50 percent or benefits will have to be cut by 30 percent neither of those options is acceptable certainly a tax increase should not be acceptable but let me briefly review what we have done on increasing the social security taxes over the last 60 years in 1940 the social security tax was 2 percent 1 percent for the employee 1 percent for the employer it was on the first 3 000 of income maximum tax employee and employer combined was 60 in 1960 we increased the tax to 6 percent increased the base to 4 800 again 288 a year was the total of employeeemployer taxes on social security 1980 it went up to 10 16 percent on 25 900 today after the 1993 changes it has now developed into a 12 4 percent tax on the first 76 200 of payroll what do we do that brings it to almost 9 500 per year if we let this go then we are asking so much of young workers of our kids and our grandkids to pay this exceptional tax i am a farmer from michigan i grew up with the idea that one tries to pay off the farm mortgage to leave ones kids a little better chance but this body this body and this congress gets so i think wrapped up in the importance of spending today that we think taking money from them and leaving them an extra high mortgage justifies the kind of standard of living that we want and the kind of things that this body and the body down at the other end of the capitol the senate and the president want to spend money on that is what we are arguing about now on finishing off this years budget can we reduce the increase in spending personal retirement accounts let me talk about what would one do if one had some individual investments what is compound interest compound interest means that if one can invest ones money one gets extra interest on it it makes that fund larger then the interest on that extra amount of money that can grow it can make an average worker a rich retiree if john doe makes an average of 36 000 a year and they are allowed to invest 4 percent of their social security tax in a private account then instead of getting the 1 280 a year from social security they would be receiving 6 514 a month from that kind of a personal retirement account when they passed the social security law in 1934 they said it is an option whether counties and states want to opt into the social security system or have their own retirement program galveston county texas opted to have their own personal investment let just take a look at what is happening there death benefits under social security 253 in galveston 75 000 disability benefits 1 280 under social security the galveston plan 2 749 the retirement benefits social security 1 280 same as disability the galveston plan for retirement is 4 790 a month private investments and the magic of compound interest have to be part of what is going to keep this system solvent personal retirement accounts they do not come out of social security they become part of ones social security retirement benefits a worker will own his or her retirement account it is limited to safe investments it certainly can earn more than the 1 9 percent interest that an average retiree today is getting from social security that is going to be much lower in the future san diego is another area that has opted out of social security into a personal retirement account system a 30yearold employee there who earns a salary of 30 000 for 35 years and contributes 6 percent into his pra would receive 3 000 per month in retirement and under the current system he would contribute twice as much but receive only 1 077 from social security let me conclude by quickly running through these and making a comment the unitedstates trails other countries in saving its retirement system other socialized countries are moving into the private personal retirement accounts faster than the united states i represented the united states at a worldwide meeting on social security over in london 3 years ago i was so surprised to see so many of the other countries that were so far ahead of us in getting such a much larger return and having success in keeping their public retirement pension solvent in the 18 years since chile offered the pras 95 percent of chilean workers have received accounts their average rate of return has been 11 3 percent per year other countries australia britain switzerland all offer workers their own personal retirement accounts the british workers chose pras overwhelmingly for their top tier so even from england the socialized country they moved into their own personal retirement accounts there are several ways we can do this some of the democrats have expressed concern that the stock market is too risky but one can decide what the balance is whether it is 30 or 40 percent into bonds and 60 or 70 percent into equities one can limit the equities to indexed stocks indexed global funds an index that is going to be across the board over the years the average for any 30year period if one starts working at age 20 and finished working at age 50 for a 30year period for the last 100 years the average return on equity investments is 6 7 percent this is just sort of repeating myself a little bit but based on a family income of 58 400 some the return on a pra is even better if one invests 2 percent as the blue if one invests 6 percent as the pink and the purple is if one had invested 10 percent of ones income but over 30 years one would end up with almost 1 million but over 40 years it would be 1 000 389 if one worked for 40 years paying in 10 percent being allowed to take 10 percent into ones private investments if i have one final message certainly it would be that everybody has to make a greater effort savings and investing that social security cannot be ones total retirement account in our social security tax force we had testimony that within the next 25 years people would have the option of living to be 100 years old if they wanted to that not only offers a tremendous challenge to government run programs and their future solvency but it emphasizes the need to move out of a fixed benefit program at least partially at least to some extent and have a fixed contribution but it also says that every individual today needs to make a more aggressive effort to save and invest that is why this chamber has decided to encourage savings and investment"],

speak for the remainder of this evening about managed care reform one of these days we are going to pass this and my friend from new jersey and i will maybe have to stop passing like ships in the middle of the night coming to the floor to speak about this issue but it has become i think commonplace knowledge that we have problems with managed care in this country that is recognized by a lot of the humor that we see in the country several years ago a joke started going around the country about the three doctors who died and went to heaven the first doctor was a neurosurgeon st peter asked him what did you do for a living he said i took care of victims of automobile crashes who had injured their heads and tried to get them back to a normal life st peter said enter my son and enjoy heaven the next doctor who came up to the pearly gates was asked by st peter what he did he said i was a heart surgeon and i took care of people who were having heart attacks and managed to prolong their lives so that they could spend them with their families st peter said enter my daughter and enjoy heaven the third doctor who came up to the pearly gates was asked by st peter what did you do he said well i was an hmo manager st peter kind of stroked his beard and he said son you may enter but only for 3 days now everyone has heard that joke why is that funny well number one because there is a kernel of truth in it and there is a twist all of us who have had to deal with managed care and as a physician i certainly have in advocating for my patients knows that managed care has put severe time limits on whether patients can stay in the hospital we will talk about some of those examples so now it is sort of funny that this hmo manager is going to get his comeuppance i think that is part of the humor the humor of hmos in order for something to be humorous people have to understand the underlying point so let us just look for example at some of the cartoons that we have seen around the country here is one we see a doctor sitting at a desk he is reading a paper behind him is an eye chart that says enough is enough and the doctor is saying your best option is cremation 359 fully covered the patient sort of nonplussed is sitting there saying this is one of those hmo gag rules isnt it doctor now this is a little harder to see for my colleagues here in the audience tonight i will have to read this to you here is a physician sitting behind his desk he is talking to a patient the physician is saying i will have to check my contract before i answer that question now what is the point of this cartoon well about 3 years ago it became known that hmos were writing contracts that required the doctor to check with the hmo before they told the patient all their treatment options now think about that let us say that one is a woman one has a lump in ones breast one goes in to see ones doctor ones doctor takes ones history does ones physical exam and then says ahhah excuse me and steps outside gets on the phone to the hmo and says mrs soandso has a lump in her breast she has got three treatment options one is more expensive than the other is it okay if i tell her what her three options are i mean that is awful as a practicing physician in solo practice for 10 years after medical school and residency i can tell my colleagues that the doctorpatient relationship will not stand that type of restriction on communication patients have to trust their physician to be able to tell them thewhole story it may be that the hmo is not going to cover part of the treatment or one of the options but the patient has every right to know what all the options are at a minimum then we start to get into some things that are a little less than funny on an issue like this here is a headline from the new york post what his parents did not know about hmos may have killed this baby now here is an infant that died possibly because his hmo prevented his physician from communicating to his parents the entire story it is not so funny anymore let us go to the case of a lady whose story was covered in time magazine a couple years ago well documented this lady is no longer alive her hmo made a medical decision to try to limit her and her family her husband from knowing all of her treatment options they put a lot of pressure on the medical center to prevent and actually change their opinion on what kind of treatment this patient should have this lady could be alive today as a mother to her children and a wife to her husband had not that hmo made a medical decision that limited the information that she got not so funny anymore so what happened well i and the gentleman from massachusetts in a bipartisan fashion reached across the aisle and we got about 285 cosponsors to sign a bill called the patient right to know act this was about 3 years ago now 285 bipartisan cosponsors we discussed some suspension bills here tonight just with the cosponsors alone we could have brought that to the floor and passed it under suspension not to be i could not get my leadership to allow that limited bill with such widespread bipartisan support to handle the problem that hmos were limiting communications between the doctors and their patients i could not get the leadership to allow that to be voted on and debated on the floor well let us go back to some of the humor that has gone on about hmos remember the movie as good as it gets i went with my wife to this movie in des moines iowa and something happened i had never seen before when helen hunt was describing the care that her hmo gave in the movie to her asthmatic son she expressed a rather strong expletive about her hmo and the treatment she was getting for her son it elicited a lot of laughs in the audience but something else happened that i had never seen in a comedy in a movie theater some people stood up and clapped they actually started clapping for her strong statement of disapproval about the way her son was being treated now that does not happen humor like that is not effective if it is not understood and if it doesnt strike a nerve and a cord but it sure didin that movie now she was having problems with her son getting care and was frequently having to take him to emergency rooms here is another cartoon sort of that i saw here is a nurse on the phone i think this is from an old tv show this picture she is saying chest pains well let me find the emergency room preapproval forms what is one of the other problems that we have seen with hmos well it happens to be that a lot of hmos a few have refused to pay for emergency room visits let us say a patient gets a chest pain severe crushing chest pain the american heart association says this is a sign one could be having a heart attack ones wife takes one to the emergency room they do the ekg but it is normal they find out that instead one has severe inflammation of ones esophagus and ones stomach instead afterwards what does the hmo do they say see your ekg was normal you were not having a heart attack you did not need to go to the emergency room we are not going to pay for it what is the lessen that people start learning from that gee maybe if the hmo is not going to cover these things that the common layperson would say is an emergency maybe i should just take my time a little bit except that we know when that happens a certain number of people die before they get to the hospital now there certainly is such a thing as black humor and this cartoon has some of the blackest humor i have seen what we have here is a medical reviewer at an hmo and i am going to read this for my colleagues she is speaking on the telephone she says cuddly care hmo my name is bambi how may i help you she continues speaking on the phone oh you are at the emergency room and your husband needs approval for treatment he is gasping writhing eyes rolled back in his head it does not sound all that serious to me she says far side she says clutching his throat turning purple uhhuh have you tried an inhaler oh he is dead well then he certainly does not need treatment does he her last comment is people are always trying to rip us off pretty black humor but let us talk about a real case let us talk about this young woman who about a year and a half ago was hiking in the appalachian mountains she fell off a 40foot cliff she was lying at the bottom of that cliff with a broken skull a broken arm a broken pelvis semicomatose almost drowning in a pool of water fortunately her boyfriend was able to get an air ambulance in they took her to the hospital here she is all bundled up on the stretcher going to airlift her to the hospital she makes it to the hospital emergency room she is stabilized she is treated she is in the hospital for a month or so in the icu for a couple of weeks she is on a morphine drip those are pretty painful problems that she had plus she has broken her head she has got a fractured skull what happens to this young woman her limo refuses to pay the bill now why is that well the hmo said that she did not call ahead for prior authorization i mean think of that she was supposed to know that she was going to fall off this cliff maybe when she is lying at the bottom of the cliff with the broken skull a broken arm and a broken pelvis she is supposed to reach into her coat pocket with her nonbroken arm pull out a cellular phone dial a 1800 number and say bambi at that hmo i have a broken skull i need to go to the emergency room is that okay i mean that is the type of thing that we do not need to see that we need to fix and we need to fix it because congress passed a law about 25 years ago called erisa and what it did for employer plans was it took them out of state oversight state insurance commissioners and state legislatures they do not have much to say about plans that are offered by employers we talk a lot as republicans about devolving power back to the states but i have not seen my leadership too much interested in making sure that the states can provide proper oversight for health plans and so we have this law that congress created that basically left a vacuum state insurance commissioners cannot tell a plan like that woman who fell off the cliff they cannot tell her plan if she is in an employer plan that they have to cover her services those plans have been exempted from state oversight congress made that problem congress needs to fix it let us look at a few other cartoons that have been in the press here is one called the hmo bedside manner and we have an individual lying there with broken arms in traction and on the wall is the hmo bedside manner and it says time is money bed space is loss turnover is profit and then we have a physician at the bedside saying after consulting my colleagues in accounting we have concluded youre well enough now go home or how about this one remember the good old days when we took refresher courses in medical procedures this doctor is saying to a colleague now they are going into the hmo medical school and the course directory for the hmo medical school is first floor basic bookkeeping and accounting second floor advanced bookkeeping and accounting third floor graduate bookkeeping and accounting now here we have another example of the hmo emphasis on bottom line profits versus taking care of the patient this is the hmo claims department and we have a claims reviewer saying into her telephone no we dont authorize that specialist then she goes on no we dont cover that operation then she says no we dont pay for that medication then apparently the person on the other end of the line says something where she kind of jerks and she says no we dont consider this assisted suicide how about this cartoon that appeared in the boston globe we have an hmo doctor here and the patient is saying do you i ke more money if you give patients lass care the hmo employee says thats absurd crazy delusiona the patient comes back and says are you saying im paranoid the hmo employee says yes but we can treat it in three visits now my colleagues may think that this is kind of funny but as a plastic and reconstructive surgeon i took care of a lot of patients with this type of defect this is a little child born with a cleft lip and a cleft palate now the standard treatment for correction of this childs cleft palate is a surgical repair that gets the roof of the mouth together so that this child can learn to speak normally it also keeps food and liquids from going out his nose that is standard treatment do my colleagues know what some hmos are doing now they are writing into their contract language a definition of medical necessity that says we will only authorize payment for the cheapest least expensive care under federal law they can do that and nobody can challenge it because that is written into their contract so what does that mean for a little baby that is born with this type of defect it means that that hmo under federal law could tell the parents that they are not going to cover surgery that they are just going to provide their child with a little piece of plastic to kind of shove up into the roof of his mouth that will kind of fill in that hole of course if baby spits it out that does not matter if baby chokes on it i guess that could be a problem and of course the baby will not be able to learn to speak normally and eventually will continue to have problems with food coming out of his nose but under current federal law the current employee retirement income security act law that imo can write that medical definition any way they want not exactly the best way to take care of patients and one of the reasons why we need to do something to fix that now i just read this this is from the albany times union here is another emergency room story and this is about a lady by the name of elsa goldstein she had a medical emergency one night she went to the hospital emergency room she was given a medication in the hospital by the emergency room doctor she was supposed to take the medicine twice a day so she went to the local pharmacy where she has coverage through her hmo but the pharmacy would not provide her the medicine they wanted to charge her 109 for the medication so she said why is that i mean my insurance company is supposed to pay for this is it not and she was told yes but only if the hmo doctor writes the prescription she said well wait a minute i was in the emergency room this was an emergency room doctor who wrote me the prescription my hmo doctors office is closed it is in the middle of the night and i need that medication the response was sorry you cannot have it you can pay for it yourself and then she got on the phone with an imo representative who said oh just take this medication this overthecounter medication funny thing about this though this elsa goldstein happened to be a physician herself and the medication that this hmo bureaucrat was prescribing over the telephone she knew would have been detrimental to her health this is the type of stuff that goes on all of the time here is another one of these costcutting mechanisms what did that hmo try to do they tried to just dun this patient if they do it enough enough people will just give in they will just buy it on their own and then the hmo just makes more money now what did the hmos come up with as a great idea a few years ago remember this remember when they were saying oh people can just go to the hospital and go home right away in fact we are going to mandate those sort of drivethrough deliveries so here we have a picture of the maternity hospital and we have here the drivethrough window now only 6minute stays for new moms congratulations would you like fries with that and you have this as far as the woman in the car holding her newborn baby ready to drive through and drive out by the way this was the result of one of those milleman and robertson guidelines that the hmos like to use that they like to flaunt as their solutions how about dr welby now maybe he would be saying she had her baby 45 minutes ago discharge her once again we are getting into a little bit more black humor because here we have the operating room we have the doctors here and the doctor is saying scalpel and the hmo bean counter says pocket knife and then the doctor says suture and the hmo bean counter says bandaid and the doctor says let us get him into intensive care and the hmo bentonite says call a cab but here is a real story front page headlines new york post hmos cruel rules leave her dying for the doc she needs all of a sudden it is not so funny anymore because now we have a picture of a person who has probably lost her life because of an hmo medical decision which by the way under federal law an employer plan is not liable for the consequences of their medical decisions other than providing the cost of care not delivered and if the patient happens to die early then they are not responsible for anything well mr speaker it is getting kind of late so i want to talk about two more patients i want to talk about a conversation i had about a year ago with a pediatrician who worked in the washington d c area she is now doing research at one of the national labs i asked her why she left the practice of medicine she was a pediatric specialist in a pediatric icu and she said well i just got past the point of being able to deal with those hmos anymore but the straw that really broke my back was one day we had come into the intensive care unit a 5 or 6yearold boy who had been drowning he was still alive but just barely we had him hooked up to the ventilator we had him plugged into the iv we were giving him all the medicine that we could to try to save his life we were standing around the bedside it was not looking good but we were expending every effort to try to save this childs life and the phone rings in the icu and it is some hmo reviewer a thousand miles away wanting to know about the case probably looking at a computer screen and an algorithm and the questioning went sort of like this well tell me about this young patient oh he is on the ventilator well what is his prognosis the doctor says well it is not too good we are trying to do everything to save his life he has only been here an hour or so this hmo reviewer from a thousand miles away never having seen this patient then says this incredible thing probably looking at that computer screen on the ventilator poor prognosis next suggestion from the hmo one of these hmo guidelines well if his prognosis is so bad why do you not just send him home on a home ventilator now for anyone who has any medical experience on this that would make the hair on the back of their head stand up if that little child is going to survive he is going to need every ounce of expertise and skill from a whole team of nurses and doctors and for this medical reviewer to say send him home on a home ventilator is a death sentence what is the motivation behind it to save a few bucks i am going to close with one story this is a story about this little boy right here you see him tugging at his sisters sleeve when he was about 2 months old about 3 in the morning he was pretty sick he had a temperature of 104 and as mothers can tell he needed to go to the emergency room so his parents lived south of atlanta georgia his mother does the thing that the hmo says phones the 1800 number gets a distant voice from somebody who has never seen this little boy he says well i will let you go to an emergency room but i am only going to let you go to this one emergency room which is more than 65 miles away that is all i will authorize that is the only one we have a contract with to save money so mom and dad they are not health professionals they wrap up little jimmy in a blanket they get in the car dad starts driving they are halfway there and they pass three other hospital emergency rooms they could have stopped jimmy at but they do not have authorization they are not health care professionals but they do know if they stop unauthorized they will be stuck with potentially a very large bill so they follow the medical decision that that hmo reviewer made and push on except that before they get to the hospital that jimmy is supposed to go to he has a cardiac arrest his eyes roll back in his head he stops breathing his heart stops and his mom tries to keep him alive they pull into the emergency room mom leaps out of the car with this little baby screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse comes out gives him mouthtomouth resuscitation they bring the crash cart out they start the ivs they give him the medicine and they manage to get him going again they manage to save his life unfortunately they do not manage to save everything on jimmy because of that cardiac arrest from that decision that that hmo made jimmy ends up with gangrene of both hands and both feet and the doctors have to am putate both hands and both feet here is a picture of little jimmy today in order to save as much length on his arms and his legs they put skin grafts on after they amputated his hands and his feet i talked to his mom about a month ago jimmy is now learning to put on his biliteral leg prosthesis but he still needs a lot of help on getting on his bilateral hook prosthesis this little boy will never play basketball i will tell the speaker of the house that that little boy will never wrestle when this littleboy grows up and marries the woman that he loves he will never be able to caress her cheek with his hand do my colleagues know what the opponents of this patient protection legislation say they say this is just an anecdote we should not legislate on the basis of anecdotes i would say to them this little anecdote if he had a finger and you pricked it it would bleed and do my colleagues know that under federal law that hmo which made that medical decision is liable for nothing is that justice is that fair we need to change that law to encourage hmos not to cut corners like this so that we do not end up having to cut off hands and feet a judge reviewed this case and the hmos decision and came to the determination that that hmos margin of safety was razor thin i would add to that as razor thin as the scalpel that had to amputate little jimmys hands and feet my colleagues as my colleague from new jersey pointed out for years now we have been trying to get this to the floor for a fair debate we had a rigged debate last year with a fig leaf bill i am telling my friends on both sides of the aisle that there are republicans and there are democrats that have come together and we are working on a bipartisan bill we will introduce that soon and we will do everything we can with more than a majority of the members of this house to bring this to the floor and to correct these types of abuses i would encourage my friends on the republican side of the aisle to contact myself or the gentleman from georgia"]], "top_unsure": [[0.10928678512573242, 0.6092867851257324, 0, "and messrs younc of
