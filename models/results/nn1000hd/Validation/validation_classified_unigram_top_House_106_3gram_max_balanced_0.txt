it right is it fair under our tax code a married working couple where both the husband and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because it is the right thing to do so again i urge a yes

vote occursand it will happen again we fully intend it to happen again fortunately we will have a vice president to break that tie the patients bill of rights issue is very important let me mention a couple of other issues and then i will conclude we also have a responsibility to deal with the farm crisis and we have not done so very well we have a farm bill that doesnt work the freedom to farm bill does not work it has been a failure since it was enacted in 1996 the promise was produce what you want we will sell it overseas and get rid of the farm program and things will be better off since that time prices have collapsed and family farmers have had an awful time trying to make ends meet in most cases they are receiving far less now in real terms than they received during the great depression for their product these are not people who are slothful these are not people who arent being productive they are economic allstars they produce in prodigious quantity the food the world needs so desperately yet the market says by the way your food has no value while people climb trees to pick leaves to eat in countries around the world where there is not enough food family farmers driving a 2ton truck to a country elevator are told by the grain trader your food has no value something is wrong with that what really has no value is the current farm program it doesnt work it is long past time to fix it we are within three or four votes of doing that i encourage help from the other side to give us the votes needed to pass a farm program that provides real assistance for family farmers while we are on the subject of freedom those who wrote the freedom to farm billi didnt and i voted against itshould understand there is something called the freedom to sell the freedom to sell means if you want to give family farmers the freedom to produce whatever lets also give them the freedom to sell their products in markets such as iran iraq cuba north korea and others that have been off limits to them because this country has imposed economic sanctions against countries whose behavior we dont like i am fine with economic sanctions slap them with sanctions but dont ever include food as a part of those sanctions using food as a weapon is unbecoming to this country a country as big and as good and as powerful and as important as this country ought never use food as a weapon the freedom to sell is a pretty important principle whichwe ought to care a bit about there is an amendment that i put in the appropriations bill now in conference and i know there are a couple of house leaders who are intending to try to kill that as we get to conference i am hoping with the bipartisan support we received in the senate that we wfll prevail on this issue finally one of the other important issues we face as we wrap up this congress is trying to do something to strengthen the education system in our country we have the opportunity to do that it is just that we have all of this bickering back and forth we have things that we know need to be done everybody here understands that if you are in a classroom of 15 people there is more learning going on than if there is a classroom with 1 teacher and 30 kids class size matters we have proposals to reduce class size which will dramatically improve education we also understand you cannot learn in schools that are in functional disrepair no wonder there is disrepair in the schools they were built 50 or 60 years ago after world war ii when we had soldiers coming back having families and building schools for their children all across the country many of these schools are still in use today and are in desperate need of repair and remodeling if anyone doubts that take a trip to the ojibwa school on the turtle mountain indian reservation or the cannon ball elementary school south of bismarck nd take a look at those schools and ask yourself whether those schools need help the third grader who walks through the classroom door in the cannon ball school ought to be able to expect the same opportunity for a good education as all kids in this country yet these children dont have the same opportunity we know that yet legislation to improve and modernize our schools languish in this senate because some people dont believe it is important or some people believe they cannot do it because if they did somebody

are safe and secure in a world that is full of despots and danger and time and again we have had to resort to blood and iron when words and good intentions failed us among other things this bill provides for better pay and better benefits for our men and women in uniform and it allocates crucial money for our shortfalls in operations training and infrastructure maintenance finally it will increase the pace at which our rapidly aging equipment is modernized or replaced this is an important issue and this is an important bill i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support our national defense to support our troops and to support this bill i urge them to vote against the motion to recommit so that we may move forward"], [0.0004698634147644043, 0.5004698634147644, 1, "i

would isolate the united states from the international economy i oppose the resolution in todays internetbased lightningfast economy it is critical for the unitedstates to have the ability to resolve trade crisis through a binding rulesbased international system while there is room for improvement the wto and its dispute resolution mechanism have served the united states workers farmers and businesses well throughout the existence of the wto the unitedstates has succeeded in winning 25 out of the 27 cases that we have initiated in the dispute resolution system the clintongore years have been prosperous for our country one of the best ways to continue this success is by pursuing international markets the wtos rulebased approach to settling disputes will limit costly inefficient trade retaliations and international strife but in todays informationbased economy it is critical that the unitedstates be able to preserve our place as the worlds technology leader by protecting our intellectual property while i think the wto has moved trade policy many steps forward there are reforms that i would like to see the wto should increase the transparency of its operations and take into account the impact of its actions on workers and the environment it should disclose more information preferably on line were the wtos operations more open to the public i believe many of it

issue of foster care children aging out of the child welfare system arose in both the civil and criminal arena i would like to thank the gentlewoman from connecticut and the gentleman from maryland mr cardin for asking me to come to the floor to speak on this issue mrs jackie ashby a constituent from my district wrote the following letter which best expressed the need for change she originally wrote in support of h r 671 however her comments are just as applicable to 102 miss ashby is a social worker in my district she writes dear representative tubbsjones it has come to my attention that the house resolution is being debated concerning abused and neglected children who are aging out of foster care i would strongly urge you to support this bill i work in an independent living program in cleveland the children i work with are 18 years old and are exactly the children for whom this resolution is aimed i know from firsthand experience that these kids need your help ten years ago i kept watching children leave our residential center or even our group home to the street because they had nowhere else to turn once they turned 18 they were too old for the child welfare system to take care of them anymore and they were unprepared to manage job school bills relationships drugs sex and all the other things that go with adult life they ended up back with the same parents who abused or neglected them or in relationships that mirrored those poor parental relationships often this resulted in them becoming homeless abusing drugs or becoming either victims or perpetrators of crime there were many good programs out there and my agency gave me the freedom to look at these programs and find a model that worked for these kids and start it five years ago three staff and myself began the independent living program we had our share of troubles the scenarios above still happen for some kids but i can tell you more kids now graduate from high school more kids than before learn what it takes to be a good worker and how to keep a job and more kids know that they can never go home at least not to stay again and they do have other choices the sad thing is that sometimes all those revelations happen after they have been kicked out of the childrens welfare system being homeless jobless or overcome by drug abuse are powerful lessons that many kids could be helped with when they ask for it but the system doesnt allow for reentry into the childrens system once they are 18 the adult system here in cleveland although better than most doesnt cater to the specific problems of young adults consequently young people who are belligerent present poorly and are reluctant to follow through without a good deal of followup by the case manager wont get services let me give you an example linda spent her whole life in foster care from foster care home to foster care home even a failed adoption all she wanted was to be able to live with her mother for whom she knew was parenting her other three siblings reunification was tried and failed one home after another couldnt tolerate her belligerent attitude skipping school and her sexual acting out out of frustration certainly not because she was mature enough the child protection worker recommended an independent living program linda loves the idea finally she has a home of her own and for the first month of the program she does wonderfully she is compliant eager to learn and has made a nice connection with the staff school starts to fall apart she was behind in school so now she starts cutting classes she has allnight parties with all her friends in her apartment and now her counselor thinks she is using marijuana the program tries intervention after intervention linda states she wants out out of the system and out on her own her wish gets granted mostly because there are so few services to offer an adult who is unwilling to comply with basic rules so linda goes back with mom which is where she always wanted to be but lindas fantasy of having mom waiting at the door with open arms is quickly dashed by the reality of a mom who now has other children to attend linda and mom never worked out the problems of the past so the past repeats itself and linda at some point either leaves moms house or gets kicked out linda now ends up either going from friends house to friends house if she is lucky to have friends or on the street now linda is calling the program back saying gee i learned my lesson you were all right all along take me back ill be better and the social worker says sorry we would love to have you back i really believe you have learned your lesson but youre not a kid any more youre an ablebodied adult and you should get yourself a job and make a life for yourself after reading this you might say tough love is the best medicine and for some a good dose is but how many 18 years old do you know who have had sometimes 20 caregivers over the course of their young life and who have to decide where they are going to live how they are going to support themselves what theyre going to do without anyones support all by their 18th birthday it is tough when you have no one to rely on this kind of funding that the house resolution offers is a chance to give a child like linda help at a time when she can really use it the letter goes on but i think it specifically states what we are all talking about here on the floor she says i have 20 more stories like this her words can better express based on her experience anything that i or my colleagues would say and i urge the support of this resolution"]]}
