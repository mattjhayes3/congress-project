of this special order signed by president hoover ina turbulent time the campaign that would lead to roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive

aimed at stopping the trafficking of illegal drugs is necessary mr javier perez de cuellar secretarygeneral of the united nations supports this concept and has established a task force to examine the

to the united states it is a worldwide problem that dictates worldwide strategies and cooperation the united nations has pledged to pursue vigorous international actions against drug abuse and illicit trafficking its now obvious that the united states cannot win the war on drugs alone we must work together witi our friends all over the world by passing this amendment we demonstrate the resolve of congress to fight drugs at every front at this point i would like to comment on the bill in general to say it is a good bill which i support of course theres only so much congress can do much is left up to local communities this is true in the area of drug abuse education although congress can provide valuable monetary assistance drug abuse education programs just as education in general is something left up to the states i am glad that this bill authorizes millions of dollars for drug abuse education because lets face it when all is said and done education is really the most effective way we are going to deal with the drug menace there must be a concentrated longterm effort to educate our people on the perils of drug abuse i stress here the word long term an example of how we can be successful with education is the protracted decadeslong effort to educate people on the hazards of smoking after decades of educating people on this we are now finally seeing results with smoking tailing off tremendously throughout the nation how did that happen through education when i was a young man no one know how bad smoking was for health now we are all aware of that not everyone has quit but no one can deny the great effect smoking education has had on reducing the number of people who smoke and whos to say a longterm education effort aimed at drug abuse wouldnt have similar success perhaps more afterall cigarettes are legal and therefore easier to obtain than most drugs and the negative effects of taking drugs often happen more quickly than from smoking cigarettes you dont often see people keel over dead from smoking a cigarette but we all know that can happen from taking drugs witness len bias along the lines of education we should be using the latest technology to got the point across the printed word used to be the key to education and still is important but todays youth must be exposed to the latest in videos dealing with antidrug themes i have worked with the department of education in this area and i praise the departments efforts in its production of 30 antidrug videos these videos which are scheduled to be released shortly are aimed at delivering creative effective antidrug messages to our nations students as a young man i viewed an antidrug movie that left a lifelong impression on me and i am hopeful that these new videos will be just as effective on the students of today i encourage my colleagues to learn more about this pro ect so that we here in congress can make sure that every school in our nation is aware of this valuable antidrug tool so lets commit ourselves to a longterm effort to educate people on the perils of drug abuse as is the case with most social problems there are no easy answers we cannot wave a magic wand

numerous hearings around the country over the last several years what we found was the the problem of early projections of election returns had two parts and therefore that any solution would also have to be a two part solution the first part of the problem was new in 1980 that was the network use of exit polls to make their election projections exit polls are interviews with voters as they leave the voting booth they have been around for several election cycles and have been used to provide accurate postelection information on voting patterns what was new in 1980 was the use of that data to predict the outcome of the election while voting was still going on eliminating that part of the problem turned out to be difficult any attempt to legislate restrictions on the television networks immediately becomes tangled in arguments over the first amendments rights of the press so we moved instead to exert public pressure on the networks to voluntarily refrain from announcing election results before polls are closed pressure came from many quarters including a congressional resolution that was passed overwhelmingly in 1984 calling on the networks to exercise voluntary restraint parenthetically it is interesting to note the pressure also came from within the news business even from some within the newsrooms themselves who seriously questioned the journalistic propriety of making news by predicting events before they occur early in 1985 that effort paid off we achieved a major breakthrough when the three television networks joined with westinghouse broadcasting and with turner broadcasting and agreed that they will not use their exit polling data to make election projections until the polls in a state are closed that agreement solved half the problembut not all of it the second part of the problem we found is simply that this is a large country spanning several time zones made up of states with widely varying poll closing times therefore polls in some parts of the country are closed hours before polls in other parts of the country furthermore we have a winnertakeall electoral college system in short it is quite possible for actual vote totals from places where polls are closed to reveal the outcome of an election while polls elsewhere are still open only a nationwide uniform poll closing time can prevent that from happening the senate first recognized this situation in the md1970s they passed uniform poll closing proposals on several different occasions unfortunately at that time the house did not act and when the problem was compounded in 1980 with the advent of projections based on exit polls we had to go back and solve the exit polling part of the problem first having done that we are once again to the point where a uniform poll closing time will finally and completely eliminate having the outcome of an election determined and announced before people in all parts of the country have had an opportunity to vote two years ago we set to work on this second part of our solution a uniform poll closing time the bills before us included sunday voting 24hour voting directing the federal election commission to select a poll closing time closing the polls at 11 e s t and closing the polls at 10 30 e s t we talked to secretaries of state local election officials political party people representatives of citizens groups and unions members of the house and local broadcasters by the conclusion of the hearings a general consensus had developed with respect to several potential aspects of a uniform poll closing proposal first election day should remain on tuesday second there was widespread agreement that any bill should apply exclusively to the presidential general election day not to other federal elections third any bill should address poll closing times only not poll openings states should be free to keep or alter their opening times as they see fit finally with respect to the actual poll closing time the hearings suggested that while a closing later than 9 could be difficult for election officials to administer a 9 closing in the eastwhich already exists in several stateswould be reasonable for the pacific time zone however the comparable poll closing of 6 is too early the poll closing time there cannot realistically be earlier than 7 local time what we had then was that in the eastwhere we were pleased that we found widespread willingness to contribute to a solutionelection officials felt they could administer a 9 closing but they made cogent arguments about the difficulties of a later time people in the west were willing to close their polls an hour earlier at 7 local time but felt that an earlier closing would have a detrimental effect on voter turnout since there is a difference of only 2 hours between 7 in the west and 9 in the east while the actual time difference between east and west is 3 hours we needed a way to eliminate an hour of time difference after weighing all the information data suggestions and ideas from our hearings the committee adopted a proposal put forward by the secretary of state of massachusetts and the secretary of state of california it is exactly the proposal currently included in h r 435 i should note that this proposal does not include alaska and hawaii since the only way to integrate them would be to have a much later closing in the eastern time zone we talked to people from both those states and they graciously agreed to remain outside a nationwide closing time that means the problem of early projections in those states will not be solvedbut it will be mitigated substantially under the plan now in h r 435 two things will happen first polls will close at 9 eastern standard timewhich is 8 c s t and 7 m s t second in the pacific time zone in presidential election years only in order to achieve a 7 poll closing daylight saving time will be extended for 2 weeks in four and onehalf states in the pacific time zone since 7 pacific daylight time is the same as 9 eastern standard time uniformity is achieved this proposal commended itself to the committee for a number of reasons among them are it achieves uniformity so all polls will close simultaneously on presidential election day it does so while keeping poll closing times within the limits9 in the east and 7 in the westthat election officials are confident they can administer effectively no state will be required to close its polls either later9 local timeor earlier7 local timethan many states now do similarly no state will be required to have a voting day either longer15 hoursor shorterl hoursthan some states now do more than onefourth of the states will not have to change their poll closing hours at all states that will be required to extend their closing hours will be extending them by less than under any other proposal and if they choose to adjust their opening times as they have complete authority to do the amount of change can be further reduced or eliminated altogether this is the proposal that passed the house last year with the addition of an amendment that will allow earlier closing times in a handful of precincts in one or two states when every eligible voter has voted unfortunately the bill was not acted on in the senate it died there at the end of last session we hope for a better result this time around to summarize since 1980 this committee has been assembling the pieces of a plan that will once again ensure at least a minimum degree of protection for election day the final step necessary to complete the plan is to have the voting process finish simultaneously across the country this bill h r 435 is that final stepthe one piece necessary to complete the solution this particular proposal has merit because of all those examined by the committee it is the least intrusivethe one that is least disruptive of the fragile process of administering elections in the tens of thousands of jurisdictions across the country responsible for the difficult expensive crucial remarkable work of conducting our elections year after year our country is so large and there is so much variety among the states in how they conduct elections that going into the hearings few members of the committee believed a solution could be found in which fully threefourths of the states would change by a maximum of 1 hour and in which no state will be required to do anything that is not already being done in other states and yet while this proposal makes modest changes in most states it is a complete solution one that will achieve uniformity one that will solve the problem i commend h r 435 to the house and urge all my colleagues to support it i am happy to yield such time as he may consume to the

democratic party will support i am quite frankly very disappointed that a truly bipartisan package which could be supported by the vast majority of democrats and republicans in this body was never seriously considered there was a real opportunity for such a package to be put together when the democratic alternative package was pulled from consideration last week as usual though we let partisanship get in the way of forging sound bipartisan foreign policy i have two fundamental problems with the bonior substitute first it ignores the presidents role in making foreign policy and second the substitute allows the department of defense to deliver aid to contras whereas that responsibility clearly falls under the purview of the cia it appears to me that we have already forgotten the lessons of the irancontra affair as the report states in its executive summary the policies of the united states cannot succeed unless the president and the congress work together the report also states that the principal recommendations emerging from the investigation are not for new laws but for a renewal of the commitment to constitutional government and sound processes of decisionmaking this premise is certainly overlooked in the substituteit doesnt even permit the president to trigger the ceasefire certification this is clearly a breach of separation of powers and it is an impediment in creating sound foreign policy second under the bonior substitute we have a cia operation for delivering the aid in everything but name only i would like someone to tell me why using the department of defense as cover for a cia operation is good policy isnt this legislative sleight of hand the type of thing that makes our constituents so cynical about the congressional process we had a similar scenario under the hamilton amendment a few years ago when we set up an agency within the state department to deliver humanitarian aid to the contras and we all know what a disaster that was why repeat the same mistake doesnt the irancontra report talk about the need for clear lines of authority and the delegation of responsibility how soon we forget let me finally conclude by saying that it is difficult for me to vote against the speaker to whom i have the highest respect but today i have been put into a position of choosing between the speaker or the president on a very important foreign policy question i have stood by our president on this question in the past and in good conscience i must stand by him again today"]]}
