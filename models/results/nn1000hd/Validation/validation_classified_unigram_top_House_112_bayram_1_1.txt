is bringing before the house today is reckless thoughtless and heartless and most disturbingly its a jobs killer i believe that the best way to reduce our deficit and longterm debt is to grow our economy to help businesses create jobs at a time when our economy is emerging from the worst recession in our lifetimes when millions of americans are out of work and millions more are struggling to make ends meet this continuing resolution takes exactly the wrong approach instead of making needed investments in education medical research infrastructure and other priorities this bill takes a meat axe to them instead of strengthening the middle class on main street this bill gives sweetheart deals for wall street instead of investing in our workers it protects special interest subsidies for big oil companies and hedge fund managers a few weeks ago on this floor republicans told us that veterans programs education child nutrition and health care research would be protected it is clear now that those were empty promises for veterans the bill eliminates a program that offers housing vouchers for homeless veterans in education the bill decimates the pell grant program by reducing the maximum award by 800 and by cutting another 4 9 billion from other education programs for child nutrition the bill cuts 750 million from the women infants and childrens program and the bill slashes 2 5 billion from the national institutes of health jeopardizing important research into diseases like cancer and alzheimers and diabetes it destroys the land and water conservation fund a commonsense program to preserve and protect our natural resources and outdoor recreational space helping local economies grow when we brought up the prospect of these cuts a few weeks ago we were accused of demonizing the debate now that we have seen the numbers before us i am sad to say it is worse than any of us could have predicted i find the cuts in education funding to be particularly troublesome as president obama made clear in his state of the union we must invest in our children if we are to compete in the 21st century economy in order to maintain our economic standing in order to create the jobs of the future in order to compete against china we must have a welleducated workforce so why on earth would we slash pell grants which help millions of families 12 000 in my district alone pay for college we shouldnt this bill will also decimate important lifesaving food aid programs to feed hungry children and refugees it would literally take the food out of the mouths of some of the most vulnerable people around the world retreating from the global war against extreme poverty and hunger will undermine not just our moral authority but our national security as well i also want to point out that this bill continues the same misguided policy under republican and democratic presidents alike that borrows hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for the wars in iraq and afghanistan if we are truly serious about reducing the deficit then those wars need to be ended or paid for along with my colleagues like walter jones and others im going to continue to talk about this issue these wars are bankrupting us and we need to have a meaningful thorough debate about them so again i believe this continuing resolution contains exactly the wrong prescription for our nation we should be focusing on creating jobs and growing our economy instead this republican bill would lead to more unemployment more unfairness and more hardship with the american people i urge my colleagues to reject this rule and reject this underlying bill"], [0.03093808889389038, 0.9690619111061096, 1, "when the wall street banking crisis of 2008 hit causing the worst recession since the great depression it was

thinking the system is rigged against them we all admire financial success but when we give away trillions in tax cuts that we cannot afford to those who need them the least its the middle class who has to make up the difference to pay for these tax cuts our republican colleagues have voted to end medicare and would force seniors to pay 6 400 more for their own care on top of that republicans propose changing social security slashing its budget by over 800 million its an ideological agenda that chooses millionaires over the middle class regular folks pay more so that folks like donald trump and mitt romney can get yet another tax break einstein is credited with saying that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results eleven

bill and the american people do not have the luxury of waiting any longer for congress to act to create jobs the president has proposed the american jobs act hes called upon us to pass the bill now we support that as do the democratic members of the house but today instead of passing a jobs bill we are wasting the time of the congress by attacking workers instead of strengthening them we are debating a bill to undermine the foundation of our middle class instead of fighting to put people to work rebuilding our roads bridges railways broadband lines schools airports and water systems we

on the subject of americas workers as congressman miller has said our republican colleagues have proposed the socalled outsourcers bill of rights or as i prefer to call it the outsourcers bill of wrongsbecause this legislation has the wrong priorities for americas economy and for american workers the bill is about more than one company or a single case it is about the economic security of americas workforce and families rather than create jobs this measure encourages the outsourcing of jobs and undermines the rights of middle class workers this bill cuts the national labor relations board makes it easier for corporations to ship jobs overseas and allows employers to punish their employees for simply exercising their rights to organize to demand better benefits and safer working conditions and to ensure a full days pay for a full days work for months in wisconsin ohio and states nationwide americans have seen republican governors and legislatures attack teachers and public servants and weve seen these workers union and nonunion alike inspire the nation to fight back now republicans have brought their assault on working americans to our nations capitol to the floor of the house claiming their actions will help the economy but it will do just the opposite it will weaken our workers our middle class and our familiesindeed the cornerstones of our economic prosperity of our middle class and of our democracy the outsourcers bill of wrongs or rightsis not about jobs its about dismantling protections established specifically to strengthen the rights of workers we

receivedsuch an honor for methe frances perkins award from my colleague lynn woolsey a champion for working families in our country for those of you who may not know frances perkins from history she was the first woman to serve in the cabinet of a president of the united states she was the secretary of labor and she was responsible for many important initiatives the 40hour workweek the ability for workers to bargain collectively she was a remarkable champion for working people in our country she was largely responsible for creating social security imagine having that as her credentials imagine what a thrill it was for me to receive an award named for her especially given by congresswoman lynn woolsey a champion on the education and workforce committee much of what she did the credit was given to the president of the united states as is appropriate more than 75 years ago upon the signing of the national labor relations act president franklin roosevelt said this by preventing practices which tend to destroy the independence of labor this law seeks for every worker within its scope that freedom of choice and action which is justly his i guess he could have said his or hers that independence that freedom of choice and action has rested at the core of a growing thriving american workforce it has not limited the ability of companies to move change or extend their operations it has simply ensured that companies treat their workers in ways consistent with the laws of our land the independence and freedom of our workers have helped build and expand our middle class which is the backbone of our democracy and drive unprecedented prosperity for our families and for our nation and it must be preserved in our time i call upon my colleagues to do just that to preserve this right in our time i call upon my colleagues to oppose this legislation to uphold the value of fairness for our workforce and to get to work putting the american people back to work by

rise in opposition to this amendment which would provide an exception for regulations that attempt to manipulate the price of oil gas and other fuels as i was listening to my colleague from across the aisle i was struck by the fact that he didnt actually mention any possible regulations that could do that i also would like to point out that our hands as congress are not tied this bill ties the hands of regulators if he is able to come up with a good idea to lower fuel prices he can bring it to congress we can pass it the senate can pass it and the president can sign it just the way the founding fathers intended just to be clear i also want to point out that nothing in h r 4078 prevents the administration from taking any number of actions that would increase the supply of domestic oil and gas and lower the price of gasoline at the pump the passage of this amendment however would do nothing to lower the price at the pump now i realize this amendment seems to preserve the option to impose price controls thats the only thing i could think of that it could do we learned back in the 1970s that price control does nothing but lead to shortage and lines at the gasoline pump theres absolutely no reason we need to return to the failed policies of the carter administration now if the current administration were truly interested in providing relief at the pump there are any number of actions they could do to increase the supply of oil and gasoline and lower the price at the pump but the obama administrations done little to tap into vast domestic resources that would increase the supply of american oil rather under president obama permitting and leasing on federal land is actually down alas the president has also vetoed or is opposed to the keystone pipeline which would have connected not only canadian oil to refineries in the south but would have also have connected the new finds in north dakota in the bakken shale sands canadian sands production is expected to double to 3 million barrels a day between 2010 and 2020 and domestic oil production will increase by as much as 20 percent the lack of a keystone xllike pipeline means slower less reliable and less safe forms of transportation that will continue to necessitate transporting domestic oil from north dakota by much more expensive and much less safe means of truck and rail rather than pipelines lowering the cost of that transportation would lower the cost of that crude oil and would lower the cost of gasoline at the pump as a matter of fact a barrel of north dakota sweet sells for 62 thats lower than the international price of oil predominantly because of the additional transportation costs necessary to bring it down to be refined in the refineries that are currently set up in this country if this bakken oil were made available to the rest of the country we would see an economic boom we would see lower prices for gasoline at the pump we would see more jobs in america the east coast in particular needs this oil and this gas made available to bring costs down bakken may lead to some price relief there but it will also open canadian oil we talk about energy independence but realistically north america is the energy unit that we should be looking at for providing our source as we tap resources throughout the united states canada and mexico we are going to be able to become energy independent much more rapidly than anyone ever thought as these new technologies develop to let us reach oil and gas deposits that we never even 10 years ago thought was possible i was talking to a geologist just recently when i attended a field hearing in north dakota and he told me when he was in school they always considered shale to be the source and would never be able to tap it but technology has proved that wrong and in fact even with our current technology were only getting a small percentage of the actual oil trapped in that shale im confident that as our technology develops that is going to become more and more available and this is going to take care of it but what we know is whats running up the price of oil and gas is excessive government regulation and if we can put a hold on government regulation so our businesses can know what they have to do to comply with those regulations and not have the goalposts moved in the middle of the game well have new refining infrastructure built well have new factories built well have new jobs created and we will get to an unemployment rate of 6 percent a whole lot faster i think than anybody is predicting this

million barrels from spr and still to this day hasnt replaced that oil but on top of that the president took those dollars billions of dollars and spent them on unrelated government spending so thats what the presidents been doing with sprusing it as his personal piggy bank and bailout fund for his failed policies the president and others like to talk about an alloftheabove strategy they love to talk about energy production never being higher one thing they fail to mention is that energy production on federal lands where the federal government actually has control is down in fact president obamas own administration the energy information agency confirmed again recently that production this year on federal lands is down 30 percent just in the gulf of mexico from last year so they talk about production being higher its higher on private lands where they have no control and by the way through epa and department of the interior and other federal agencies theyre trying to regulate and

develop the skills and experience they need to succeed and live out their american dream encouragingly president obama understands that we cannot speed up economic recovery without investments that create jobs i was pleased to see in his 2013 budget proposal critical investments to create good jobs and job training programs for communities hardest hit by our struggling economy by targeting economic assistance where its most needed the presidents proposed budget goes a long way to level the playing field to give every american the opportunity to succeed theres a lot that my republican colleagues can learn from the presidents budget especially this that fighting poverty and reducing the deficit can be achieved together but let me be clear this budget is not perfect there are cuts in this budget that would undermine some of the progress our economy is making cuts to safety net programs like the community services block grant low income heating assistance and affordable housing programs will hit already struggling families especially hard during these difficult times we really do need to protect programs that are a lifeline for the most vulnerable we need to increase funding for programs like snap and wic which keep millions of american families out of poverty but keeping people from suffering the worst effects of poverty is not enough to restore our economy even with the recent increases we have seen in job creation longterm unemployment remains at record levels with 5 5 million workers who have been out of work for 27 weeks or more until republican leaders in the

a problem we should be talking about things like environmental protection we should be protecting our natural world we should be addressing the dangers of climate change and we should be affecting that change to make sure that america is greener and cleaner and more sustainable thats the progressive caucus were the ones who could be found standing up for the constitution standing up for the idea of freedom of expression freedom of religion freedom of the press we will be found standing up for the idea the government must have the proper authorization and justification to violate peoples right to be left alone we also want to stand up and say that we believe that the progressive motion in america is what has made america this great nation we recognize our wonderful nation our great nation had a dream from the very beginning we had a dream but we also had a reality the dream was liberty and justice for all land of the free home of the brave the dream was that all americans and all men will be created equal endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that was the dream but the reality was america held slaves the reality was women couldnt vote the reality was the original people were relegated to an inferior status so people who believed in that dream people like martin luther king people like harriet tubman people like elizabeth cady stanton and people like susan b anthony people like eugene debs and people like walter reuther and other great americans they believed that that dream was worth fighting for and got out there and made the dream reality we werent trying to conserve the old order and status quo we were trying to progress toward a better america that really reflected that dream that i was just talking about the dream was that all americans are created equal the reality was segregation but americans who had a progressive vision said were not going to stay were not going to conserve segregation were not going to conserve robber barons who controlled all the wealth in the 1890s were not going to conserve the abuse of our environment rachel carson said were not going to conserve that were not conservatives were trying to make america better we believe in the greatness of this country and we are not going to stop until we get it so people like rachel carson said were going to have a clean environment and she wrote about it and she fought for it and people like martin luther king fought for civil rights and people like walter reuther fought for the right to organize and sometimes people who were in these movements gave their lives for the changes that they stood for and other times they were able to survive but the fact is they were all united in one progressive vision of what america should be about not trying to preserve racism slavery segregation gender oppression the progressive movement is what we stand for not conservatism thats not us were not them and dont want to be confused with them so tonight were here for a progressive message and were going to be talking about jobs and unemployment but i did want to take a moment just to let everybody know who the progressive caucus was because we dont want anybody to think that were something else than what we are the people who embrace the american dream and believe that america is such a great country we can overcome all the sins of the past and dont want to conserve any of them we want to go into a few key points tonight we wont be here the whole hour but we want to be strong while we are and so today we bring the people the progressive message to illustrate whats at stake in america today what are the things that were competing for what are we contesting for we come down we watch the events on the house floor and all across the america but what is the fight all about working families are getting crushed and our middle class is shrinking every day the working people of america are fighting to preserve a quality of life because a set of ideas has prevailed in america which basically says that any regulation is bad and what we say is that regulations if theyre protecting life protecting the environment and theyre helping the rules be fair and allowing americans to succeed and have opportunity theyre not bad but there are some people who never saw a regulation that they liked we believe protecting health and safety is a good thing we believe that getting rid of bad regulation or old regulation is just fine but these folks over here have an ideological commitment to any to ending any regulation and we recognize that this is exactly what has ruined our environment exactly what has caused global climate change and exactly what caused the financial disaster whats at stake in america here in america some folks believe that if the economy is going really really well what they need to do is have a tax cut for the wealthy if the economy is doing really really bad well what they need is a tax cut if the economy is doing sort of good and sort of bad what we need is a tax cut in other words the guys on the other side of the aisle they dont believe in taxes we in the progressive caucus believe that you shouldnt tax americans any more than is necessary but we believe that taxes are the dues that we pay to live in a civilized society we believe that if our taxes go so that there can be head start for our poor kids to be able to have a chance in life thats all right that if we have to pay taxes for police officers and firefighters and people who work on our roads to make them safe and make sure bridges are safe to cross were all right with that were not these folks who believe that you want to cut slash and burn and act like public workers and public employees are just you know not valuable we recognize they are valuable and im talking about people who work in parks and rec the police the firefighters but also the people who make sure that our water is clean and our environment is safe also people who make sure that our economic and financial system is safe people who make sure that when people that when some folks want to cut corners and just want to make a quick buck that theyre not going to be allowed to do that you need a cop on the beat a financial cop on the beat to make sure that good actors are rewarded and bad ones are punished so people who say oh we dont want any regulation because it would hurt jobs we dont agree with that we believe that jobs are going to come when we have middle class people having enough money to spend and then the businesses of our country have enough customers so that they can then add new people whereas our friends on the other side of the aisle believe that if you give people like mitt romney a lot of money maybe just maybe it might trickle down to the rest of us something might land on our heads well something has landed on our heads but its not rain or a good job its hard times economically trickledown economics supplyside economics is a failed policy it never worked they always want to say reagan well look at reagan reagan raised taxes plenty of times and so they even misappropriate his legacy but the fact is the progressive caucus is here to talk about whats at stake in america today now if you want to know whats really going on you could just look at this week here we are in washington supposed to be working hard on peoples business its not like a lot of big things arent going on weve got a payroll tax thats about to expire did we take that up on the house floor today no did we make sure that americans dont end up with a thousand dollars extra to pay over the course of a year as the payroll tax deduction goes up no oh this summer student loans are going to go up are going to double if we dont extend the law that would allow them to stay lower did we work on that no didnt touch that but heres what we did do this week in congress the republican majority didnt bring up a single bill to create jobs none of that they didnt bring up a single bill to help americans stay in their homes as we are in the midst of this foreclosure crisis that seems to never end they didnt bring up any bills to make sure that our air was clean and our water was safe to drink nor did they bring up any bills to rebuild our country no instead they were busy playing politics while people are hurting yesterday they brought up a bill to repeal an effort to help seniors get health care called the class act now the class act was a piece of the affordable care act some goodfaith people working in our government said you know there are some things that we need to fix with this bill before it works the way we want it to anybody who has ever made anything knows that sometimes that happens sometimes youve got to mend the thing that youre working on if youve ever cooked a meal sometimes you know youve got to put a little more sugar or salt or add a little more water legislation is exactly the same way you pass a law you think it can do certain things but when you get into the actual operation of it sometimes it doesnt work like you thought with this longterm care bill some good public servants said you know there are some kinks weve got to work out but instead of working out those kinks the republican majority just decided to strip the whole thing away so seniors who need longterm care the republican majority didnt say you know what heres our fix they just said get rid of what was already done we say build on what was done they say strip it away its too bad thats the position that they took but thats the position they took let me tell a few things about longterm care and why we need to strengthen longterm care and not strip away whats already been passed we have a longterm crisis in the united states today that the republicans who are in the majority in the house are not dealing with do you know 10 million americans need longterm care over the next decade another 5 million americans will require this care bringing the total to about 15 million people the problem is only getting worse and weve got to do something about it i wish my friends on the republican side would help us but even though they are in the majority theyre not nearly 70 percent of all people will need some level of longterm care after turning 65 years old that means anybody lucky enough to get to 65 there is approximately a seven in 10 chance youre going to need some longterm care assistance the number of americans 62 years and older is 20 percent higher than 10 years ago so america is aging and you know what this is a good sign we want americans to be healthy we want our seniors to be healthy and we want them to be strong and when they get into a health crisis we want them to have the care that they need and its also important to point out here that about 62 million unpaid family caregivers about 62 million unpaid family caregivers thats adult children of seniors about 62 million of these families provide care which if you put a dollar figure on it would amount to 450 billion in 2009 more than the total spending on medicare that year so families are stepping up but families need a little help i can tell you people are coming into my office every day people my age im 48 and they say my mom is getting older she needs help or she got sick somethings going on we need a fix for the longterm care and so with all of these problems that were facing with 70 percent of people who will need some level of longterm care by the time they turn 65 with the number of americans 62 years of age and older being 20 percent higher than 10 years ago with all of these issues you would think that the republican majority would step up and do something about it theyre in the majority but what has been their response an attempt to score political points not solutions they havent come with any solution they havent come with a proposal to fix longterm care they just want to strip what president obama and the democratic majority did and i think thats too bad now that was what we did yesterday we messed around they tried to embarrass the president it didnt work because americans know that president obama cares in fact i think republicans know it thats why they call it obamacare well he does care so they can say whatever they want but my point is today they were back up to their old tricks today we in congress voted on a budget gimmick billthats all you can really call ita bill to make it easier for republicans to pass more tax giveaways to the top 1 percent they call it the progrowth budgeting act and if i had a dime for every deceptively named piece of legislation during this 112th congress i think id be a wealthy man right now this legislation would rig the rules play games with the rules funny accounting to make it easier for the gop budget priorities to pass like the ryan budget which included deficitbusting tax cuts for the wealthy and cuts in jobcreating investments like education estimated to cost about 1 7 million jobs by 2014 this bill this funnymath bill this bill requires the congressional budget office to use what they call dynamic scoringthats the word they like to useas part of a macroeconomic impact analysis of tax provisions thats a whole lot of long words which basically says that they want to score it in a way that makes them look good thats what theyre trying to do and what they want to do is include calculating their effect on the economy like gdpthats all of the goods and services in a year domestically investments and employmentwhich past budget analysts have said are really not going to be an accurate reflection of whats going on when preparing supplemental cost estimates for major legislation such an analysis is designed to hide the impact of tax cuts on the budget deficit making tax cuts easier to enact or extending by masking their true costs this bill this funnymath bill injects supplyside economics into the congressional budget office scoring which has been discredited time and time again it has no place in the nonpartisan analysis provided to congress you see the cbo was set up so that neither the republicans nor the democrats the conservatives or the progressives none of us with our points of view could get in and mess around with the way the congressional budget office scored a bill what it means to score a bill is to analyze the costs of the bill or analyze the financial impact of the bill so it might be how much taxes is this going to generate the cbo the congressional budget office would give us an estimate or how much is this program going to cost the cbo tells us what are the budgetary implications of what were doing historically republicans and democrats have just had to live with the cbo score because its a nonpartisan office meaning neither party controls it but now what the republicans want to do is come up with this dynamic scoring thing to make their estimates look better this is wrong they shouldnt do it they shouldnt do it the underlying assumption behind the bill is that tax cuts pay for themselves this is obviously wrong the reason we are in this monumental debt and deficit situation that republicans like to talk about theyre always going on about were leaving debt on our children and grandchildren they always say it like that in a real dramatic way the reason were in this mess is because we got two unpaidfor wars under a republican administration and huge tax cuts under a republican administration they cut taxes during a war when youre really supposed to be raising taxes to pay for the war they cut taxes during the war which exploded all this debt thats the truth if they come down here and tell you the truth thats what they would say that two unpaidfor wars and the bush tax cuts are what exploded the debt and the deficit its why were in the situation that were in they always want to say oh obamacare thats not the cause of it they want to say oh oh the stimulus thats not the cause of it because that was an expenditure in a short period of time that didnt have long long tails like these tax cuts do or these wars thats what has exploded the deficit and now instead of owning up to it and saying we need to tax americans more fairly not just take care of the rich people but take care of everybody and make sure the burden is shared and not just the rich get to escape with not doing anything or not doing much some folks running for president are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and only pay 13 9 percent on it whereas if you make 50 000 60 000 youre going to pay 25 percent 28 percent or 35 percent depending on exactly how much you make its unfair what the republicans want to do is instead of just owning up and saying yeah we were fiscally irresponsible they just want to have dynamic scoring so it doesnt look so obvious now i talked about what we did yesterday which is try to do nothing about longterm care except embarrass the president and strip the class act out today we played games with the budget again with budgetcounting measures trying to interfere with how the nonpartisan congressional budget office does the scoring well what are we going to do tomorrow mr speaker certainly tomorrow must be better than the last 2 days particularly given the fact that we got the payroll tax deduction running out and other things important things going on are we going to take up the payroll tax deduction issue tomorrow no tomorrow were going to do something else another budgeting gimmick bill this time called the baseline reform act this is another one to try to hide the reality it requires the congressional budget officeand youll recall i explained that congressional budget office is sometimes referred to as the cboit requires the cbo to unrealistically assume in its baseline that spending in the future will stay the same and not grow to keep pace with inflation thereby facilitating cuts in real terms in jobcreating investments this bill ignores the impact of inflation on the discretionary budget which gives an unrealistic picture of what it will take to maintain basic services so understand it this way if inflation is making everything cost more but you try to hold the line then the cost of things will not be accurately reflected if you dont account for inflation but this is exactly what they dont want to do republicans want to starve these programs and they could lead to long backlogs for services and other types of problems such as the major issues at the walter reed hospital during the last decade relative to the traditional baseline a freeze would reduce investment for longrange programs such as rebuilding and educating america by over 20 percent and by the 10th year so there you have it three days of not dealing with what we need to deal with 3 days of playing games 3 days of not dealing with the peoples business 3 days of not focusing on what america needs us to focus onl so lets talk about the american people they have rejected the republican budget scheme that ends the medicare guarantee to pay for tax breaks for big oil millionaires and corporations that ship jobs overseas for the last year if youre not a ceo or a wealthy special interest the republican party of the 1 percent says youre on your own i often wonder what they meant when they said the ownership society what they really mean is the youre on your own society they mean hey we got to cut cities and towns and we got to cut states and we cant be there for you anymore you are on your own were going to lay off teachers were going to not give the cities enough to make sure theres enough police water fire all that stuff youre on your own but mitt romney is not on his own if you need a bailout youre not on your own but if your house is underwater dont look to the majority for help if youre a father who lost your job through no fault of your own a mother struggling to make ends meet or a family kicked out of your home the majority of the 1 percent says youre on your own turning their backs on ordinary americans may pad the profits of corporate donors and hedge funds of billionaires bankrolling their campaigns but it wont grow the middle class it used to be that working hard and playing by the rules meant you got a fair shot weve got to restore that dream were not talking about an american fantasy where everybody isyou see it on tv sometimes where youre going to be living in some lavish place and fancy this and fancy that and lifestyles of the rich and famous and all this kind of stuff were not talking about an american fantasy were talking about an american dream which is realistic because its not too much to ask that if youre willing to work hard in this country that this country should work for you but many americans out there are under a lot of stress and its because from a policy standpoint their elected leadership is catering to the people who have the most under the philosophy that if you give it all to the rich they will invest in plants and equipment and then it will trickle down to everybody else that philosophy has failed and its time for them to admit it we need leaders who understand that when we all do better we all do better americans have got to have a better shake and we in the progressive caucus are standing up for hardworking taxpayers of the great american middle class and working class and poor we in the progressive caucus are not ashamed to stand up for the poor we believe that poor people lowincome people what you call poor people are poor if theyre too old to work or too sick to work or too young to work anyone else might be poor by circumstance but they would love to join that great american middle class if they could just get a chance and that means an education that means job retraining and that means an economy where were literally trying to do something to protect the american worker from offshoring by investing in our infrastructure putting people back to work and by doing things to make this economy strong the best way to get our economy going is to put america back to work theres a lot of work to be done the best way to cut spending is to cut spending on tax handouts to millionaires billionaires and corporate special interests while we give 4 billion to the oil industry while theyre making the most money they ever made and they still come down here and scream oh dont take away our subsidies the american people know that the best way to cut spending is to cut spending on big special interests like wall street and big oil but instead republicans would rather make the rest of us pay for tax giveaways for millionaires and republican corporate donors like big oil and pharmaceutical companies so we want an america where the burdens are shared and where the benefits are also shared we want an america where there is true economic opportunity and inclusion we want an america where it doesnt matter whether if youre born here or you came here it doesnt matter what color you are it doesnt matter what religion you are it doesnt matter whether youre male or female or who you want to be married to that all of us can have a good prosperous life based on an economy that works for everybody and so i just want to say as i begin to wind up my remarks that this progressive caucus is going to be here standing up for the american people we will be there for the 99 percent we will work to get money out of politics as were pushing constitutional amendments to do so we will stand up to citizens united we believe that corporations are not people money is not speech and in america democracy is not for sale we believe unemployment insurance should be there for people who have fallen on hard times and we believe that the social safety net is something thats important so that when people need help they can get back up on their feet as i wind down i just want to point out that with nearly 14 million people unemployed today they deserve an opportunity in an america that really works for them they deserve leaders who care about their plight they need leaders who care about their plight and are willing to stand up and push policy that will make the american dream attainable for anybody who wants to work for it i just want to say as i close out america is a wonderful idea and the american dream should be in the grasp of every american and great americans have overcome some of the bad things in the past as they reached out to build the american dream for all and when i say liberty and justice for all i mean it and i just dont mean social equality i mean economic opportunity too and its going to have to start with asking everybody to pay their fair share recognizing that trickle down never worked and never will and that weve got to invest in america educate america and protect america so we can get this economy working again with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.06718339025974274, 0.06718339025974274, 0, "i thank my colleague from colorado we know that not all

total economic cost of 26 5 billion the highest total since at least 1981 the cost of regulations is a big obstacle for american job creators but when you think about regulations here are examples of some of the ones that can make you laugh the department of energy requires microwave makers to measure the amount of energy their products use in the off position the environmental protection agency wants stricter regulations on the amount of dust on american farms the department of the interior wants to impose a fee on christmas tree sales to promote christmas tree sales when you think about how government regulations destroy american jobs these are the statistics that will make you cry according to a louisiana state university professor the department of the interiors de facto moratorium of exploration in the gulf of mexico could cost 36 137 jobs in addition more than 80 000 jobs could be lost due to the epa regulations targeting the cement industry and finally epa greenhouse gas

job growth we are now at 29 months of unemployment in the united states of america being at or above 9 percent the president has to realize his policies have failed they have failed the american

per gallon representing an increase of about 40 cents from a year ago and about 20 cents from just 1 month ago citizens are suffering and they need relief it is important to point out in this context that when president obama took office gas prices were at about 1 85 per gallon now that they are up to about 3 75 per gallon we can see a steady increase over this 38month period of time of his presidency so far gasoline prices have risen an average of about 5 cents per gallon per month this is staggering when we think about the fact that if he is reelectedif he serves out the rest of this term and if he is reelectedthat is a total of an additional 58 months with that increase gas prices will be up at around 6 60 per gallon this is a lot of money it is staggering it affects everything we dofrom the miles we drive to the products we buy at the grocery store everything gets more expensive when the fuel we use to transport ourselves and our products becomes more expensive now to some extent one could suggest this was not only foreseeable but it was actually foreseen to some it was considered a desired outcome lets consider for example that in 2008 dr steven chu who now serves as president obamas energy secretary said somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in europe well mr chu it looks as though we are headed in that direction and if we continue to follow this administrations energy policies we may get there as a member of the senates energy and natural resources committee i was somewhat surprised when a suggestion was made just a few days ago that there are some who believe there is no relationship between unitedstates production of petroleum and the price of gasoline in the united states that simply is not true and it cannot be true with oil being the input ingredient into gasoline it is the precursor for gasoline anytime we do anything that cuts off or restricts or limits the supply that is necessarily going to have an impact on the price and it does the fact that it is indisputable that there are other factors which also influence the price of gasoline makes it no less true that we have to produce petroleum at home in addition to buying it from other places in order to keep gasoline prices at reasonable levels we have to produce more there are some things we can do in order to help improve that trend for example we could open anwr for drilling we could open our countrys vast federal public lands to development of oil shale it is a little known fact that in three rocky mountain states a small segment of rocky mountain statesutah colorado and wyomingwe have an estimated 1 2 trillion barrels of proven recoverable oil reserves locked up in oil shale now 1 2 trillion barrels is a lot of oil that is comparable to the combined petroleum reserves of the top 10 petroleumproducing countries of the world combinedjust in one segment of three rocky mountain states yet we are not producing it commercially in part to a very significant degree because that oil shaleespecially in my state the state of utahis overwhelmingly on federal public land and it is almost impossible to get to it to produce it commercially on federally owned public land we need to change that we need to create a sensible environmental review process for oil and gas production generally we need to improve the permitting process for offshore development in the gulf of mexico and in other areas we need to allow the states to regulate hydraulic fracturing without the fear of suffocating and duplicative federal regulations we need to keep all the federal lands in the west open to all kinds of energy development and of course we need the president to approve the keystone xl pipeline this will contribute substantially to americas energy security and will provide an estimated 20 000 shovelready jobs right off the bat there are things we can do to help americans with this difficult problemone that will affect almost every aspect of the daytoday lives of americans we need government to get out of the way we need the government to become part of what the president laudably outlined as an alloftheabove strategy in his state of

with iran i would ask where on the turkishiranian border will these frigates be deployed the last time an oceangoing vessel has been seen in eastern anatolia it was noahs ark now these frigates will

turkish prime minister erdogan called for israel to be punished for interfering with the previous effort to aid hamas with the flotilla in september 2011 after a u n report on the gaza flotilla was

our contractors some certainty to our communities so that we can start to grow again and see jobs proliferate but i find it ironic that the gentleman complains about paying for it because he talks about our wanting to open up our resources our resources offshore our resources in anwr as number one an attempt to allow america to develop finally a national energy policy but to also promote jobs the gentleman knows as i do the energy sector provides an awful lot of jobs in plenty parts of this country and can do a lot more and is willing private capital willing to deploy to create jobs but i find it also ironic that the gentleman complains that theres no bipartisanship because somehow were not working with the administration well the administrations been absent on all of this theyre not interested in working with us to create a product where we can see jobs created as you can see the secretary sits in his office and opines and attacks the bill saying it is all the negative things that he said now thats not a way to collaborate and work together and the gentleman knows that as well the gentleman knows that that is certainly not how things have worked in this town if you want to produce a result so the gentleman can claim the mantle of wanting to work together and that the administration is being trampled by some action here he knows good and well that this administration has been absent in so many of the discussions on so many important issues and the fact that we differ on policy yes but i think the gentleman also knows that reasonable people can disagree but that doesnt mean that we cant work together to find some things that we agree on certainly we agree on jobs the gentleman says we agree on small business im looking for his support of that small business tax credit bill and we agree on infrastructure spending being an important part of our economy so im looking forward to the next week or so as the bill works its way to the floor to hopefully garner his support"], [0.7819426357746124, 0.21805736422538757, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i really am honored to be on the floor with two great congressmen congressman pallone and congressman lance

may consume this important resolution urges the nations of europe and the european union to designate hezbollah has a terrorist organization and to impose sanctions on it we know from our experience with iran that sanctions and in fact all diplomacy are most effective when they are multilateralthe more multilateral the better we are particularly strong in such matters when we and our friends and allies in the european union stand shoulder to shoulder thats why europes seemingly inexplicable refusal to classify hezbollah as a terrorist group has been so disappointing over the years hezbollah is a charter member of the foreign terrorist organizations list in the united states its crimes are legion spread over many continents and far too numerous to list here they begin in the early 1980s with deadly bombings of the unitedstates embassy and the unitedstates marine and french army barracks in beirut and they have continued up to the present day i still remember ronald reagan president reagan talking about it after so many of our marines were murdered in lebanon let me mention just a few of the other lowlights countless kidnappings of americans and europeans in the 1980s and 1990s the khobar towers attack that killed 19 americans in 1996 the 1992 bombing of the israeli embassy and the 1994 bombing of the jewish community center in buenos aires again with multiple killings the murders of americans in iraq and the training of other iraqi militants and countless assassinations in lebanon including most likely that of former prime minister rafik hariri in 2005 in 2006 hezbollahs unprovoked murder of three israeli soldiers caused a war during which hezbollah rocketed civilian targets in lebanon and used lebanese civilian as human shields over the past 2 years it has staged attacks from turkey to thailand today it has forces in syria fighting on behalf of assad and the murderous assad regime and helping to train assads thugs in addition this year hezbollah twice has been directly implicated in terrorism on european union territoryin bulgaria where a suicide bomber killed five israeli tourists and a bulgarian and in cyprus where an apparent hezbollah terrorist attack was thwarted the failure of most european nations to designate hezbollah has been based on the flimsiest of reasons namely that hezbollah provides social services to the shiite community and participates in electoral politics in lebanon in fact hezbollah takes a very novel approach to electoral politicsusing a militia to intimidate voters into voting for them by the way its a lesson that hamas has learned very very well but europes failure to designate hezbollah as a terrorist group is not merely a problem because it accords legitimacy to a terrorist organization rather it has important operational consequences as well the failure to designate makes it more difficult to prosecute cases against hezbollah crimes committed in europe it allows hezbollah to use eu territories to fundraise recruit new members propagandize and train and thus the freedom hezbollah enjoys in europe ultimately affects noneuropeans as well the european union obviously will make its own decisions on this matter but its hard to escape the conclusion that the eus failure to designate hezbollah undermines both europes security and ours as well the state departments top counterterrorism official recently said that hes cautiously optimisticat lastabout the prospects for an eu designation of the group i hope his optimism is justified until it is borne out with an actual terrorist designation however it is important that we join the senate in going on record as urging the european union to make that designation which would be so beneficial to the fight against terrorism worldwide and to our own national security i urge my colleagues to support this resolution and i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.7586134970188141, 0.2413865029811859, 1, "i yield myself 2 minutes the conference

"good morning my colleagues like most of you i have taken so many things around this wonderful capitol for granted and this beautiful statement in god we trust unfortunately for me has been one of them it has not really struck me like the pledge of allegiance to the flag or the star spangled banner or so many other things but i think that now is the time that we really need god to guide us to do the right and the moral thing and the reason we have to do it is because were dealing with something that is basic to all religions and faiths and this is our responsibility to make certain that we balance our budget do what is fiscally necessary for our great nation to survive but also to do it in such a way that the poor and the vulnerable who have nothing to do with the crisis that we face are not hurt so i guess this is what were talking about when we say in god we trust but god works through us we are the tools we have the responsibility of the missionaries we dont have lobbyists that come down to say protect those people and i guess this is one of the reasons why this saying here is a constant reminder to us that even though were carried away with our ability to create statutes that we respect our court system and the supreme court in the final analysis its the higher authority of morality that should be guiding all of us recently i called upon religious leaders to help us in this guidance to make the right decisionschristians catholics protestants muslims mormons jews and gentiles and i was so pleased that a long and dear friend named jim wallishes a lutheran pastor was an adviser to the president and just yesterday he brought in a group of ministers to help the president to make the moral decision as he struggles so hard to make the proper decision as it affects our budget and how were going to reduce our deficit but the things that he had cited like matthews truly i tell you whatever you did for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine you did for me what it is is that whatever you have done to assist a poor person or those who are not as strong physically and financially as you and i that you really did this in a sense for jesus because you have done the right thing and then he goes on to have something that sounds like statutes when it says woe to those who enact unjust statutes and who write oppressive decreesoppressive decreesdepriving the needy of justice and robbing poor people of their rights is health care a right is social security a right is decent housing education the pursuit of happinessis all of this a right and does this permeate the entire budget and every decision that were trying to make well in these statements that he made we have the torah that says the same thing if there is a poor man among your brothers in any of the towns of the land we have a responsibility the koran indicates believe in allah and his messengers and spend on charity and so my brothers and sisters it seems to me that now is the time for us to really get in touch with the gang of six because it seems like nobody in the house of representatives has any clue as to what ultimately the president and his advisers will decide certainly the senate doesnt know what we will decide but somehow we should include not just the question of revenue not just the question of trillions of dollars to be cut but in the course of these negotiations to think of the lesser of our brothers and sisters remember that it is a part of our very lives in saying in god we trust and to know that you just cant cut services without losing jobs

to the public her testimony places the mf global collapse in proper perspective and im quoting directly she said lehman brothers and refco are the two most recent futures commission merchant bankruptcies while the lehman brothers bankruptcy was monumental in scale and the refco bankruptcy involved serious fraud at the parent company commodity customers did not lose their money at either firm in both instances commodity customer accounts were wholly intact that is they contained all open positions and all associated segregated collateral that being the case customer accounts were promptly transferred to healthy fcms or futures commission merchants with the commodity customers having no further involvement in the bankruptcy proceeding unfortunately that is not what happened at mf global because customer accounts were not intact the fact that customer accounts were not intact as commissioner sommers described it means that someone took other peoples money i believe most of us would call that theft even if some of the money is recovered by the bankruptcy process that does not alter the fact that the process by which customer accounts were violated broke the law it is an understatement to say that many american families and businesses lost important investments the mismanagement of this one firm has put hundreds of peoples investments in jeopardy they deserve answers congress has lead responsibility to ask hard questions and here are some questions that demand reply on transfers of funds from customer accounts congress must ask examiners from chicago mercantile exchange group who said that transfers at mf global were made in a manner that may have been designed to avoid detection so let us ask should the person or persons who attempted to avoid this detection be held accountable and how should that occur it seems unlikely mr corzine is not responsible so which person or persons at mf global made the decision to invade customer accounts congress must assure full tracing of those transactions a second group of questions should revolve around who are the responsible parties if mr corzine simply cannot recall or does not know what happened at mf global as he seemed to claim who should congress and investigators speak with at mf global to ascertain his exact role and those of other top executives whos going to probe thats the role of a congressional investigatory committee who besides mr corzine was directly responsible for segregating customer account funds from mf global funds over 1 billion did not walk off on its own some set of persons at mf global moved those funds and its highly implausible that no one authorized that action so what set of persons authorized those actions exactly another set of questions should revolve around who approved mf globals risk standards we know that michael roseman mf globals former chief risk officer who resigned in march 2011 reportedly assessed that the strategy that mf global was undertaking was too risky any assertion that the strategy was prudent at the time as mr corzine is arguing is against the facts of history because mf global went bankrupt congress needs to take whatever steps are necessary to find out exactly who pressured mr roseman to resign for blowing the whistle on the behavior inside that company another set of questions can be asked about what other financial partners participated in mf globals trades there are allegations that the transfer of 200 million to j p morgan in the final days of mf global was suspected by j p morgan bankers of utilizing mf client funds to what extent are these allegations true at what point can we determine whether wire fraud was committed and if so by whom and to what extent all of this begs the ultimate question of whether or not sufficient protections were exercised for customers to stop wire fraud another set of questions can revolve around were any inside players aiding and abetting mf globals behavior we know that current commodity futures trading commission chairman mr gensler has recused himself from the case mr gensler actually worked for mr corzine at goldman sachs and they apparently carried on later in the same social and academic circles the public has a right to know at what point mr gensler had any knowledge or reason to believe that the customer accounts at mf global might not have been intact and then how did he and his agency and his staff respondday by day hour by hour email by email finally according to reuters companies like koch industries removed billions from mf global just before it filed bankruptcy how did that powerful company know when to take their money out and why did my constituents not know when to take their money out could in fact koch industries have gotten the same tipoff that goldmans ceo hank paulson had given freddie mac investors and fannie mae investors just a few years before how much of mf globals money not wired rightfully belongs to the holders of segregated accounts that were inappropriately tapped by mf global how do my constituents get full restitution yes there are far too many questionslots of questionsand far too few complete answers yes this congress needs to take white collar crime more seriously who would accept an explanation as we heard the other day that i did not intend to steal it could be 100 from the corner gas station right how can that be an acceptable answer for taking hundreds of millions and over 1 billion rigorous investigation matters congress needs more robust hearings we need more thorough investigations what should concern all of us is that the financial industrys fraud and imprudence yes addictive behavior is not limited to a case here or there in the financial services sector fraud has become systemic it is endemic it has harmed our nations economy to its vitals and has hurt millions of people across our country and the financial systems of other countries in 2009 the fbi testified before the house judiciary committee that the current financial crisis and im quoting directly has produced one unexpected consequence it has exposed prevalent fraud schemes that have been thriving in the global financial system these fraud schemes are not new but they are hitting the economy hard and the public is hurting as a result of market deterioration what a true statement regretfully this isnt the first time that our country has seen a crime wave in the financial services industry indeed the crimes and addictive behavior seem to be getting bigger not smaller in the 1980s it was the savings and loan crisis then the fbi responded with a staff of 1 000 agents and forensic experts based in 27 cities do you know how many they had over there when this started fortyfive you could count them on your own hands perpetrators went to jail back then but rather the congresses at that time ignored the warnings of what had happened and they gave an even bigger green light during the 1990s to more abuse by removing the rules of the road for banking during the 1990s example the upending of the glasssteagall act in the late 1990s that blew the lid off prudent banking and allowed bankers and speculators to be in the same company and look what has happened we need to restore the glasssteagall act and i have a bill to do that and there are dozens and dozens of cosponsors on that bill in 2000 the surreptitious undermining of derivative regulation by this congress led to wall streets bullish plunder that we are now experiencing again the result of addictive behavior of the 2000s you know when you go back to the savings and loan crisis that was much smaller than what we are enduring today that is why i have a straightforward bill h r 1350 the financial crisis criminal investigation act it authorizes an additional 1 000 agents and forensic experts for the white collar crime division of the fbi to investigate and prosecute these financial crimes i encourage all of my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor the bureau does not have anywhere near the resources it needs to take on crimes of this magnitude and dimension congress has long debated what level of regulation is needed to restrain financial addicts there should be no debate about the need to uphold the law to recover innocent peoples money to prosecute the addicted gamblers to set a strict standard of behavior in the financial sector so it simply never happens again so that we can restore confidence and regular order not insider abuse to americas financial markets i think this congress has an awesome responsibility to do its job and it should not fear anyone the committees of this house should be working overtime to probe the truth to find the truth to get at the truth of those who have harmed america that have put so many millions of people out of work where so many homes have been foreclosed that the property values of this country cant even find their footing at this point its affecting capital formation its affecting the ability of local banks to make loans because theyre not sure whats going to happen to valuation on their books what could be more serious than the committees of this congress doing their job i want to commend congressman lucas of oklahoma i want to commend congressman peterson of minnesota wouldnt it be wonderful if they could continue their important work but that the other committees of this congress that have responsibility for oversight government oversight and reform the judiciary committee the financial services committee the energy and commerce committee were actually to do the work that needs to be done to put this countrys banking and financial system back in a decent position with prudent rules and to
