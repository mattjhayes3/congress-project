no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee and in so doing want to take this opportunity to

by press reports that the administration might settle its dispute over steel imports with the europeans through bilateral agreements which would not protect the interests of the american steel industry according to the reports much pressure was being exerted by the european economic community eec to reach a settlement that would prove unfavorable to our domestic producers consequently the executive committee met in an emergency meeting on thursday morning july 21 1982 and agreed unanimously to inform secretary of commerce malcolm baldrige of opposition to the european offer that same night secretary baldrige rejected the european offer to limit steel exports to 90 percent of the 1981 levels i would like to submit here for the record the official press release of the commerce department on this decision the unitedstates department of commerce could not accept a lastminute proposal by the european communities ec to suspend 12 steel countervailing duty cvd investigalions involving belgium france italy and the united kingdom because the legal requirement of removing the apparent injurious effects caused to the unitedstates industry by subsidized steel imports was not met the proposals were formally presented to commerce secretary malcolm baldrige at 5 30 thursday by the ambassadors of the four countries accompanied by representatives of the ec the contents of the proposals had been received that morning the ec requested that the commerce department suspend the investigation on the basis of quantitative restraint agreements as permitted in unitedstates law under that provision the deadline for reaching an agreement is midnight july 24 in announcing his decision baldrige said we welcome any attempt by the community to settle the unfair steel trade cases between the unitedstates and the ec but unfortunately these proposals are not legally acceptable unitedstates law requires that any quantitative restraint suspension agreement must eliminate the injurious effect of subsidized exports of the subject merchandise to the united states since the steel imports from the ec that caused the injury increased almost 30 percent from 1980 to 1981 the 10 percent reduction offered today from the higher 1981 levels was simply not sufficient to remove injury as required baldrige stated that if acceptable suspension agreements could have been concluded on these products the steel trade tension between the ec and the unitedstates would still not have been eliminated he noted that 19 antidumping ad cases on the same products and 13 other ad and cvd cases are still pending baldrige felt that an overall settlement leading to withdrawal of all cases was the best way to relieve the current trade tension and repeated his willingness to continue discussions with the ec to find an equitable basis to deal with the problem in its entirety as well as the proposed suspension agreements the ec required that the unitedstates accept all of the 12 proposed agreements or none in its decision the doc compared the ecs suggested restraint level to the levels at which the unitedstates international trade commission made preliminary determinations of injury in 1980 and 1982 most of the proposed restraint levels were above the levels found to be injurious by the itc doc also considered the current state of the unitedstates industry now running at less than 45 percent utilization and the level of subsidies found in the june 10 preliminary determinations which in one case amounts to 40 percent subsequent to that decision the secretary made a counterproposal to the eec that provided about a 20percent cut in steel imports unfortunately the europeans turned that proposal down in the meantime in accordance to the relevant trade laws future negotiations on these cases will require the commerce department to seek the approval of the domestic steel industry before reaching a settlement now i have been advised that the secretary will pursue additional discussions along these lines this week in brussels it would seem to be in the interests of the european community to 11 4692 co participate in these negotiations otherwise they will risk final determinations and penalties i urge the secretary to do everything in his power to settle these cases as soon as possible in order to get our steelworkers back on the job a mr bevill the war being waged against the american steel industry by foreign steel producers has taken yet another twist news reports indicate that several of the european governments which have been accused of subsidizing their steel mills and permitting them to dump their steel in this country at prices far below production costs have been applying equally unfair pressure on this government to let them plea bargain their way out of the trade suits filed against them these news reports indicate that the europeans have used the russian gas pipeline deal and other diplomatic issues in an attempt to exert a form of international blackmail against our government they want to force a negotiated settlement without the consent of the injured american steelmakers which brought the complaints if they are successful our domestic steel firms would suffer even further losses of jobs sales and would have to have longer delays in their efforts to modernize their plants further the european nations pressuring for favorable settlements want a guarantee that there will be no future filings against them of additional antidumping cases or countervailing duty that would provide them with free reign to systematically destroy our domestic steel production capabilities already basic steel employment in america stands at a depressing 49year low if current trends continue our steel producers can expect to lose 2 billion during this decade and another 100 000 american steelworkers will be without jobs as a member of the executive committee of the steel caucus i want to express in the strongest terms possible my sincere belief that our government must not turn its back on our own steelmakers who have lived within the law the cases they have filed are a test of the law and i believe americans want to see that law enforced the world is watching this important trade issue and our future international trade could be affected greatly by the outcome if the law is not enforced in this area we

people who have the greatest needs in our society i just would point out just to clarify the record the chairman has done that the reallocation of 25 percent that is allowed has to be done on the basis of rank not on the basis of skills therefore there is nothing except the reenlistment bonuses that allows us to address that problem the only point i would make to the gentleman also is that instead of being 7 to 22 percent when you add in the housing and the baq and subsistence actually it is a 10percent increase overall for the person at the lowest end the enlistee plus the enlistees pay goes uip in the very first year that hie is in the service and his pay increases by 16 percent so we are trying to also be fair under our approach to the most junior enlistee but what we are really concerned about is the training and the investment that we have in those ncos trying to make sure that that enlistee has a good military experience and reenlists at the end of his first term mi dellums i thank my colleague for his comments i appreciate the clarification i think we could debate that issue all day all week but it seems to me that the reality is that the differences here to some extent are rather subtle it would seem to me that there is no need to prolong the issue i simply stand in the wvell saying there are two proposals they both address the problems that we choose to confront and reasonable people can differ i simply come down at this particular moment on the side of the armed services committee for the reasons i have articulated"], [0.000293731689453125,

yield i was a staff attorney mr courter i yield to the genwith the legal services corporation tleman from pennsylvania for about 2 years i personally feel mr walker the gentleman made that the organization has done a tre reference to the fact that we built promendous amount of good for a great tections into the authorization that many people was passed in 1981 there have been a i know we live in a time when budg number of references on the floor here ets are 200 billion in deficit and when to those prottetions we can look back and cite chapter and can the gentleman tell me whether verse regarding some abuses that at those protections are in effect right torneys that worked in legal services did that they were more concerned about creating new law than they wereimagine about ceraing nhew lawr than they were that most of those protections are in about serving the poor that they were more concerned about initiating class effect right now no 1 no 2 if they actions than they were about handling are not i would say that is a problem landlord and tenant cases and making regarding enforcement of the law and suretha matimoial isptes erenot the law itself the law is not the sure that matrimonial disputes were polm hn esoeotvr handled in a proper and civil manner i suppose i would be much more clearly about 18 months ago so if you pleased with the amendment if it have a concern with some legal serveliminated all of the money from ices offices some board of directors legal services because then it would not following the mandates of this be obvious as to its true intention congress then that is an enforcement for those of us who felt there was problem it is not a legislative problem some overreaching some overbearance mr walker if the gentlemen will by

those that services corporation who were not need it the very most happy with some of the amendments i want my colleagues to recognize that were added to that bill when it the impact of this type of a cut of 141 went through the house some of the million in 1975 federal funding for protections that were built in the legal services corporation was ap the language in the house bill last proximately 71 million in inflation year and the language in the house adjusted dollars that comes in 1982 to bill this year indicates that we are 130 million so what the amendment trying to keep those protections from is doing is obviously bringing it back 1981 in place however last year that before 1975 language we struck in conference and the number of counties served in we did not get those protections so the united states during the past therefore they are not in place today number of years from 1975 to 1982 in we have no assurances that that lancreased from 946 to 3 144 i represent guage will not be struck this year that is one of the concerns we have that in fact we have no such protections now and we may not have them in the future"], [0.0003535151481628418,
