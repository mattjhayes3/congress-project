we deal with the problems particularly on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year"], [0.008477210998535156, 0.9915227890014648, 1, "i want to begin by welcoming our new members and by thanking the gentlewoman from ohio congresswoman

cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in american corporations together these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of african americans and they will

that will do real damage if enacted h r 5538 is a bill that is riddled with antienvironment riders among other harmful provisions which are intended to diminish the ability of the department of interior and the environmental protection agency to protect public health and the environment as ranking member of the science committee i am certainly familiar with the antiepa rhetoric emanating from too many on the majority side fortunately their attempts to override the growing chorus of american voices demanding action on climate change is failing and communities across the nation are showing strong support for epas efforts to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions implement tighter ozone standards and protect public health unfortunately there are those in this house who apparently have turned a deaf ear to the american people and instead provide a forum for those who seek to undermine epas work seemingly at every turn this bill is another vehicle for implementing those obstructive views there is no greater evidence of this reality than the blanket prohibition found in this bill on any epa action to address methane emissions from the oil and gas industry while the people in california are still reeling from the largest methane leak in unitedstates history it seems unconscionable to me that we would prohibit epa from taking any action on issues related to methane emissions in addition some of my republican colleagues have grown fond of insisting that epa should only rely on publically available scientific information to support their rules and actions while the goal of a transparent government is laudable the consequence of their insistence is not a more transparent epa but an epa that would be limited as to what science they may consider as my colleagues and i have said before we cannot support a bill and accompanying report that limits or prohibits epa from using the best and most relevant science moreover in response to perceived delays in providing documents requested by congress the authors of this legislation would seemingly punish the hardworking men and women of epas congressional affairs office by reducing their budget request by 4 million dollars if my colleagues really want to address epas inability to provide timely responses to an ever increasing amount of congressional document requests they would not cut the budget of the office tasked with providing those responses it may feel good to those proposing the cut but it is a selfdefeating approach to addressing the ostensible problem finally i would note that a number of amendments have been made in order that if adopted will only make a bad bill worse i intended to oppose them when they come up for votes in closing i cannot support an appropriations bill that

such a phenomenal job not just on behalf of the people she represents in the great city of columbus ohio but all throughout the nation in her various roles and certainly in her leadership in the congressional black caucus it is with a heavy heart that i stand on the floor of the house of representatives today and with great sadness acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in orlando florida the worst mass shooting in the history of the united states of america it is a complicated shooting we understand that it most likely is an act of terror a hate crime of unspeakable proportions there are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse the shooter appeared to have been in some measure on the fbis radar but you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in congress have the capacity to deal with and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destructionwhich should be reserved for war not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic republicand inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others martin luther king jr once said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends during the 114th congress there have been more than 100 mass shootings we often come to the floor of the house of representatives and the speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us as members of the house to stand in a moment of silence and then we go on with business as usual having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in america the rest of the world is looking around and saying what are they doing in the united states of america five percent of the worlds population 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land the fbi and local law enforcement cant tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice this is an issue of course that has great impact on the african american community homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger african american men so we in the cbc view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community i think it is one that all americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country but the thing that is also troublingand we will have time to deal with this tragedyis hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list cant purchase weapons of mass destruction how complicated is that to do but the thing that is striking for many of us in the african american community is that when you look at some of the leading causes of deathheart disease being number one and then of course diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic certain forms of cancer hiv aids infectionmany of these illnesses these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that i represent in central brooklyn in bedfordstuyvesant in east new york in ocean hillbrownsville in canarsie and in the west end of coney island are preventable preventable by better exercise preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many lowincome communities of color have been subjected to resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness preventable by better diet senator booker recently said to many of usand this has stuck with methat more african americans in the united states of america die as a result of drivethroughs not drivebys that is because the diet the access to healthy food is limited the food deserts within which many african americans particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level are forced to reside in are scandalous so we in the congressional black caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful comprehensive fashion i am thankful that back at home in the west end of coney island coney island cathedral one of the most important religious institutions in brooklyn is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists a lack of access to healthy food in the black community it is a campaign that we want to take across the nation we are thankful for the work that has been done by the congressional black caucus and by president obama through his leadership of the affordable care act we now know that over 20 million previously uninsured americans now have access to quality affordable health caredisproportionately african american that is a positive step in the right direction but instead of trying to dismantle this monumental step forward as house republicans have attempted to do more than 60 times over the last few years they have a clinical obsession with a law that has been declared constitutionalnot once but twiceby the united states supreme court lets figure out ways to come together as a nation despite our racial religious and ethnic differences to deal with the disparities that exist in the african american community and beyond and let us come together as a congress and as a nation to deal with the scourge of hate in its most recent form directed at the lgbt community down in orlando in such a horrific and invidious fashion we are better than this we can do much better here in the united states congress the congressional black caucus is here to lead the way on issues worked in partnership hand in

latinos some have immigrant parents and most will soon be eligible to vote all of them have one question for me it starts every q and a at every high school i visit the questions are about donald trump is he going to be our next president is it true that he wants to revoke our citizenship and deport us to the countries our parents came from is it true he wants to round us up mr gutirrez and deport us all it is very sad when the questions a congressman gets from american high school students are about how much they should fear their own government whether their own government is going to break up their families whether their own government is going to treat them not as citizens and as equal partners but as outsiders and pariahs in their own country when they hear that trump is leading in the polls they think that means there is a pretty good chance that he will be the next president when they see him on tv shows like jimmy fallon not to mention cnn and fox news they get the feeling that he is a celebrity that all of us in america admire when they hear that trump is hosting saturday night live not just being a guest but actually hosting even after saying mexican are mostly rapists criminals and drug dealersthey get the impression that calling whole groups of people rapists criminals and drug dealers based on their ethnicity or national origin is basically okay with us in america the real question these chicagoarea high school students have is hey gutierrez what are you going to do to defend us from donald trump what are you going to do to stand up for us this leads to an intense discussion about american politics and i ask the students right back what are you going to do to stand up for yourselves for your community look motivating 17 and 18yearolds to do something is not always easy including motivating them to register to vote when they are old enough and to actually go out and vote but when i ask these young americans whether they plan to get registered and vote every hand goes up in the classroom donald trump is spurring youth voter mobilization like i have never seen before nationally we know that 93 percent of latinos under the age of 18 are citizens of the united states and that every 30 seconds a latino citizen turns 18 that is about a million a year for the next decade or so if they are half as motivated as the young people i am talking to in chicago donald trump could have a tremendous impact on the youth vote in the coming election but lets be honest do we really want to motivate civic participation through fear of deportation racial profiling and families being broken up these are american teenagers growing up to distrust their government trump wants to take us back to the good old days of race relations which apparently means the 1950s when president eisenhower evicted millions of immigrants and unitedstates citizens from the united states dr carson who believes that human history is only about 5 000 years oldthat is what he says we have only been around 5 000 yearssays of mass deportation schemes i think its worth discussing here in the house we have considered measures to deport children more quickly to make groups more distrustful of the police and to delay homeland security funding testifying on one of these bills before the rules committee last year i made the unfortunate but real suggestion that republicans were gravitating toward mass deportation policies which provoked a response from the chairman mr sessions he said gutierrez there is no one in responsible republican leadership that has said we should deport 13 or 11 million people and i find it extremely distasteful that people would come here and suggest things that we have not suggested well now that people are suggesting mass deportation openly and are gaining in the public opinion polls in the republican party i wonder why there is so much silence from the republican members of this body but it is not just young latino voters in chicago that are being motivated by republican attacks when republicans attack planned parenthood and block laws to guarantee equal pay for women that motivates women to register and vote when republicans celebrate people who will not issue marriage licenses to two men or two women a lot of people in the lgbt community get motivated to register and vote when republicans rail against unions and block increases in the minimum wage while of course they earn 174 000 a year and block environmental standards and block sensible gun laws a lot of working class and middle class americans

turned out to be bad influences made experimental choices his mother was aware of this sudden change and saw the signs of anxiety and depression brendan though got his ged started a job at 18 grateful

the successful commercialization of technology has expanded opportunities for those with stem degrees it is imperative that we promote women as part of this crucial expansion in order to promote equality in the advancing technological age a harvard business review article released last march described the top biases pushing women out of stem fields to women in any workplace this comes as no surprise the constant need to prove ourselves more times over than our male counterparts the tightrope of navigating a masculine workspace while holding true to our feminine identity and the general isolation of being a woman in a maledominated field are all too common in todays workplaces in my district wayne state university has a program called gogirl gaining optionsgirls investigate real life the mission of this program is to increase the competence and confidence of adolescent girls by engaging them in experiences that promote an interest in stem education while building their capacity to pursue stemrelated careers while programs like this are currently helping girls nationwide we must continue the progress that has been made and expand upon our success the promoting women in entrepreneurship act amends section 33 of the science and engineering equal opportunities act by including a key phrase that encourage its entrepreneurial programs to recruit and support women to extend their focus beyond the laboratory and into the commercial world the commercialization of stem fields has created a vast new sector of jobs and careers a sector that must include women professionals this act does just that ensuring the inclusion of women in one of americas most important and fast developing industries i would like to close by saying that i am proud of our chamber for coming together to ensure that women continue to achieve success in stem fields i also want to thank my colleagues for considering two bills today that highlight the importance of reaching out to

environmental groups with well over 100 million in annual revenues are using the law intended to protect the little guy to siphon money from the american taxpayers that is why my amendment is so important by closing this loophole we can uphold the intent of the law and ensure its continued efficacy furthermore line 15 of the stop settlement slush funds act contains a carveout for environmental litigation my amendment is therefore both germane and critical to preventing attorneys in these environmental lawsuits from using the currently existing loophole to charge upwards of 500 per hour for their service as my colleague representative huizenga has perviously pointed out every dollar spent on litigation is a dollar that cannot go to protecting or restoring the environment i also want to make clear that my amendment does nothing to prohibit groups from engaging in litigation or to prohibit repayments for their legal fees the 125 cap already exists in current law my

advice and let them make the decisions that affect their lives this is unprecedented it sets a precedent where those without any medical training can dictate medical practice and make choices for patients this definitely oversteps any legal bounds these are choices that should be made between doctors and patients congressional interference into how we practice is overreach it is a dramatic overreach and it is dangerous because it sets a dangerous legislative precedent what makes the healthcare delivery system in america so great is that it is accessible to folks and that we understand and protect the doctorpatient privilege that is at the very foundation of the oath we take when we enter the profession of medicine now the other bill that we are voting on today also dramatically restricts access if you think about the number of women in america who get their care from planned parenthood the preventive health services that planned parenthood provides is remarkable one in five women in this country have used a planned parenthood facility it is a remarkably effective way for women to get their health careand it is not just women many men also use planned parenthood we should be having the exact opposite debate we should be talking about how we can improve access to care how we can make sure every american has access to all of their reproductive options we should want to be talking about how we strengthen the doctorpatient relationship how we take the government out of the exam room how we leave some of the most intimate choices to the doctor and the patient again the oath that i took when i entered the profession was to sit with my patients answer their questions but then empower them to make the choices that fit their life circumstances that is what we should be
