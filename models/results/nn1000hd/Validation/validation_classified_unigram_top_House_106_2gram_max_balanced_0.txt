current plan fails to extend the life of social security by even one day it neglects the need for a medicare prescription drug benefit and hurts every american family in some way the republican leadership stifles common sense gun safety measures like child safety locks and background checks at gun shows despite the fact that 13 children are killed every single day by guns the republican

and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because it is the right thing to do so again i urge a yes vote i invite every democrat to join with republicans let us vote to eliminate the marriage

much as they want over 5 10 15 or 20 acres we should not do that in central park and we should not do it in the forestlands of washington where in fact that is going to go on if we accept that the problem with this bill is simple while america wants us to go forward on the environment this takes step by step backwards we should go forward on mining reform we go backward we should go forward on forest reform we go backward we should go forward on oil royalties we go backward my colleagues are right we did send this bill over to the other chamber but it came back infested with these antienvironment riders when we sent it over to the other chamber it was a puppy and it came back full of fleas and now those little fleas have got to be removed from this bill i want to tell my colleagues why i think americans are going to be so angry and i think angry is the right word for it when they hear about this continued giveaway it is because if you go on main street nothing will outrage the american people more than the giveaways to special interests the giveaways that this body has given time after time to special interest legislation and antienvironmental riders that should stop if we do not stand for the environment we ought to stand for this house for ourselves for each other when we voted 273 to say to the other chamber we will not let you shove this down our throats we will not let you go backwards on mining reform i do not want to encourage anyone to put up the white flag to the other chamber on this subject we ought to stand firm let me just point out when i say this is an abject retreat on mining reform it is i would encourage my colleagues to look at section 337 b which has some of the cleverest legal writing i have seen it is a little trick in here that says basically that congress agrees with the mining industry on their interpretation of existing law existing law there is a little time bomb in here that will entirely ruin our efforts now there is talk about compromise and i understand compromise in a legislative body but frankly compromise in this manner giving in to these special interests is like the guy who steals 10 from your pocket and wants to compromise by giving you five back that is the situation with mining reform i am simply saying this we are going to stand divided unfortunately on this some are going to stand for going forward on the environment and vote no some are going to stand with going backward on the environment and vote yes i am going to stand to go forward it does not matter how many more stands as far as i am concerned but the american people desire and are entitled to move forward when it comes to the environment"]]}
