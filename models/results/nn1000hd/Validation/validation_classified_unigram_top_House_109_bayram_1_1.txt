programs such as cops fire grants and byrne grants these programs provide rhode islands police and fire departments with the equipment and training to keep us safe how does this blueprint make us healthier the republican budget requires 20 billion in cuts to medicaid this reduction will jeopardize a critical health care safety net for seniors children and people with disabilities and shift more of the burden to states medicaid cuts would result in 80 million less for rhode island the loss of federal funding places an enormous burden on states like rhode island by pressuring them to cut

of the middleclass working families in america i salute him for his excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope

is that yankee ingenuity maybe it is that we are out here with that good old commonsense knowhow but we are always trying to do things faster better more efficiently more effectively and one of the

to stay competitive we know that as you look at policies creating the right environment so that job growth can take place so that economic growth can take place that when we see that right environment created then free enterprise and the private sector take over and they do what they do well the gentleman has shown us the charts which tell this story you go back and you look at 2003 and look at when those tax reforms were implemented and what we saw was an economy that took off what we are seeing is consistent economic growth every single month we are reaping the benefits from that we see that our gdp growth continues to be very consistent it was 4 1 percent last quarter there are some really wonderful benefits that come from this as the gentleman mentioned 4 460 000 new jobs those are new jobs many of those jobs are jobs that are basically in new sectors technology sectors sectors of the economy that will lead to an economic renaissance and lead to an economic renaissance in this country it works out to be 194 000 jobs a month that we have been creating over the past several months and i find it so interesting that the unemployment rate is near alltime lows when we look at the charts on that we see that as these tax reforms have been put in place and i applaud the senate i applaud the administration and i certainly applaud the leadership in this house for pushing forward

have talked so many times on this floor about there being two ways that we work through reducing the deficit and reducing the size of government and rightsizing the federal government and that is we reduce spending and continue to work to root out waste fraud and abuse focusing on that spending column but at the same time we put the focus on economic growth that is where our focus rightfully

portrays the overall budget projections the president claims that the steep budget cuts he advocates are necessary to cut the deficit in half in 5 years this is simply not true and the budget the president proposes fails to accomplish his stated goal first the budget is dishonest by omission nowhere in the fy06 budget does the president account for significant costs including fails to account

over 10 yearsyet still omits it in the budget fails to account for growth in interest costs fails to reform the alternative minimum tax that is disproportionately burdening middle income families in my district on long island as troubling as the glaring budget omissions is the knowledge that the deficit is largely a selfinflicted wound the president inherited a record annual surplus of 236 billionwhich now 4 years later has tanked into a deficit in excess of 400 billion any attempt at honest accounting suggests that we are looking at a decade or more of similar deficits the reason we are faced with an unethical budget is because the president refuses to acknowledge the fiscal irresponsibility of his choices and will not entertain even the most moderate suggestions such as repealing only the portion of the tax cuts that benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers unfortunately this budget builds on a disturbing trend this administration and the leadership in congress appear to be intent on valuing wealth over work thereby placing working families at a distinct disadvantage the tax policies the president advocates disproportionately advantage the wealthiest to the detriment of working americans and working families will continue to bear the brunt of the rising inflation spurred by the rising interest rates the bill gates of the world pocketed their tax cut at the insistence of the president however this president sees no problem eliminating funding for perkins loans in his budget even though the cost of tuition is rising and will continue to rise as the administrations policies force inflation as a result of the decision to eliminate perkins this year more than 670 000 student borrowers could lose out on loan forgiveness if they become teachers law enforcement officers or if they serve in the military this is just one of many examples of valuing wealth over work in my district the budget scales back and eliminates several longterm shore protection projects important to the safety and economic security of long island the president has no problem zeroing out the fire island to montauk point study just as it nears completion the

office from 7 million to less than 500 000 even though this is vital to the livelihoods and economy of the east end of long island the president falls far short of his promise under the no child left behind bill even though this means that taxpayers will have to foot the bill at the local level to pay for education finally the president does not seem to mind taxing veterans health care at 250 per year and doubling copayments for veterans prescription drugs at a time when we should be saluting our veterans our values as a society are not reflected in this budget we must ban together in congress

and done nothing now i have to admit he has not said they have done a heck of a job he has not used that language but he has failed to hold anybody accountable and one of the things that i am very pleased that you have been a leader on is holding the administration accountable for this is accountable for unitedstates tax dollars you know there was a democrat harry truman during world war ii who convened the truman commission in the unitedstates senate and he insisted that during war time even during war time it is important to notallow the abuse of unitedstates taxpayer dollars and he ferreted out some of the fraud and abuse in military contracting that was going on in world war ii even when our whole nation was in jeopardy in an existentialistic sense was in jeopardy but he still said we need to be careful with these dollars we have had umpteen billions of dollars disappear into the sands of iraq with nothing to show for it no meaningful reconstruction but tens of billions of dollars gone we have seen multiple gao reports inspector general reports we have seen multiple contractors many of whom have been very closely aligned with this administration there is no secret about that what we are saying as democrats is real simple the unitedstates congress needs to do its job to ferret out these abuses find the people responsible relieve them from duty and hold these contractors responsible to the american taxpayers that is not too much to ask this congress has been a lap dog it has been a seenoevil hearnoevil group while one of the greatest abuses of the american taxpayer ever happened in the sands of iraq despite the tragic loss which of course is a thousand times worse of our men and women in iraq so the democratic real plan for security is that it is the job of congress to hold the administration accountable to the american people and the american taxpayer and we will do that job at the right moment so i am glad that you have brought this issue up"]],

reality of what is happening in the 21st century i would be joining many of my colleagues in voting yes today but the bill we have before us is fatally flawed this rewrite is outdated unfair and unconstitutional i cannot support it in its current form this rewrite treats georgia as if nothing changed in the past 41 years in other words this rewrite seems based on the assumption that the voting rights act hasnt worked as a georgian who is proud of our tremendous progress and proud of our current record of equality i am here to report to my colleagues in the house that the voting rights act has worked in my state and now it is time to modernize the law to deal with the problems of today not yesteryear it is true when the voting rights act was first passed in 1965 georgia needed federal intervention to correct decades of discrimination now 41 years later georgias record on voter equality can stand up against any other state in the union today black georgians are registered to vote at higher percentages than white georgians and black georgians go to the polls in higher percentages than white georgians onethird of our statewide elected officials are african americans including our attorney general and the chief justice bf our supreme court plus african american representation in the state legislature closely mirrors their representation in georgias population but dont just take my word for it on georgias progress listen to this ringing endorsement from my colleague from georgia congressman john lewis an icon of the civil rights movement under oath in federal court 5 years ago congressman lewis testified there has been a transformation its a different state its a different political climate its a different political environment its altogether a different world we live in weve come a great distance its not just in georgia but in the american south i think people are preparing to lay down the burden of race if he said that under oath sworn to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth why is he telling the house something different today the reason he was under oath was because he was testifying in front of the department of justice that it was okay for the majorityminority districts in georgia to be diluted in direct violation of the voter rights act my other friend from georgia congressman scotr voted for that though it defies common sense this rewrite of the voting rights act gives no consideration to any changes that may have occurred since the first law was passed in 1965 the house is voting today to keep my state in the penalty box for 25 years based on the actions of the people who are now dead by the end of this renewal georgia will have been treated by federal law as a bad actor for 66 years to put that in perspective 66 years ago fdr was in his second term and the japanese were more than a year away from bombing pearl harbor by passing this rewrite of the voting rights act congress is declaring from on high that states with voting problems 40 years ago can simply never be forgiven that georgians must eternally wear the scarlet letter because of the actions of their grandparents and greatgrandparents we have repented and we have reformed and now as fannie lou hamer famously said i am sick and tired of being sick and tired lastly this renewal is unconstitutional in 1966 the supreme court of the united states ruled that section 5 of the voting rights act the section that singles out certain states for federal oversight was constitutional only because it was narrowly tailored to fix a specific problem and temporary you dont have to have a law school degree to know that this rewrite of the voting rights act fails both of those tests at 41 years we are already way past temporary and the application of section 5 is now arbitrary because this house cannot present evidence of extraordinary continuing statesponsored discrimination in the covered states that is different from the rest of the nation as such section 5 has served its purpose and is no longer an appropriate remedy in light of todays new voting problems the voting rights act represents a grand trophy of great accomplishment for congress but after 41 years the trophy needs dusting we could have given the trophy a new shine for a new century but sadly that didnt happen and still this bill

energy are charged with the administration of the energy star program which identifies and labels energyefficient technologies in a number of business and household products use of more energyefficient products enables residential and commercial energy consumers to lower their electricity costs and also to lessen the overall national demand for electricity h r 5646 would facilitate

to tell us like it is what is working what is not what we need to improve upon in regards to the policy of what is taking place but having gone to iraq now on three separate occasions i can honestly state that nothing has made me prouder to be an american than seeing our troops in uniform there performing their duties they are so welltrained so wellmotivated they are in short the best our nation has to offer yet their service to our country would be made much more difficult if they did not receive the support from back home first and foremost from their families and loved ones who also have to endure extreme sacrifice and hardship by allowing them to serve for extended periods of time overseas typically 1 year bootsontheground in theater like iraq today but there is another component to this another entity that oftentimes gets overlooked and that is what this resolution today speaks to it is the countless employers out there that have to by law a law that congress has passed allow them to serve our country while keeping their jobs open and safe back home it is one of those items that people tend not to think too much about but it does go to alleviate a lot of the concerns that our serving guard and reserve units have and that is maintaining financial security for the families back home and knowing that when they do return from serving our country there will be a position for them at their place of employment in wisconsin we have had two companies last year that were recognized for their outstanding service to the guard and reserve employees that they have one is

people who have been loyal to this country and have served for long distinguished careers now stand up and say about the management of this war as general newbold did on april 9th of this year he said

bombs trebled electricity supplies and oil production are still below prewar levels iraq stands on the threshold of a civil war now here is a leader in britain saying exactly what we are saying they have got troops on the ground they are committed in support but in fact they are becoming very antsy mr campbell comes up with a sixpoint plan to get out of iraq it is things that we have talked about right here in this room he talks about a comprehensive u n led disarmament demobilization and reintegration strategy as necessary to make a reality of the iraqi prime ministers policies that the militias must merge with the national security forces we all know this cannot be a government that has militias running it it becomes warlords it becomes like afghanistan it is the same thing he also says there needs to be an end to the systematic indefinite detentions by unitedstates and iraqi forces today there are 30 000 iraqis held in more or less permanent detention whether it be in guantanamo or abu ghraib or wherever and as long as we continue to do that we are occupiers there is no question about it and the plan which mr menzies campbell puts forward or the one that we put forward there are reasonable ways to get out of this but we must get out of iraq if we are ever going to deal with the problems you talk about in afghanistan we cannot fight on two fronts we have proven that we left afghanistan to go to iraq and the mess came right back up and if we are serious about dealing with whatever kind of terrorism was being created in afghanistan we have got to go back and finish that job now menzies campbell finishes by saying you could change the words a little bit but it would be the very same thing with distressing regularity the commons or the congress pays tribute to the brave men and women who have given their lives in iraq if the government cannot explain why this is necessary that they should make this ultimate sacrifice then it must be prepared to bring them home and that is where we are today we have a government that wants to get through 120 days and i will make a prediction for you right there the prime minister of iraq mr maliki is going

if he feared retribution from the government he replied im not afraid of them they are afraid of me once he became pope however his holiness was able to come to the aid of others fighting for freedom and human rights his support for the solidarity movement in poland and opposition to communists and dictators around the globe remade our world when he became pope in 1978 communism had a stranglehold on eastern europe and was on the march around the globe as pope he encouraged opposition movements and gave hope and guidance to millions in their struggle thanks in large part to his leadership in 2005 at the close of his papacy communism is confined to the dustbin of history and it is freedom that is on the march not only did pope john paul ii lead political change but he encouraged moral change as well in 1981 when a turk named mehmet ali agca shot the pope twice in an assassination attempt the pope later went to the cell of the man who tried to kill him and personally forgave him by both preaching and practicing forgiveness pope john paul ii demonstrated the enormous potential of human kindness in a time when many leaders look to the polls and test political winds for guidance pope john paul ii stood unflinching at the center of the most controversial moral debates of our time and held firm while always supporting the sanctity and dignity of human life his presence will be

resolution recognizing the valuable contribution of catholic schools last week marked the 32nd annual catholic schools week a week dedicated to honor the achievements and successes of catholic schools throughout the unitedstates more than 2 4 million children are enrolled in the 7 799 catholic schools in our country in addition 720 000 students are enrolled in the 212 catholic colleges and universities nationwide in my home state of new jersey 129 232 students are enrolled in catholic schools in fact new jersey has the sixth largest enrollment of students in catholic schools out of all 50 states of course children do not form their core values on the sole basis of what schools teach them learning a respect for life and respect for the rights of others is not the purview of schools alone it begins and is nurtured in the home accordingly the catholic school curriculum recognizes parents and family as primary educators and seeks to foster a shared vision between the school and family as the father of four children who have attended catholic schools i know that catholic school educators strive to work handinhand reinforcing family values ethical behavior social responsibility and academic achievement placing a premium on both academic standards and moral responsibility has proven to be a successful formula for catholic schools catholic secondary schools have a 99 percent graduation rate and moreover 97 percent of graduates continue their education learning in a religious setting is not for everyone and americas public school system is critical to providing educational opportunities for all we must continue to vigorously support our public schools at both the federal and local levels at the same time however we should support those who seek the benefits of catholic school and choose a religious setting as the best educational environment for their children the contribution of catholic schools to our nation extends beyond the classroom catholic elementary and secondary schools save the government and taxpayers of the u s up to 20 billion a year hi79 in effect parents of catholic school children pay twicethey pay their fair share of taxes necessary to support the public school system and they pay tuition at the school their children attend in order to address this issue i have introduced h r 441 the education achievement and opportunity act this bill provides refundable tax credits for the educational expenses incurred by parents for elementary and secondary school most significantly the tax credit is used for private school tuition however it can also be used for other educational needs such as computers tutoring or transportation fees thus parents sending their children to public school tcan also benefit from this legislation a catholic education challenges students through a combination of high standards strong motivation effective discipline and an emphasis on personal responsibility it is an education that goes beyond preparation for a secular life it is an education that prepares students for a christian life i ask that all members lend their support to h res 657 and pass it unanimously"],

poverty desperation and chaos its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit an emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist the democratic republic of the congo has seen more than its fair share of hunger poverty desperation and chaos since 1998 an estimated 4 milliofl people have died as a result of war famine and disease and thousands more die each and every day more than 40 000 women and children have been systematically raped and tortured at the hands of the armed forces of the congo perpetrators of genocide from neighboring rwanda and an increasing intricate array of militia groups life expectancy in congo has plummeted to 49 years and years of war and rampant corruption have decimated an economy that should

took place in july and october of this year an estimated 70 percent of eligible voters turned out to vote in the face of great difficulties and international monitors agreed that the election results were uncompromised by irregularities but the conduct of elections represent only an initial step towards normalcy a legitimate result in the october runoff that is accepted by both parties and the

particularly as we focus on other welldeserved crises such as that which is occurring in darfur and northern uganda and as a result of unitedstates policy towards congo really has gone adrift and needs to be reenergized s 2125 recognizes the importance of a coherent forwardleaning unitedstates policy toward the conto it identifies key unitedstates policies in congo including the promotion of free fair and democratic elections in the future support for security sector reform and disarmament demobilization repatriation reintegration and rehabilitation programs dnd the promotion of accountability for those who have committed atrocities and gross human rights violations it also asserts that the united states will work to ensure that a stable congolese government is committed to the principles of good governance and resource management rule of law and peaceful coexistence with its regional neighbors the bill suggests that the unitedstates partner with other governments with similar goals for the congo finally it compels the unitedstates to work to strengthen the mandate of the united nations peacekeeping force in the congo monuc to include specific authority to prevent and effectively counter imminent threats protect civilians enhance intelligence gathering capabilities and monitor arms trafficking and of course also to look into the terrible problem of child soldiers s 2125 further authorizes 52 million for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 an increase of 5 million to carry out these objectives and expresses support for additional funding in future years however the bill makes it clear that unitedstates assistance to congo cannot continue in perpetuity it dalls on the secretary of state to withhold such assistance if the government is not making sufficient progress towards accomplishing the stated unitedstates foreign policy goals this is a timely bill while providing a road map for unitedstates policy towards congo during this critical stage in its

look into the misrating of the grand theft auto video game i have been working on this issue for the last five years since 2000 and have been working also with representative wolf and others to ensure that members and the public understand the importance of this issue to our children its good to know that other members are becoming aware of the problem and together we can work in a bipartisan effort and make a difference through our hard work and that of those who are with us the esrb the voluntary industry rating board has now changed the rating of grand theft auto from an m to an ao that is not enough because there are literally dozens of games out there that have the same type of offensive content and the burden is now on the industry to explain why all of those games should not be rated ao also but we will not wait for the industry we must take action now we must step up the pressure for this reason we have asked the ftc to scrutinize all video games including grand theft auto to make sure they are properly rated we appreciate the continued expression of support by the congress together we can make a difference my legislation the software accuracy and fraud evaluation rating act or safe rating act would empower parents by calling upon the ftc to look at all video game ratings parents are the gatekeeper for what their children watch or play but how can they do that if the ratings are not accurate how can they do that if the ratings are confusing we must empower parents the decision to rate grand theft autosan andreas as adults only represents a small victory for those of us who have been calling on the video game industry to clean up its act however the industrys selfregulation is a case of the fox guarding the hen houseand american children are at risk because of this although the ratings board has decided in july of 2005 that san andreas should be rated adults only it has already been sold for at least 18 months earning millions of dollars for its producer in fact it was the bestselling game of 2004 and that means that millions of american children have played it being exposed to graphic violent and sexual content parents are confused by the ratings and angry that their kids are being exposed to filth and violence i hear from concerned parents in my district in california and from all over america h6404 co the most important step we should take now is to pursue an investigation by the federal trade commission into the video game rating system as my legislation calls for i have recently met with the ftc chairwoman deborah majoras to press for changes in how the games are reviewed and rated this is a 25 billion worldwide industry that makes much of its profits by targeting teenage and younger boys the industry can give a game an m rating with a wink because it knows that any kid can buy a game even if it has an m rating there are several problems with the m rating the wording on the label in the small print on the back of the package does not give parents a full and honest understanding of what is really in the game the m rating is confusing because the criteria that the industry uses to determine an m rating is almost identical to what it uses for the adults only rating kids are buying these games this month cbs news reported the results of a recent study despite the warning labels 50 percent of boys age 714 have bought a game ratedm for mature audiences and a stunning nine out of ten of the boys have played them these games are harmful to children playing a violent or graphic video game hurts a child even more than watching a violent movie or tv show or listening to an obscene song because the child is role playing the child assumes the identity of a criminal or a gang member too many video games glorify and reward violent and criminal behavior why dont the video games feature heroic characters instead of having a child aca like a copkiller why not make him a police officer instead of someone who kills why not make him a lifesaver like a fireman or a doctor its time that the video game industry acted responsibly its time to take a hard look at their ratings we must support this legislation on the floor today and i urge all members to give their full support to my bill h r 1145 to have the ftc look at the ratings of all video games"]]}
