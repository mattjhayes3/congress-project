we deal with the problems particularly on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year"], [0.0294644832611084, 0.9705355167388916, 1, "i first want to start by thanking congresswoman beatty for that very kind and generous introduction we in our class are very proud of our colleagues and we support each other in times of need i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries the gentleman from new york who is also host of this special order i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions to get the security you and your family deserve and to get the health care that we all need"], [0.04354149103164673, 0.9564585089683533,

gentleman from new jersey who is right across the hudson river and who so ably serves the communities of newark and beyond this evening we have heard from so many distinguished members of the congressional black caucus most recently from the gentlewoman from texas with whom i serve on the judiciary committee about the importance of the moment in time in which we find ourselves right now related to not just the confederate battle flag but perhaps more importantly what is the legacy that we want to have as americans as members of congress in dealing with the complicated issue of race it is an honor and a privilege to once again have the chance to come to the house floor to have this conversation this is a most distinguished venue from which to speak to the american people an appropriate one i would add given the houses constitutional relationship to the people of america this of course being the only institution that was envisioned by the founding fathers as one in which the people serving in the institution would be directly elected by the people the senates members of course in its original constitutional version were elected by the state legislature then of course the presidency to this day is a vehicle through which the individual is selected by the electoral college so this is the peoples house the institution most intimately connected to the people of america and the place where we should be able to speak truth to power we witnessed that last week as we were forced unfortunately to discuss the issue of the confederate battle flag at a moment when people of all racesdemocrats and republicans blacks whites the extraordinary leadership from the governor of south carolina and the distinguished gentleman from south carolina jim clyburncame together at the moment when the confederate battle flag was coming down in south carolina there were members of this house trying to lift it up it was quite unfortunate that we needed to detour from this moment that we were having in america led in south carolina to address the battle flag issue on this house floor but i am hopeful that as we move forward now in a more productive way we can begin to confront some of the public policy challenges that we face in america that supporters of the confederate battle flag have fought against as others have detailed during the presentation here today the battle flag which met its initial defeat in 1865 at the end of the civil war remained largely dormant in american history until 1954 in the supreme courts decision of brown vs board of education it was decided that this facade of separate and equal was constitutionally suspect and that african americans were being denied the opportunity of being educated in quality public schools in the deep south and in other places in america really it was in the midfifties and then into the early sixties when the confederate battle flag was resurrected as a symbol of the segregationists who were fighting to uphold jim crow it was a symbol of those who were fighting to stop the efforts of courageous individuals like congressman john lewis who in 1965 was the cochair of the student nonviolent coordinating committee it was a symbol of those who were trying to fight efforts by john lewis and others to make sure that the franchisethe right to votewas colorblind in nature and that the 15th amendment could actually be brought to life all throughout america and in the deep south where there were those who were trying to prevent african americans from being able to vote the battle flag was resurrected in the fifties and in the sixties to stop certain things from happening it seems to me that rather than having the discussion about whether it should come down no reasonable person can take the position that it should have a place of honor so it is extraordinary to me that we had to take to the house floor last week and have to come to the house floor today to continue to address this issue hopefully reason will prevail over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of dayseven prior to the august recessand we can move beyond the confederate battle flag issue and address some important substantive issues that many would argue remain as part of the legacy of the confederacy we dont want to see the ghosts of the confederacy invading the united states congress from a policy perspective those nine soulsgodfearing churchgoing african americanswho were killed simply because of the color of their skin died because of someone who charged into that church with the intention of sparking a race war that was inspired in part by the confederate battle flag one of the things that has happened as a result of that tragedy is the battle flag has come down but that is just the beginning of the work that we need to do in response to that tragedy and the conditions that so many people find themselves in all across america as has been mentioned we have got to confront the gun violence issue that we have in the united states how can it be that we have 5 percent of the worlds population but 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that we have more than 285 million guns in circulation nobody can give you an exact estimate because a chokehold has been placed around the federal agencies charged with preventing gun violence and dealing with gun safety in america it is an incredible act of legislative malpractice but it is estimated that we have got over 285 million guns in america isnt it reasonable particularly in the aftermath of this tragedy in charleston south carolina that we come together and figure out a way to prevent those guns consistent with the second amendment from falling into the hands of individuals who would do us harm it seems to me to be a reasonable thing that we can do as americans it also seems important that we would find a way 50 years after the passage of the 1965 voting rights act to stop trying to prevent americans from exercising their sacred franchise and participating in american democracy yet something happened in the aftermath of 2008 a real interesting moment in november of that year that seemed to have shocked a whole lot of people across this country as a result 2 years later when there was a midterm election subsequent to that there was an outbreak with this concern of voter fraud fabricated because no one can point to any evidence of an epidemic of voter fraud not a scintilla of evidence has been presented anywhere in this country that we have got a problem that needs to be addressed but we have had all of these voter suppression laws enacted that are consistent with the ghosts of the confederacy and what those folks stood for who were waving the confederate battle flag in opposition to the changes of the fifties and sixties what shocks me is that even the supreme court has gotten into the act by decimating the section 5 preclearance through claiming that section 4 is outdated and this house refuses to act on fixing the voting rights act i would argue thatagain consistent with our democracy and the spirit of coming togetherthat perhaps that is one of the things we can address so that we can take down on the one hand the divisive symbol of hatredthe confederate battle flagfrom here in this capitol and in whatever form it hangs all across america so that we can lift up

pollution and more of these types of health hazards it favors polluting industries at the expense of americans and air quality moreover the bill sets a very dangerous precedent that could open the

and selling the body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america

air station in montgomery county and mr fitzpatrick of bucks county in warminster the navy has been working very closely with the epa and the public water authorities to take wells off line to address

our judgment the jcpoa deserves congressional support and the opportunity to show that it can work we firmly believe that the most effective way to protect unitedstates national security and that of our allies and friends is to ensure that toughminded diplomacy has a chance to succeed before considering other more risky alternatives that is the diplomats the generals and admirals wrote there is no better option to prevent an iranian nuclear weapon if the iranians cheat our advanced technology intelligence and the inspections will reveal it and unitedstates military options remain on the table and if the deal is rejected by america the iranians could have a nuclear weapon within a year the choice is that stark twentynine of our nations most prominent nuclear scientists and engineers wrote we consider that the joint comprehensive plan of action the united states and its partners negotiated with iran will advance the cause of peace and security in the middle east and can serve as a

distinguished colleague from california said indeed they would be more likely to blame us for walking away from a credible solution to one of the worlds greatest security threats and would continue to reengage with iran he went on to say instead of toughening the sanctions the decision by congress to unilaterally reject the deal will end a decade of isolation of iran and put the united states at odds with the rest of the world we certainly dont want to do that today something very interesting happened it was a statement put forth by u k prime minister david cameron french president francois hollande and german chancellor angela merkel they wrote an oped for the washington post and said this is an important moment it is a crucial opportunity at a time of heightened global uncertainty to show what diplomacy can achieve this is not an agreement based on trust or any assumption about how iran may look in 10 or 15 years it is based on detailed tightly written controls that are verifiable and longlasting they went on to say we condemn in no uncertain terms that iran does not recognize the existence of the state of israel and the unacceptable language that irans leaders use about israel israels security matters are and will remain our key interests too we would not have reached the nuclear deal with iran if we did not think that it removed a threat to the region and the nonproliferation regime as a whole we are confident that the agreement provides the foundation for resolving a conflict on irans nuclear program permanently this is why we now want to embark on the full implementation of the joint comprehensive plan of action once all national procedures are complete our own president wrote to congressman jerry nadler i believe that jcpoa which cuts off every pathway iran could have to a nuclear weapon and creates the must robust verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program is a very good deal for the united states for the state of

while women are most at risk we must remember that this disease does not just affect women while less common in the united states 2 350 men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the past 20 years there have been incredible advances in the research and medicine surrounding breast cancer but there is much left to be done we cant rest until we can prevent or cure this horrible disease again we have already made huge strides in the fight against breast cancer death rates due to breast cancer have been declining since 1989 and women younger than 50 are now less likely to get breast cancer

receiving mammograms and for women without health insurance the percentage is even higher with 68 percent not receiving mammograms it is extremely important that we continue to place an emphasis on early detection so that we can catch this disease as early as possible and have the best shot at beating it while there are factors like genetics and age that can make someone more susceptible to the

bipartisan bill but it also speaks volumes that amtrak has performed so well without additional revenue this bill leaves amtrak at about level funding just a tiny bit more when we call amtrak americas railroad that is not a metaphor all of its stock is owned by the department of transportation the reason for that is that the private sector in the 1970s found running a railroad to be a moneylosing proposition and asked the federal government to take over amtrak amtrak of course is a fiction it is structured as a private company but like every railroad in the world it is either subsidized by the government or the public cannot afford to ride the bill has almost no new funding but even without new funding amtrak has already scored great points amtrak has essentially overseen the revival of train travel in the united states of america and it has done so in a way that the government can take almost no credit for for example ticket revenue was 1 5 billion in 2005 then we go 5 years later to 2010 it is 1 8 billion and today it is 2 1 billion yet the average ticket has increased only 5 every 5 years over that period of time amtrak knows what the market is about and it has grown based on volume not revenue the railroad has seen phenomenal growth in passengers reaching records as high as its highest record in 1988 when the equipment was much newer an important measure of efficiency is simply the number of seats filled more amtrak seats are filled today than at any time its ontime performance is above 80 percent and that is amazing when you consider that amtrak does not own most of
