future im happy to say that several members of this body have joined me in this call of support for our children the families and children of america are suffering and we cannot rescue one without saving the other as a noted child advocate has said and i quote it a community values its children it must cherish their parents my colleagues the care and nurturing of our families and children must become a national priority it is no longer acceptable to pay lip service to this issue not when 22 percent of all childrenmore than 1 out of 5live in poverty as a woman of color i cannot in good conscience keep silent when i know that more than half of those children 55 percent to be exactare africanamerican or hispanic in this land where the american dream still looms large as the one thing for which we should all strive there are people who toll at hardlabor every day of the week and only to find themselves still below the poverty level almost 12 percent of the families in this rich nation of ours make up the working poor and again for families of color the figure doubles to over 25 percent members of the house it is meanspirited and disgraceful that we continue to allow these conditions to exist there are those members in this body who would vote against any initiatives to help families and children while at the same time professing a deep love and devotion to our nation and this democracy to those members i say this is a shortsighted and hypocritical way to do business if you want to prove your allegiance to america then do it by standing up for those who will lead her into the 21 century members of the conference committee will have the opportunity to do that over the next few days as the budget reconciliation bill takes shape the measure that was approved by the house held four provisions that would put both our children and our families first those programs are childhood immunization earned income tax credit the mickey leland hunger program and the family preservation and support program i ask the members of the house for their continued support for these programs lets start with the immunization program dont let anybody tell you that parents can get their children immunized if they simply would make the effort to do it the numbers dont support that myth right now the rate of immunization against deadly childhood diseases in this country is a measly 55 percent how can we look ourselves in the mirror and say its ok for 55 000 children to be crippled or killed by a preventable disease like measles it happened in 1991 and will most certainly happen again how can we simply stand by and allow polio mumps rubella and meningitis to take this terrible toll on our children i submit to you that we cannot and before you tell yourself that the vaccines are available to everyone so we really dont need to do anything about this problem let me quickly tell you that the cost of immunizing a child jumped from 11 in 1977 to 133 in 1992 its called an economic deterrent many low and middleincome families who lack health insurance simply cant afford the service included in the house reconciliation legislation is a universal vaccine assurance system which would serve 11 1 million children who are now currently uninsured or underinsured medicaideligible or native american in north carolina 290 000 children would receive vaccinations 116 000 more than are currently eligible under medicaid i argue that providing vaccines for children is not only the morally right thing to do it is also fiscally sound let me remind my colleagues that 1 spent on immunizations now saves at least 10 in treatment down the road to sum it up briefly we can pay the bill now or pay it later the choice is ours with the issue of hunger i make the same plea we can provide children with the proper nutrition to grow strong bodies and healthy minds now or pay the consequences later the mickey leland food stamp provisions are critical to addressing the grievous problem of hunger the nationwide community childhood hunger identification project released in 1991 reported that 5 5 million american children under age 12 are hungry this means 1 out of every 12 furthermore an additional 6 million children find themselves in families that are at risk of hunger because sometimes these families in order to pay their utility bills in the winter can not afford to buy food these figures are astonishing in light of the abundance that we find in american agriculture onehalf of the recipients of food stamp benefits are children while 80 percent of the benefits in the program go to families with children put simply the food stamp program is the frontline of defense for preventing hunger in america over 96 percent of the benefits go to people at or below the poverty line most58 percentgo to households that are so poor that their income does not exceed half of the poverty line we must not accept hunger as a standard in this country the mickey leland provisions of the reconciliation bill speak to the problem of hunger by providing basic subsistence to those who are in desperate need i deeply urge my colleagues to support the efforts of individuals like the late mickey leland who died while attempting to address the deplorable conditions faced by the hungry on the african continent after we have fed our children and provided for their health we must help empower their working parents to lift themselves out of poverty that is the goal of the earned income tax credit program currently about 5 million americans work 40hour weeks and still remain below the poverty line it is a disgrace that individuals in america can work full time and never rise out of poverty in the house reconciliation bill families with two or more children that earn up to 8 500 a yearwhat fulltime minimum wage work now pays would receive a wage supplement to bring them to the poverty line i believe that an expanded eitc is essential to reward work and pave the way for welfare reform further the eitc would be of great benefit to low and moderate income working families in north carolina some 485 000 working families with children in north carolina received the fjtc in 1992 the expanded eitc program in the house passed reconciliation bill would have ensured that those workers with families and childless workers were brought up to the poverty line this is especially important in light of the increasing tax burden on the poor without an expanded eitc program which includes childless workers we will be taxing those poorest among us deeper into poverty i urge all members to show their support for this program especially to the finance committee of the senate and the ways and means committee of the house to work for its inclusion in the conference report finally i ask that my colleagues on the conference committee pay special attention to the family preservation and supportprovision contained in the housepassed reconciliation legislation last year 2 9 million children an average of about 8 000 a day were reported abused and neglected more than three children a day died of maltreatment the 1 5 billion included in the house package would help prevent this neglect and abuse and possibly offset more expansive social service programs by providing funds for family support programs that teach parents early how to protect nurture and support their children the funding will help states develop and expand programs for families in crisis to help keep children and parents together and will improve the quality of foster care for those children who cannot be protected at home the senate did not include the family preservation and support program in its version of the budget reconciliation legislation it is my sincerest hope that my house colleagues will prevail with the house provisions today we have the opportunity to tell the world that america values its children and families above all other things that we respect the sanctity of the family unit and will do all we can to support and encourage families to stay together and work for their goals with a vote for the initiatives i have

the rest of the world seems to be moving together the iron curtain has fallen as has the berlin wall jews and arabs in the middle east are coming together and whites and blacks in south africa are moving toward peace and democracy although as we have heard in recent weeks there will be setbacks along the way but even with the efforts for peace and reunification these are turbulent times in

easy reunification is not an easy way but it is in the end the only way just a few short months ago prospects for peace in ireland were not strong but today after the issuance of the joint declaration of peace by prime ministers reynolds and major in december and developments over the last few months i think most observers find themselves thinking positively about the situation in northern ireland we have a chance now to move forward toward a united ireland prime minister major said yesterday in referring to the violence in northern ireland that strong support for peace coming from america can play a part in this i guess we should add tonight that strong support for unity coming from britain can also play a major part in this i for one pledge my support for the principle of peace in northern ireland and for making at long last ireland a free and united 32county ireland clearly the irish people overwhelmingly support efforts for peace they are tired of the violence the american people and the american political leadership here in the congress and in the administration should be as well it is time for all parties to the dispute to sit down and work out an accord and whatever steps we can take as americans to accomplish this noble goal should be taken just as we have across the globe eight hundred years of conflict 25 years of increasing violence more than 3 500 lives lost women children infants the frail and elderly countless innocent bystanders have been brutally and violently murdered it is time to make it stop there is no easy solution but the first steps toward unity are a willingness to negotiate whether you are from britain or northern ireland or the republic whether you are a unionist a republican or a nationalist put aside your differences clear your

address those problems in terms of needed investment i would like to introduce that by observing that at the turn of the last century the parisian born italian economist vilfredo pareto recognized in his field for the contribution he made in applying mathematics in economic theory earned his greatest reputation not for that contribution but for his magnum opus mind and society an extraordinary work in sociology perhaps the most impressive lesson of that 4volume work was his devastating delineation of the strong component of the nonrational in all our institutions not only did he identify the rrational in economic institutions but in the activities of government as well looking at the present state of affairs here and abroad i think that both economists and those involved in government would agree that the situation has not changed much in the hundred years that have passed professional economists tend to work strictly within the limits of their own specific scientific discipline we as legislators must measure an issue by many criteria sometimes involving several fields of science frequently without being expert in any we come to our job with certain preconceptions as to what government can and should accomplish that the preconceptions of officeholders have no necessary connection with scientific validity was demonstrated by former president reagan on more than one occasion during his 8 years in office someone has defined politics as the art of the possible but often to judge by the pace of results it might be redefined as the art of making the possible impossible certainly there would be some justification for so characterizing the budget debate of 13 which saw laudable goals for reinvestment whittled down to insignificance on november 5 in the business section of the new york times there was an article announcing market plunge threatens yearlong rally i will quote from two paragraphs that were of particular interest to me the first problem for the traders and investors in the last several weeks has been the fear of risin economic growth without looking at longerterm trends traders and investors often instinctively interpret growth as a threat of rising inflation which erodes the fixed returns in the bond market that fear has increased with reports showing stronger growth in the third quarter and auto sales data indicating more growth in the fourth quarter there is nothing unusual in finding this kind of statement in a business publication it is a description of the marketplace at work as seen by investors and traders somehow or other however it has a disturbing quality in that it seems to imply that investors and traders are afraid of economic growth i am referring to the words traders often instinctively interpret growth as a threat of rising inflation which erodes the fixed returns in the bond market this is an over simplification of their position of course and they would say that what they are

you kidding me are you kidding me about what you are saying on the floor today we are going to vote on a balancedbudget amendment and you are telling me we cannot cut 1 percent it is not a cut a slowdown in the increase by 1 percent to pay for people who have been hit in an earthquake man somebody is not getting the message about what they are saying out across this country they want us to act like a family make some choices i mean you would think we were cutting this budget by 50 percent we are talking about less than a 1percent reduction in the increase in federal spending to pay for

happy and honored to be here to talk about a need that is so pressing in america now and that is the need for health care reform but before we radically reform the health care system i think we ought to consider what the system in the united states is all about and what some of the competing systems are offering our people we have a myth and there are several one is that there is 65 or 66 million uninsured americans in california there are many uninsured californians but no one has denied service when you get through with medicare medicaid medical you are going to special programs like county hospitals and clinics everyone receives care but is it cost effective and is it right for the consumer as well as the taxpayer there are many uninsured but the taxpayer is picking up the freight and when we get through here in washington redesigning the medical system you are going to find the same thing is true most of us will be insured there will be some that will be supported totally by the government we have another myth and that is the myth of affordable health care by providing a single payer or government plan will somehow make it morecost effective and let me just describe a few ways that the government is planning to do that so that people can go into this health care reform with their eyes open critics of unitedstates health systems point to the success that other countries have had with national health insurance they insist that americans could have affordable health care too if only the unitedstates government would adopt national health insurance however the evidence clearly shows that countries with national health insurance have not actually made health care more affordable in the sense of providing services more efficiently instead doctors and hospitals provide less expensive services or fewer services in order to keep total costs within the limits set by not the marketplace or the need but set by the governments and government budgets each year under the british national health care system 9 000 kidney patients are denied renal dialysis or a kidney transplant 10 000 to 15 000cancer patients are denied chemotherapy 4 000 to 17 000 patients each year are denied coronary artery surgery creating more problems and more severe problems later on four hundred and fifty to one thousand children are denied total perinatal nutritional therapy seven thousand elderly are denied hip replacements mainly because of their age while 1 million people wait for surgery 1 in 4 hospital beds is empty while another bed is being used by a chronically ill patient in lieu of a nursing home as this table indicates both canada and germany lag behind the united states in the availability of modern medical technology open heart surgery in canada 1 25 persons per million are able to avail themselves of open heart surgery in germany 0 74 in the united states 3 26 catheterization to open the veins 1 5 in canada 2 64 in germany 5 06 per million in the united states in other words if we restrict the availability of medical services we can save money bit if that is your mother or your child do you think that is costeffective the answer is no there are a whole list of services where the united states is on top the perpetrators of the fraud that we need a government health care system have told us the reason we need it is because 16 percent of our gross domestic product is being used for medical services that is true and 20 years ago only 12 percent was used for medical services of gross domestic product that is true that also is true why is that because today we are living to be 85 rather than 75 and most of the health care costs come in the last 5 years of our lives what the government is telling us is be patriotic the governor put it simply do your patriotic duty die that is not a compassionate view that is not a view of quality medicine that is not a view the republicans want to offer as an alternative to the existing health care system according to one report because of physicians adjustment to fee scales that have not kept pace with inflation patients in canada and japan must make multiple visits to receive the same services previously provided in a single visit in fact they make 12 visits a year 4 times the amount that the average american makes because the doctors are limited in how much they can charge so they have them coning back constantly this is not efficiency it is another way to milk the government i dont think it is a good way as another report notes national health insurance works in other countries for three reasons first the wealthy powerful and sophisticated find ways to maneuver around the system and do not take advantage of it at all and get around rationing second those pushed to the end of the line are generally unaware of medical technologies that they are being denied therefore in germany where they receive less they do not know that it is available third there are no or severely limited contingency fees no generally recognized right of due process no cadre of lawyers such as we have in the united states willing to represent those who are discriminated against let me close by just giving the members one last thought to chew on while the debate on national health insurance and the governments role in that health insurance is being debated here in 1960 government subsidies accounted for 25 percent of total health care spending by 1990 the governments share was 53 percent we are still able to choose our doctors we still have the finest health care system in the world according to the last study about 95 percent of all hospital bills and more than 80 percent of physicians fees are paid by private and public third parties on an average every time a patient spends a dollar in the medical marketplace 76 cents is paid by someone else what does that do to the demand if you do not know you are paying for it or if you do not feel you are paying for it you overuse the system what happens when there are too many lawsuits and people are pressing for malpractice the doctor defends himself by overtesting we drive the cost up by government involvement we drive the cost up because of the legal system we drive the cost up because insurance companies are ofttimes unwilling to insure because they might be sued doctors do not do charity work because they are afraid they will be sued yes we can make this system better but let us do it through the marketplace let us expand on the 80 percent that are already happy with their insurance and are insured let us not throw the 80 percent out to chase the 20 percent i thank the gentleman from california mr dooli=e for yielding me the time and i look forward to working with him as we reform positively not

eastern atlantic continue to flaunt the most basic iccat guidelines exceeding target harvest levels and catching millions of undersized fish in addition many other countries that are not members of iccat also harvest bluefin in violation of iccat recommendations last month a national academy of sciences panel concluded that this onesided conservation program will not rebuild bluefin stocks it also found that previously reported declines in the abundance of bluefin in the western atlantic were not supported by the scientific data and that further quota reductions could not be justified the united states has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the recovery of atlantic bluefin now it is time for other nations to do the same the results of the national academy review confirm this this resolution directs the united states to encourage all nations harvesting bluefin to adopt bluefin conservation programs comparable to the unitedstates program it also states that the united states should not even consider further quota reductions until foreign fishermen have done their fair share the current iccat program for bluefin which focuses conservation efforts strictly in the western atlantic where only 12 percent of the bluefin harvest occurs is unfair to unitedstates fishermen and will not restore bluefin stocks instead all nations must play by the same rules it is time
