modifications to fund various popular programs but as time passes all the defects and shortcomings of the bill in spite of the efforts of the subcommittee to try to rationalize its actions serious problems are very apparent in this bill i would just point out the serious shortfall in terms of funding for housing based on obviously cooked numbers apparently from the committees and from the committee on the budget and arguable numbers from the administration some of which i agree and disagree with within this bill there is 945m nearly 1 billion dollars less than in 1999 for housing it is like the house is participating in a continued sham in terms of the budget act the fact of the matter is that the public is rejecting the policy path that has been laid out by the congress but the majority insists on getting up and passing bills that seriously underfund programs and seriously underfund housing this is almost a billion dollars less than what was actually funded last year based on trying to use standardized numbers several billion dollars less than the administration has requested i would say looking at what the need is that the serious problems of the past have now turned into a crisis with regards to housing we cannot continue to use housing as the honey pot to take money out and spread it around to programs that have more popular support in my community in minnesota we have about a 1 percent vacancy rate in fact vouchers that are often provided as an answer very often do not work and will not work so even though all the facts change all the circumstances change the congress acts as if in 1999 is still on a 1997 budget rationale funds are being split off for various purposes here for an 800b in tax breaks for pentagon spending for other matters and yet we do not respond to the various and the deep needs of the low income people in our communities and their housing crisis the homeless funds are cut lead paint abatement funding cut community development housing funds those of the least powerful in our society are shortchanged i urge my colleagues to reject this bill i hope we could get to work and be in reality rather than remain in a state of denial regard the needs of people for shelter in safe sanitary housing once again the gop leadership is relying upon gimmicks to hide their fiscal year 2000 appropriations process train wreck by turning their backs on funding needs for important people programs and failing to invest in important social housing and community development programs the republicans have all but ensured a major confrontation this fall with congressional democrats and the administration the rush to provide tax cuts for special interests and the wealthy have clouded the need to address social program funding realities unfortunately the vahud appropriation bill started out on a sour note with the republican budget blueprint earlier this year adding salt to the wounds the gop majority appropriators chose to lay out unrealistic laborhhseducation 302 b allocations in order to spare from reductions popular defense spending military pork projects and nasa programs all of these increases are provided at the extreme cost of housing and development programs and environmental protection such irresponsible gop policies will put in place a convoluted process of shifting money into popular programs to attract votes and comply with the spending caps at the expense of the powerless in our society sadly this vahud bill continues to force hud to draw the short straw for housing and community development programs and that will impact real people through the loss of jobs and affordable housing there are few improvements to mention though i am pleased that there is finally some commitment to restore 10 million in funding to the fema emergency food and shelter program a program that i have worked with chairman walsh in the past to increase funding however the bill we will vote upon this week continues the theme of the past few years making housing a principal wellspring for spending increases elsewhere and tax cuts for special interests and the wealthy hud estimates that in minnesota we will lose over 23 million jeopardizing 1 600 jobs and almost 2 400 units of housing for lowincome families if this bill were enacted the cuts in hopwa housing for persons with aids and mckinney homeless assistance funds would result in 138 homeless and persons with aids not being served the st paul public housing authority one of the nations best accurately explains the consequence further cuts in public housing funds will jeopardize our safe affordable and quality public housing because cuts in operating subsidies will slow responses to repairs cut key staff who screen applicants and generally impair their ability to apply for and comply with federal programs the lack of commitment and cuts that this vahud bill would deliver will result in fewer resident services and will mean less ability to deter criminal activity and other community concerns unfortunately the vahud appropriations bill cuts close to a billion dollars in funds from huds budget last year and is some 3 billion below the administrations request despite trying to hide the cuts by spreading the pain around it is clear that housing and community development will suffer under this billan atrophy by design this atrophy has also hit successful programs like the neighborhood reinvestment corporation which faces a 10 million cut in this bill further while the overall vahud bill has lost some of the emergency spending gimmicks the gop majority appropriators have chosen instead to gouge ever deeper in the laborhhseducation funds in order to spare the popular veterans and nasa programs predictably housing and community programs have been left with cuts to the community development block grant cdbg and even the mckinney homeless assistance programs housing for persons with aids public housing and the list goes on no new housing assistance despite the commitments to authorize 100 000 new vouchers made in the 1999 budget authorization this is a warped policy especially at a time when millions of people are on waiting lists for housing are on the streets and according to a department of housing study deems 5 3 million families have worst case housing needs this situation is frankly dire the circumstances and facts change the federal budget is in better shape but lowincome housing needs have exploded yet the funding response ignores the facts the real need of our communities which should be addressed by this bill is in preserving our federally assisted housing from the optout or prepayment phenomenon by matching state programs to keep buildings affordable or marking up market rents so landlords stay with our successful programs but how will we be able to move forward for the future with preservation efforts when this bill does not squarely address the real housing needs of this country with what we have now we are already sliding backward and the passage of the vahud bill this week is like throwing a drowning person an anvil this is not acceptable policy for housing our people or creating the economic opportunities that will help them move forward in tandem with their communities and neighborhoods this appropriation process and budget blueprint is wholly inadequate if we are going to cut spending it must be based on equal sharing of the burden not loading all the cuts on the backs of lowincome americans and the programs which serve them certainly this policy path and bill should be rejected to add insult to injury this spending measure makes no effort to reconcile the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars of rescinded section 8 moneys that have been usurped for emergency spending this year and the last this year for example we lost 350 million in section 8 that is made up if at all on the backs of other critical housing programs like the cdbg block grant which serves low and moderateincome folks in cities across the country while the committee may claim inadequate appropriation authority under the budget the fact is that there are 215 earmarks spending money on special interest projects the conclusion of this bill is to deny funding for housing and other needs but to buy off votes to pass it with projects and earmarked funds i am concerned regarding the cut in funding for the community development financial institutions cdfi fund as the sponsor of the bill to maintain and improve the cdfi fund which has been reported by the banking committee i think it would be more appropriate to keep the funding for the program at 95 million instead of what the committee provided through this bill a reduction of 25 million this underfunding is even more serious if we are to be able to have the running room to adequately fund the prime program that the banking committee has also reported out"], [0.12182988226413727,

security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty once and for all let us make the elimination of the

to black history and appreciate tremendously these members who have joined me on the floor of the house to acknowledge this very special month i am thrilled to stand here on the house floor as an american and as an africanamerican member of congress in the 211 years of congressional history there have been only 105 africanamerican members of congress 101 africanamericans have been elected to the house of representatives and only 4 have been elected to the senate i am boldly able to stand here today because other courageous and brave africanamerican pioneers stood valiantly before me during black history week but most importantly throughout the year i am reminded of the legendary achievements that have paved the way for my colleagues and i this year marks the first black history month celebration of the 21st century appropriately the association for the study of african american life and history has labeled heritage and horizon the african american legacy and contributions of the 21st century as the theme for this years celebration i think you will agree africanamericans have played an integral part in the development and prosperity of our nation tonight i would like my remarks to reflect the rich legacy of the africanamerican experience and its relationship to american history seventyfour years ago a bold and daring scholar had a vision to honor the legacy of africanamericans as you know this legendary scholar carter g woodson founded what was then called black history week now our nation celebrates the entire month of february as black history month and if i might quote my 14yearold son jason lee we should not be regulated even by a month for african american history is a history of a people and the history of america so i would hope that as we take to the floor of the house on the last day of this month my colleagues will join me in additional days in which we will spend talking about african american history and i would hope that we would begin to explain to the american people how intimately woven this history is with america as we recall africanamerican history we should not be afraid to say that it is american history and we should not be afraid to recount it over and over again not out of hatred or hatefulness but out of the need to educate and to allow this country to move forward and to build upon the richness of its diversity and to solve some of the very problems that we confront today africanamerican history is rightfully recounting the contributions of great americans americans who dared to change not only their individual community but also their surrounding nation as i recall the legacy of africanamericans i remember the brave and bold leaders of our past there is no shortage of articulate influential africanamerican leaders in our nations history these individuals influenced both the africanamerican community and our society at large in powerful ways as they fought to win freedom fair treatment and better lives for all of america for example brave men like nat turner gabriel prosser and denmark vesey who organized and led doomed but valiant slave rebellions against brutal slave owners abolitionists like frederick douglas and sojourner truth who undermined the institution of slavery by speaking writing and lobbying against itat considerable personal risk and brave individuals like harriet tubman who risked her life and her hardwon freedom to return to slaveholding states to lead other africanamericans north to freedom along the underground railroad and the civil war where over 200 000 africanamerican men fought in the union army and navyto free their enslaved brethren and prove that africanamericans too were committed to democracy and the preservation of america and in the early 1900s africanamericans like booker t washington w e b dubois and mary church terrell shaped attitudes within the africanamerican community and won the respect of all americans across the country also marcus garvey led what was labeled the black nationalist movement and fought institutional racism in the united states in the 1920s 30s and 40s a philip randolph worked to organize africanamerican workers and end the division of the labor movement along racial lines he also worked diligently to end discrimination in the military and the government and after world war ii africanamerican leaders like charles hamilton houston william henry hastie a leon higginbotham jr thurgood marshall martin luther king adam clayton powell jr and malcolm x made significant marks on american historyin our courts our schools our government our politics and in foreign affairs africanamerican women like fannie lou hamer shirley chisholm and barbara jordan one of my personal heroes broke old barriers and won the respect of millions of americans for integrity their intelligence their dedication and their professional accomplishments this recitation of africanamerican leaders is by no means allinclusive in fact it touches upon only a few of the vast amount of africanamerican leaders who have shaped this countrys history and added to the legacy of africanamerican accomplishments in america i mention these names to merely observe the fact that africanamericans have always played an integral part in the history of the united states as part of this annual observation of black history month it is vital to remind america that in the face of racism discrimination and violence many africanamericans have changed the very fabric of this nation i would like to stress that all of america can draw great satisfaction and strength from this history it is important because as we embrace this history it provides not only inspiration for africanamericans but also all of america on the dawn of the 21st century i believe that we must speak about africanamerican history throughout the year because there are still many barriers that america has yet to hurdle and face at the dawn of the 21st century america has not accepted in a collective and collaborative fashion that african american history is a history of america issues that impact our communities such as increased funding for nutrition programs affirmative action the voters rights act reparations for africanamericans racial profiling equitable funding for historically black college and universities equitable training and funds to children for access to the intemet and a multitude of other critical issues are concerns that americans must join together and combat if america embraces african american history as american history we would go so much further in solving these problems and many other critical problems in closing i strongly feel that all americans must have a better understanding of each other our rich diversity has been at the same time the reason for our continued struggles and progress we must leam each others history africanamerican history must be the kind of history that is living that is accepted that is widespread and that all people can understand this great nation must embrace this rich history of the past and the present and use it as a~guide for reshaping americas future"],

copy of an editorial which appeared recently in the kansas city star i would like to read some excerpts of that editorial because as far as i am concerned they got the debate exactly right i read and i quote in 1996 congress ordered the administration to simplify the pricing of milk that is easy enough stop regulating it but this is the farm sector and a free market in milk is somehow inconceivable instead milk prices are calculated from rules and equations filling several volumes of the code of federal regulations the administrations proposed reform would reduce the number of regions for which the price of wholesale milk is regulated from 33 to 11 fine but it would also perpetuate the loopy depressionera notion that the price of milk should in some respects be based in part on its distance from eau claire wisconsin under current policy producers farther away from this supposed heart of the dairy region generally receive higher premiums or differentials the administration called for slightly lower differentials for beverage milk in many regions but in congress even this minuscule step towards rationality is being swept aside the committee on agriculture has substituted a measure that essentially maintains a status quo similar moves are afoot in the senate worse some dairy supporters are working to reauthorize and expand the northeast interstate dairy compact a regional milk cartel and allow similar grouping for southern states missouris legislature by the way has already voted to join the southern compact even though it would result in higher prices for consumers the consumer federation of america reports that the northeast dairy compact raised retail milk prices by an average of 15 cents a gallon over 2 years dairy producers concerned about the long view should be worried critics point out that the higher milk differentials endorsed by the house committee on agriculture may well lead to lower revenue for many producers this is because the higher prices will encourage more production driving down the base milk price and negating the higher differential the worst idea in this developing stew is the prospect for dairycompact proliferation a compact works like an internal tariff because the cartel prohibits sales above an agreedupon floor price producers within the region are protected from wouldbe outside competitors opponents point out that more regional compacts and the higher prices they support will breed excessive production creating dairy surpluses that will be dumped into markets of other regions this will prompt other states to demand similar protection promoting the spread of dairy compacts ultimately as in the 1980s political pressure will build to liquidate the dairy surplus in a huge multibillion dollar buyout of cheese milk powder and even entire herds congress should permit the northeast compact to sunset or expire which will occur if the lawmakers simply do nothing in fact doing nothing to the administrations proposal seems to be the best choice in this case or more properly the least bad perhaps some day washington will debate real price simplification as in ditching dairy socialism and letting prices fluctuate according to the law of supply and demand closed quote the kansas city star is right we should allow secretary glickmans modest reforms to go forward we should sunset the

dust in the mines were unhealthy we also knew atmospheric fallout was dangerous these brave people the uranium miners millers and transporters and the downwinders were used as atomic guinea pigs the united states owes a debt of gratitude to the workers and their families who unknowingly sacrificed their health to help win the cold war i have listened to many of these victims who have bravely fought their cancers and the unitedstates government for justice the senate bill addresses some not all concerns with the current reca program mr hatchs bill revises reca in the following ways includes residents of areas where atmospheric nuclear testing was conducted streamlines current payments schedules by requiring the government to pay compensation to eligible victims within six weeks authorizes a grant program to provide for the early detection prevention and education of diseases caused by radiation exposure expands coverage to include uranium millers in addition to miners expands current criteria for victims of radiation exposure to include a wider variety of covered cancers although i support these improvements the bill i introduced in the house last year would have done much more to provide justice for the victims of radiationinduced diseases the bill we are voting on today must be accepted or rejected in total without any amendments as the judiciary committee stated at their markup of the bill reca is a work in progress therefore in order to ensure immediate and badly needed improvements in the reca program i support the senate bill however we all agree and recognize that improvements need to be made to the radiation exposure compensation act i am especially concerned that uranium workers employed between 1971 to 1990 are not covered under this bill nor under current law and that the level of compensation remains at 100 000 my bill would have increased compensation to 200 000 which more fairly covers the medical expenses hardships and lost income to the victims my bill also contained provisions to address victims of experiments who were exposed to radiation without their consent and would have shifted the burden of proof off the victims onto the government other changes in my bill would have removed the smoking distinction and included workers exposed after 1971 especially important was the requirement to take into consideration and incorporate to the fullest extend feasible the compensation claims process for navajo claimants to conform to navajo law tradition and customs for example claims should be based on traditional ties of family one of the champions in this fight was a man by the name of paul hicks he passed away recently and is unable to be with us and witness this victory i also want to thank the navajo nation

bipartisan bill aimed at giving greater flexibility to local schools to do their job the important job they do of educating our children during the past couple of months i have visited 10 or 12 schools in my district and visited the school districts there to sort of find out what they think of the federal role in education the federal role in education usually accounts for about 4 to 8 percent of the budgets of the average school district and i wanted to know if they thought that was helping the answer i got back was yes the money helps but there is too much red tape and there is too much regulation they want greater freedom so that they can exercise their skills and use the teachers and principals and parents and everybody involved in education on the local level there is too much federal red tape and the education flexibility act would target that red tape right now we have a pilot project that allows some 12 states in the country to take advantage of education flexibility this bill would expand it to all 50 states and what it would do is give local school districts the ability to get waivers from those federal regulations but the important thing about education flexibility is that it combines flexibility with accountability which is the way it ought to be done you can get the waiver the local school districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that we go further than the education flexibility act right now there is far too much red tape and far too many regulations in hundreds of different areas generated from the federal government that does not really help our local schools but only ties them in knots i do not want the people working in the schools in my community to spend all of their time filling out forms and justifying their existence to the federal government i want them to be educating the children there and doing the job that really matters right now far too often they are filling out the forms and trying to qualify for the money and continually justifying what they axe doing we need to change that we need to shift to local control from one end of this country to the other exciting things are going on in states and school districts they are making the reforms necessary they are moving towards accountability and right now the federal government is too big of a noose stopping them from making progress on that we need to make changes like the education flexibility act as a democrat i have always been a strong supporter of education and i support my fellow democrats in supporting spending the money necessary to help with education and supporting public education public education is responsible for over 90 percent of the children in this country getting educated it needs our support but we cannot simply spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best how to do it we need to make those changes so that we can have the world class public education system we need the education flexibility act that we introduce this week as i mentioned primarily sponsored by the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from delaware is a critical step i urge all of my colleagues to support edflex pass it as soon as possible and then go further to encourage the flexibility and accountability that we need in our local schools"],

let me say from the start that i very much appreciate the cooperation of the gentleman from new jersey and his staff for working with the minority in shaping this legislation i do not oppose the minor changes that have been made in the bill since it was reported by the committee on resources certainly the bill falls short of what i think could be done to strengthen and protect the coastal barrier resources system nonetheless i believe we have effectively eliminated the most problematic provisions to arrive at a fair consensus and i urge members of this body to support the bill this legislation would reauthorize the coastal barrier resources act when congress passed the coastal barriers act in 1982 it declared that the purpose of the act was to and i quote minimize loss of life wasteful expenditure of federal revenues and the damage to fish wildlife and other natural resources associated with coastal barriers by restricting future federal expenditures and financial assistance which have the effect of encouraging development of coastal barriers this innovative policy has made good sense since 1982 and it continues to make good sense even today hurricane floyd as we have recently seen again demonstrates the wisdom and benefits of discouraging development in some of the most dangerous hazardprone coastal areas of our nation most importantly this legislation will begin the long overdue process of modernizing coastal barrier resource system maps section 5 of this bill would direct the secretary of the interior to conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility and costs of creating a digitized series of coastal barrier maps current maps were prepared in the 1980s by using primarily color infrared aerial photography and unitedstates geological survey quadrangle sheets handrendered delineations of coastal barriers were drawn upon these sheets in order to produce the inventory of coastal barrier maps however major technological advancements such as the new digital spatial data global positioning systems computerized geographic information systems and the new cartographic and survey methods make far greater detail and accuracy now possible it is essential for the fish and wildlife service to investigate how these new information systems and mapping technologies might enhance the accuracy usability and transferability of existing coastal barrier maps we will be looking for the fish and wildlife service to expedite completion of this pilot study as soon as possible i am however disappointed that we were not able to consider more creative ways to increase the amount of undeveloped coastal barriers in the system and i suspect that the congress will have to revisit this matter at a later time this legislation does authorize the voluntary donation of private property for inclusion in the system however it remains doubtful that any significant tracts of additional private land will be forthcoming in the absence of any new inducements to encourage donations nevertheless we encourage the fish and wildlife service to pursue aggressively opportunities for donations should they become available i am also compelled to express my sense of concern with the inability of the fish and wildlife service to complete and submit to the congress a study of undeveloped coastal barriers along the pacific coast the secretary of the interior was directed in 1990 under section 6 of the coastal barrier improvement act to prepare and submit a study which examines the need for protecting undeveloped coastal barriers along the pacific coast south of 49 degrees north latitude through inclusion in the system the secretary of the interior was also directed to prepare maps identifying the boundaries of those undeveloped coastal barriers of the united states bordering the pacific ocean south of 49 degrees north latitude all deliverables were to be provided to the congress not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of the 1990 law well the fish and wildlife service has failed to provide congress with either a final report or the maps this 8year delay is plainly unacceptable i am greatly concerned that the pace and growth of the new developments along the pacific coast may have significantly reduced the number of coastal areas that meet the section 31 definition of undeveloped coastal barrier i urge the fish and wildlife service to complete this directive as soon as possible finally i would be remiss if i did not restate the minoritys longstanding concern with the majoritys decision to include three other separate technical correction bills as section 6 7 and 8 in this reauthorization bill these provisions would change existing boundaries for three different otherwise protected areas in florida north carolina and delaware bills of this type are complicated certainly they are not technical corrections in the traditional sense all of the proposed boundary changes tacked on to this bill deserve close

appropriate scrutiny yet even today we are still awaiting additional information from the fish and wildlife service concerning the boundaries of a coastal barrier unit adjacent to the cape hatteras national seashore it is my understanding from the chairman that we will continue to work in good faith to resolve issues concerning this final boundary consequently we have agreed to move forward with this reauthorization bill at this time however should this boundary issue not be resolved to our satisfaction we do reserve our right to reconsider support of this legislation in conference should the

i rise as a proud supporter of this resolution which commemorates the 10year anniversary of one of the most astounding historical events of the 20th century the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of communism throughout central europe what started out as a trickle solidaritys victories in poland during june of 1989 hungary opening up its border with austria later that summer led to a deluge of east germans flooding across the berlin wall and a few weeks after that the velvet revolution in czechoslovakia took place and no one could predict these events and no one knew how to react to these events one of my most cherished possessions that i still keep here in washington with me on my desk is this chunk of the berlin wall it still has graffiti painted on it coincidentally it is shaped like the state of wisconsin but it is a chunk that i personally whacked out of the berlin wall on october 3 1990 during the reunification celebration when i was over there as a student traveling throughout central europe this came at a crucial time in my life as a third year law student i was watching these historical events unfold with rapt attention like the rest of the world was but i was feeling a little bit disillusioned and a little bit cynical about our own political process here in this country so i decided a few months after the revolution had taken place to travel through central europe to visit the european capitals live out of a backpack survive on cheese and bread during that time and see firsthand these remarkable changes taking place i met when i was traveling through there the real heroes in my mind of the revolutions and the changes that took place they were students such as myself about my age who had literally on the front lines of the demonstrations literally looking down the barrel of communist guns and facing soviet tanks not knowing whether they were going to succeed or whether this was going to turn into a massacre they knew their countries individual histories 1968 prague spring 1956 hungary when the communist authorities did in fact crack down and as history later showed during the velvet revolution the politburo voted 5 to 4 not to use force to bring down the demonstrations one vote could have made all the difference in prague during that fall of i asked many of these students what they remembered most about those demonstrations and the events and they said two things how terribly cold it was as they were maintaining candlelight vigils all night long and the fear that they felt again not knowing whether or not the military was going to open fire on them but perhaps the most important wall that fell in that region to make this all possible was not even visible it was the wall of fear that fell and we cannot overestimate the role that fear does play in any totalitarian or authoritarian regime to keep them in power but this was made possible because mikhail gorbachev as the gentleman from california already indicated changed the dynamics in the region by denouncing the use of force in order to keep communist governments in power by pursuing his policies of glasnost and perestroika the general opening of information and ideas in these regions it diminished the fear and empowered people to have the courage to demand change perhaps it is the greatest magnificent irony that one of the most oppressive communist regimes in that area czechoslovakia would later be led by former poets and playwrights vaclav havel the first democratically elected president in czechoslovakia was a former playwright himself the first democratically elected president since masaryk and edvard benes just before the second world war he was the founder of charter 77 the moral blueprint for change in the area and also founded the civic forum that gave the people in czechoslovakia the political alternative to the communist regime but not before he was imprisoned on four separate occasions in fact during one of those imprisonments he was on his deathbed literally the communist authorities did not want a martyr on their hands so they went to him and said listen the people who give out the obie award will allow you to direct your own play in new york and get proper medical attention and he said i just have one question if i go will you allow me back in and they could not give that assurance and so he refused the rest as we say is now history but in conclusion i just want to pay a special tribute and wish a special happy 10year anniversary to those students who really were on the front lines and showed through their courage that there are causes and ideals greater than ones self that are worth risking everything for so on this day my thoughts and my memories go to many of those students who i personally had a chance to meet and who inspired me to get involved in public service when i did return to the united states"], [0.7277557253837585, 0.27224427461624146, 1, "i yield

time i am rising in support of this resolution although i do it with great reluctance because it is always difficult not to give the benefit of the doubt to the executive in foreign policy but 7 weeks ago i voted against authorizing unitedstates intervention in yugoslavia because i could discern no national interest in taking sides in a civil war no approach that would lead to a diminution of violence and no credible exit strategy i would like to stress above all one thing historical analogies are extremely difficult to derive i personally believe there are a whole lot that apply in the balkans but many of them are contradictory one that the majority side in support of the war falls back on is the holocaust i believe that there are holocaustal analogies but i also believe that milosevic is a sui generis war criminal one for whom holocaustal acts are not unknown but one where leadership is more analogous to say a ho chi minh or possibly even a pol pot than to a hitler i raise this because if we exclusively make hitlerite analogies we have no choice whatsoever than to follow a kind strategy that could lead in and of itself to greater losses of life to innocents than a negotiated settlement with each decision it appears that this administration and nato are moving into a circumstance where the problems are more difficult not less more likely to lead to outrageously violent results now is the time to stress negotiations the time to recognize that we are not likely to have a great victory senator alken once suggested in vietnam in the late 1960s that we should declare victory and get out that prescription does not fit the balkans but i would urge that we put in place a process of negotiations and with that process recognize we have a greater chance for a successful resolution than any other possibility little is more difficult than to apply perspective to the events of the day the administrations kosovo policy is open to question from two contrasting perspectives should we militarily engage the government of yugoslavia and if so what form should this engagement take the first question involves fundamental constitutional issues on war powers and the role of congress in legitimizing military action and enhancing the participation of the american people in decisions related to war and peace the second involves the unchallenged role of the president as commanderinchief and doctrines of warfare seven weeks ago i voted against authorizing unitedstates intervention in yugoslavia because i could discern no national interest in taking sides in a civil war in the balkans no approach that would lead to a diminution of violence and no credible exit strategy the administration through its acts and statements has broken with the military doctrine of the last several administrations particularly the reaganite reliance on peacetime military preparedness and the bush espousal of the powell doctrine which calls for the establishment and enunciation of clear objectives with the use of overwhelming force to achieve these objectives in this context i recently reviewed a 1984 speech of the former secretary of defense casper weinberger weinberger suggested that six major tests should be applied when we are weighing the use of unitedstates combat forces abroad 1 first the united states should not commit forces to combat overseas unless the particular engagement or occasion is deemed vital to our national interest or that of our allies 2 second if we decide it is necessary to put combat troops into a given situation we should do so wholeheartedly and with the clear intention of winning if we are unwilling to commit the forces or resources necessary to achieve our objectives we should not commit them at all 3 third if we do decide to commit forces to combat overseas we should have clearly defined political and military objectives and we should know precisely how our forces can accomplish those clearly defined objectives and we should have and send the forces needed to do just that as clausewitz wrote no one starts a waror rather no one in his senses ought to do sowithout first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it 4 fourth the relationship between our objectives and the forces we have committedtheir size composition and dispositionmust be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary conditions and objectives invariably change during the course of a conflict when they do change then so must our combat requirements we must continuously keep as a beacon light before us the basic questions is this conflict in our national interest does our national interest require us to fight to use force of arms if the answers are yes then we must win if the answers are no then we should not be in combat 5 fifth before the unitedstates commits combat forces abroad there must be some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the american people and their elected representatives in congress 6 finally the commitment of unitedstates forces to combat should be a last resort americans are obligated to assess whether unitedstates policy in kosovo today meet the above tests in terms of implementation the grenada interventionas minor an issue as it may have been and the gulf war which involved far greater geoeconomic stakes than the kosovo conflict stand in stark contrast with the new clinton military doctrine which can be described as 1 reliance on aircraft and missiles to rain destruction from thousands of feet and in some cases hundreds of miles in such farflung parts of the globe as east africa afghanistan and now serbia from an american perspective this use of air power is starwars like but from the perspective of targeted populations such as in belgrade the effect bears more resemblance to the bombings of world war i1 2 the declared renunciation of the use of ground troops amounts to the articulation that the united states intends to engage in kosovo with one hand tied behind its back 1 3 the determination that murderous potentates should be held in check through the destruction of significant civilian as well as military targets including electric utilities water systems political headquarters tv stations and residencies of heads of states 4 the use of a defensive alliance for intervention in a civil war 5 placing the prestige and might of the united states on the line through the commitment of air power while multilateralizing the decisionmaking and control in the nato structure which functions by consensus the lessons of history have been widely invoked both to justify and to decry our military intervention in kosovo unfortunately history does not provide easy answers either with regard to the meaning of contemporary events or to what actions should be taken in response to them for instance in the wake of world war i historians and political scientists rightly concluded the european system had been too inflexible in 1914 a misapplication of this lesson however led a generation later to munich too much rigidity precipitated the first world war too little backbone encouraged hitlers aggression in the second world war ii involved a conflagration between nation states it also involved a conflagration withinthe holocaustand challenged civilized society not to allow a replication of such inhumanity to man the background of both world wars bears on american decisionmaking today clearly the onslaught against the ethnic albanians in kosovo that milosevic has unleashed has holocaust parallels on the other hand the ethnic cleansing the serbs have undertaken also has analogs with what croats bosnians and to a much lesser extent kosovars have attempted in the region milosevics barbarity would appear to lie somewhere between ho chi minhs assault on south vietnamese catholics and pol pots attempt to exterminate intellectuals the problem with equating milosevic exclusively with hitler instead of recognizing him as a sui generis war criminal is that it makes a negotiated settlement morally untenable and renders it impossible for the unitedstates to consider anything less than unconditional victory this is particularly dangerous when it is selfevident that a negotiated settlement is preferable to all sides over a protracted conflict hence it is key to understand that at this point kosovo is more a civil war with holocaustal elements than viceversa but if the war continues a complicating factor for maintaining nato unity in the face of serbian atrocities will in all likelihood be the wests ability to stomach kosovar countermeasures and the implications of ratcheting up air power the line between a terrorist and a nationalist freedom fighter is narrow as is the line between using force to stand up to atrocity and applying force in such a way that greater violence is precipitated yet another lesson of history regards the effectiveness of air power and strategic bombing as john kenneth galbraith who led a team that assessed the impact of allied air power in world war ii has noted bombing in coordination with the use of ground troops has generally proved effective but strategic bombing of cities often causes populaces to rally to domestic leadership no matter how malevolent here it must be noted that air power is different from what it was earlier in the century our arsenal now includes nuclear weapons of enormous destructive power as well as socalled smart bombs and missiles that can strike with surgical accuracy which greatly enhances our ability to limit danger to our armed forces and collateral damage to civilian areas the development of smart weapons however may have caused political leaders to be too tempted to use them without recognizing that the use of force anywhere at any time has ramifications which are not easily predictable and which not infrequently are counterproductive for instance our goal in using force against milosevic may be to undermine his political support but it would appear that to date we have ensconced his political strength while weakening the democracy movement which was profoundly proamerican in serbia and damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary serbs much of the world is not enamored of americas ability to rain destruction from afar we simply have no idea how deep and how long the effects of our air strikes and the targets we have chosen will last what we do know is that serbs point to a 14th century defeat as a rallying cry for their actions today what we do know is that the armenians believe that in 1919 they suffered the first holocaust of the century and turkish embassies to this day are susceptible to terrorist attacks because of the atrocities of the now defunct ottoman empire in the background of the predicament we are in is failed diplomacy where theodore roosevelt invoked a doctrine of speak softly but carry a big stick this administration has propounded a policy of threatening vigorously while refusing to make timely military deployments that might have averted conflict we have been backed into using air power not out of considerations of national interest but to ensure that the credibility of unitedstates political leadership was kept in tact we told milosevic we would use it if he did not agree to our preferred negotiating plan and he in effect called our hand in the background was a peace agreement which had the doubtful support of one side and no support from the more powerful party while the rambouillet accord might have met standards of american sensibility it clearly proved untenable for the activist parties in the region this fact should give pause to nato america in particular in this regard i have become increasingly frostian in my geopolitics good fences sometimes make good or at least better neighbors it would appear that despite the multiheritage example of sarajevo the people of the balkans will have to learn to live apart without war before they can live together in peace a century and threequarters ago an american president james monroe asserted a doctrine that carries his name which established that the united states would object to further european colonization in this hemisphere and give succor to independence movements in latin america implicit in the monroe doctrine was the assumption growing from the concerns of our first president george washington a military man that the united states should not become entangled in the quarrels of europe with the exception of two world wars in this century and a commitment made in the context of the cold war of a defensive alliance historical unitedstates foreign policy has been govemed by the precept that we would give umbrella protection to independence movements in the americas but refrain from military intervention in the internal affairs of nation states on the continent our country was formed by dissidents and opportunity seekers reacting to the repression and civil wars in europe it now appears that our fore fathers better understood the balkans and like european problems than the state department does today at this point we are being asked to support nato action for the sake of the viability and credibility of the alliance rather than for the purposes for which the alliance was formed we appear to be putting the alliance ahead of our objectives and allowing our mutual strategy to test the alliance itself which it is doing one poll has found that 95 percent of greeks object to the nato bombing of yugoslavia and there are significant percentages albeit smaller opposed in every country of the alliance including the united states a decade or so ago i participated in a forum at the library of congress with former secretary of state henry kissinger at which i asked him about an observation he made in one of his autobiographical works kissinger had written that between the 1968 election and the inauguration he had sat down with presidentelect nixon and the two of them had decided to get the united states out of vietnam i asked why they had not just gone ahead and done that immediately upon taking office and kissinger responded congressman we meant we would get out with honor asked if that meant further escalation of troop numbers and bombing kissinger responded absolutely it is my sense that nato is in a similar position today with regard to belgrade for the honor of nato it appears that we are about to escalate the war the question is whether we are not better off seeking the earliest possible settlement history is a source of lessons and perspecfives but issues of the moment must also be approached in a manner which calculates their future implications natos strategic rationale appears to have broken down on the issue of numbers there are 19 states versus one with that one being much smaller than most of the 19 but another way of looking at this strategic conundrum is that 19 countries are allied against the forces of nationalism and subnationalism in a part of the world where historical and ethnic tensions provide little basis for compromise nationalism led to dramatic changes in the worlds map in the 19th century and has been repeatedly underestimated as a force in the 20th century the question is will nato despite its might find itself in the same position in the balkans as the united states did in vietnam and as the soviet union did in afghanistan returning to history the first great chronicle of the western world relates to a land mass adjoining the balkans ancient greece thucydides wrote that early in the peloponnesian wars which pitted the quasidemocratic and enormously uplifting culture of ancient athens against the more militaristic sparta the athenian assembly voted to send a navalfleet to conquer the neutral island of melos several days later the decision was reconsidered and a faster ship was sent to overtake the fleet and call off the invasion later in the war however the athenian assembly again decided to invade melos and sent out a force which killed all the men and enslaved the women on the island thucydides chronicles were intended to show how the worlds most civilized citystate at the time had lost its way and indeed from that point on athens never again recovered its prior status an aspect of the bombing today is what targets are left in serbia after so much damage has already been inflicted clearly at this point the serbs have lost virtually everything except the war while the west has won nothing particularly a peace a case can be made that whatever mistakes have been made to date it is morally questionable to stand by and do nothing and an even greater mistake to pull the rug out from under the executive branch the reason i cannot support americas continuing military role is that each of the choices for nato in the future gets more untenable there is the prospect of sending in troops with losses potentially equivalent to or greater than vietnam there is also the prospect of ratcheting up the air war one can always strike again at military sites but it appears that on the civilian side yugoslavia has already been bombed back to the 18th century military historians counsel two principles when devising strategic doctrine put on the shoes of opponents and do not back them hopelessly into a comer in the case of kosovo we clearly have not put on the shoei of the serbs and we have done everything to back milosevic into a comer we have made a martyr out of a murderer and allowed a war criminal to stand up to nato which includes serbias ancient enemy turkey milosevics martyrdom increases with each degree of the suffering of his people every society has an historian or philosopher who points out that the road to hell is paved with good intentions despite the good intentions of the west our policies appear to be counterproductive ratcheting up the war could well signify a ratchetingdown of the moral high ground of nato the prerequisite of policy must always be good intentions but good intentions are insufficient grounds for action policy must match intentions with practical capacities to carry out defined objectives just war doctrines after all require that responses be proportional and effective the only alternatives to a bombs only policy are the introduction of ground troops or the isolation of serbia the reliance on a humanitarian response to a humanitarian crisis in either case the legal and moral imperative to indict serb leadership for war crimes is overwhelming in the late 1960s senator aiken suggested we simply declare victory and get out of vietnam this prescription does not fit todays dilemma in the balkans but our first obligation should be to put in place a process of negotiations with the understanding that an imperfectly negotiated settlement may be the closest thing to victory that is likely to be possible without the loss of an incalculable number of innocents escalating the war on the other hand puts unitedstates interests at risk in the balkans and in other parts of the world the earlier we reconsider the better the vote on this resolution and the others we will take today are necessitated by law that law the war powers resolution may be unconstitutional and todays votes may serve as a basis for the courts to rule to this effect nonetheless the war powers resolution is at this moment the law of the land ironically we are finding compliance may be more difficult for the legislative than as has generally been perceived for the executive branch because it forces congressional accountability for or against executive actions more importantly the timing as well as the fact of consideration of these resolutions is awkward for the national interest because legislative decisionmaking is required by dates certain i e within a prescribed period from the time troops are deployed in hostile circumstances the public interest may not be well served by such a review of executive action in such a timeframe but it would be less well served i congress avoided its legal and constitutional responsibilities hence what in effect is a legislative executive confrontation is legally at this time unavoidable and as an individual member of congress i have no option except to take a stand this stand is one of dissent to what i consider to be a
