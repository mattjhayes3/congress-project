bipartisan way let me outline for my colleague here the process that we went through on the clinton bill in the committee on education and labor we had 29 hearings we had 8 weeks of markup we had 4 weeks of markup in subcommittee this is where members can propose amendments we discussed them we debated them and then we voted on them we then had another 4 weeks of markup in full committee in full

is a good way to legislate nine new bills and 8 days to finish the work no time to go back to our constituents some of our colleagues here earlier tonight are saying now that we have the bills we can learn them we can read them and understand then and talk to our constituents about them the question is when are we going to go through that process there is a better process today i went to the

even something that may only have 218 votes is the law of the land but the version that has the most votes becomes the law of the land i do not know whether that will be the process that we go through

subcommittee for his continuous efforts to bring this bill to the floor today i am particularly pleased that section 209 of the bill incorporates much of my legislation to establish a heritage area in vancouver wa and i would say to some of the people across the aisle that it is supported by the chamber of commerce supported by the downtown business groups supported by the citizen groups it has broadsupport in the area vancouver which is located just across the columbia river from portland or was at the center of the settlement and development of the northwest daring the 19th and early 20th centuries in a single 360acre area are five historic assets that chronicle the history of the northwest from the regions exploration by lewis and clark between 1805 and 1806 to the rise of american aviation in its golden agebetween the first and second world wars for the past 3 years i have been working with the mayor of vancouver the park service and many others to establish a fedealstatelocal partnership to preserve restore and coordinate the management of the historic area in vancouver working together this partnership crafted a proposal which is reflected in my bill and section 209 of h r 5044 to manage the assets protect the historic resources and encourage visitors to come to vancouver to learn about the compelling history of the pacific northwest in 1990 congress adopted my legislation to establish a commission to analyze various management options for these historic properties the commission was composed of representatives of the major entities interested in the area including the national park service the army corps of engineers the city of vancouver and the state of washington the commission completed its work in april 1993 by recommending that a partnership be established to ensure effective coordinated management of the area the members of the commission agreed that management of the area needed to be coordinated by a federally established management framework based on partnership between the interested government entities to implement the recommendations of the commission i introduced h r 4687 to protect all of the key areas and the equally significant historic periods and events they represent most importantly by unifying and coordinating the management of all these historical assets the bill proposes a partnership to develop the full educational recreational and historical potential of the area it is no secret that resolution of the pearson airpark controversywhat the appropriate role of the airport should be after 2002 is crucial to an overall cooperative management agreement for the area while there is now an appreciation that persons aviation history is of national significance and should be preserved there has been disagreement over whether it should remain an operating general aviation airport my own view is that it would be unconscionable to eliminate the aviation history represented by pearson airpark and its young but flourishing aviation museum i am also convinced that some general aviation activity at pearson is necessary to help underwrite the costs of haintaining the airfield which is essential to the historic aviation mission both my legislation and the bill before us today follow the recommendation of the commission that general aviation continue through the years 2022 beyond that time it would take an act of congress to allow general aviation to continuea decision left to another generation h r 5044 is about partnership its about local groups coming together to protect american heritage its about the federal government working costeffectively with state and local groups but most importantly its about protecting our nations history so that it can be enjoyed and appreciated by future

nothing unless you believe that the ending of the cold war and the development of the new world order signal a reevaluation of the relationship between guam and the federal government nothing unless you believe that the relationship should be a partnership between guam and the united states nothing unless you believe that the citizens of guam should have the right to determine how they should be governed guam is currently an unincorporated territory an unincorporated territory means that first laws can be imposed upon the people of guam without consultation second any local law can be

mutual interests of both parties this new partnership will not affect guams role as a strategic outpost of the military in the western pacific the federal government should and will maintain defense authority in guam if commonwealth status is successful the only difference is that under commonwealth there will be an enhanced sensitivity to guams land needs and planning h r 1521 recognizes guams strategic role and continued reliance upon the united states for its defense and the act acknowledges that defense and foreign affairs are unique federal responsibilities some of you might ask why are

stability and control over its status some of you might ask why commonweath status why not statehood why not independence why not free association the voters of guam have made that determination in january 1982 two plebiscites were conducted to give the voters of guam the chance to choose the future political direction of guam the options included status quo statehood incorporation commonwealth independence and free association in the first plebiscite 49 percent of those voting chose the commonwealth option 26 percent chose statehood 10 percent chose keeping the status quo only 5 percent of the voters selected incorporated status while 4 percent opted for independence and 4 percent opted for free association independence later that year a runoff plebiscite was held between statehood and commonwealth choices this vote attracted over 81 percent of the voters an overwhelming 73 percent of these voters supported commonwealth status the voters chose commonwealth status it is believed because it was considered to be the most pragmatic and attainable of the options thus the philosophy of the commonwealth act is to structure a better relationship with the united states a relationship tailored to meet the unique circumstances that exist on guam a relationship tailored to meet the growing aspirations of the people of guam for greater seifsufficlency a relationship tailored to

century in joining my colleague i also want to heartily commend him once again for faking this time that we may speak about this very disturbing chapter in world history it is a story that is widely known however there is little mention of it in our history books for while it may be painful to review these events as long as this is the case as long as we experience this discomfort and painthere is hope for humanity unfortunately the plight of the armenians and the attempted genocide of 1915 by the ottoman turks is an event that the unitedstates government has still not recognized in a time where human rights are in the forefront of all of our minds we mustrecognize the struggles that the armenians have gone through in 1915 as well as 1993 with the azerbaijan blockade the holocaust museum opening here in washington dc will remind all of us of theunspeakable horrors that the jewish people of nazi germany had undergone i believe that this museum will send a very important and powerful message reminding all of us that human rights violations can take place at any time and any place to any group of people and that this cannot be tolerated anywhere indeed in few other instances has mans inhumanity to man been demonstrated so starkly than in the persecution of the armenians by the ottoman empire and while some 1 500 000 armenian people died and another 500 000 were exiled between 1915 and 1923 this was but the brutal culmination of events stretching back to 1894 in that year 300 000 armenians were massacred and in 1909 a further 21 000 perished all before what is generally considered to be the true genocide beginning 6 years later as an american of greek descent i always have felt a special tie to the armenian people because the land of my ancestors also suffered at the hands of the ottoman turks my colleagues may know that every march i sponsor a special order in this chamber to commemorate greek independence day on that date marks the beginling of greeces struggle ior independence from more than 400 years of domination by the ottoman empire it was on that day that the greek people began a series of uprisings against their turkish oppressors uprising which soon turned into a revolution greece was more fortunate than armenia it did not suffer the dark events that we commemorate today whole villages exterminated thousands and thousands rounded up and iterally worked to death however greeks too know what it means to labor under oppression the greek struggle for independence and the armenian genocide are two events that erupted in the same region of the world and that fit nealy together to form a message it is a message that rings down through the ages and must never be ignored the message is this we must continue to speak out to raise our voices in protest of the mistreatment of our fellow human beings this is a simple matter of right versus wrong it is our duty to call attention to human rights abuses on any scale until the

at the outset i have the highest regard for my colleague the gentleman from texas although i disagree with his amendment he is a very valuable member of the house i am afraid this amendment today should be defeated for the reasons that have been stated and others that i will enumerate at this moment first put this in context as chairman of the disaster task force you cannot view any of these amendments in the context of previous disasters we have on average spent about 3 billion a year on disasters the flood in my part of the country a hurricane in florida an earthquake in california but on the disaster task force we have been told that the socalled big one could occur at any moment in california and certainly a hurricane andrew had it gone a few miles north and hit miami would have cost 50 billion in 1 year so whatever we are about to do should be put in the context of a reality that the cost of disasters could go up dramatically in any given year there is no flexibility in mr johnsons amendment let me tell you four reasons why we should vote against the johnson amendment the gentleman from texas quite wisely says we should pay for our disasters but as has been stated on the floor he wants to pay for them twice once in the year when the disaster occurs by cutting spending then in the following year pay for it again well that frankly is unnecessary and could be counterproductive second the gentleman from texas fails to take into account that the good lord does not pay any attention to our fiscalyear deadlines if a disaster occurs in the united states in august or september and our fiscalyear ends ofi september 30 we somehow have to come up with the disaster funds in the remaining 2 months of that fiscal year to pay for it that is unrealistic we found that in last years midwest flood sothe gentleman by sticking to the strict definition spending cuts only in the year disaster occurs really looks beyond the fact that the disaster may be so late in the fiscal year that we cannot cut enough spending to pay for it the third point i raised in my earlier comments the gentleman falls to take into account that in fiscal year 1991 president bush declared an emergency to pay for desert storm and desert shield president bush was right when he said we are going to take care of the men and women in our armed forces serving in the persian gulf and we are going to pay for it on an emergency basis we are not going to scrimp and cut when it comes to the safety of our kids he was right fortytwo billion dollars was spent on the desert storm emergency under the amendment offered by the gentleman from texas we then would have had to cut the next years appropriation bills by 42 billion to pay for it except for one fact he left out in his thinking our allies came back and paid that 42 billion under the amendment offered by the gentleman from texas we would have still had to cut the next years spending and that cut would have taken place despite the contribution of our allies finally if you take the amount of disaster in 1 year and then spreadthat amount in cuts and spending the next year almost half of those cuts come from the department of defense i say to the gentleman from texas you are going to hear from the gentleman from pennsylvania in a few moments the disastrous consequences on americas military strength if you make that sort of a cut in this day and age and i would also add it would call for cuts for example next year of 1 6 billion in veterans hospitals and another 314 million in agriculture programs i

hydrological balance is poorly defined to indude water quality water quantity and their interrelationships as implemented miners would be required to restore the approximate premining hydrologic

budget authority budget authority is what this process cedes to the appropriations committees to make binding future spending commitments when you reduce budget authority by 2 4 billion as this does you take away 2 4 billion in future spending commitments that is why the national taxpayers union and citizens against government waste have endorsed this because it greatly advances the cause of deficit reduction let us now talk about the reductions that have already held several members here eloquently refuted a statement that no one has made no one has suggested that there have not been cuts in defense spending the question is have they been appropriate yes there have been buts in defense spending partly that is because during the early 1980s when we had a commanderinchief named ronald reagan defense spending was bloated beyond that however there has been achange in the reality that the defense department confronts i guess i should have had some charts i would have had one chart which would have talked about reductions in the warsaw pact threat except the chart would have gone down into the first floor ten years ago we were told that one of the major reasons we were spending money in defense was to prevent the eastern europeans behind the soviet union in a land invasion of western europe nato was created for that we were spending tens and tens of billions of dollars to protect western europe against an attack in which the soviet union led the warsaw pact countries to the west there is no soviet union there is no warsaw pact and several of those countries do not exist anymore no agency of the federal government has seen external reality change for the better as much as the defense department yes there are threats in the world but let us not pretend they are new people said well we have these other threats iraq and iran iraq and iran are menacing countries but they are not new what were iraq and iran in 1984 disneyworld there has been a substantial drop in the nature of the threat we face the capacity of the soviet union to damage us in nuclear war has been substantially diminished although not totally abolished and the warsaw pact has completely disappeared the significant threat is gone so of course we have made some reductions it would have been nuts not to the question is have we made enough people say well there is a shortfall in defense no doubt from the standpoint of the people who run that agency there is a shortfall but we have got some other shortfalls we have a shortfall in police protection in this country we have promised and promised and promised again more police protection but you will spend it up when the pentagon says we need it first we have shortfalls in education shortfalls in health research at the nih shortfalls in environmental cleanup shortfalls in health care for people yes there are shortfalls the nature of government in a time of limited resources is to try to do the best you can to deal with shortfalls but there are people here who get scared politically and who will tell you that the one area where we must immunize them against the threat of shortfall is the pentagon where we are talking national defense that is one thing but we are talking more than national defense we are talking about the greatest charity program in the history of the world the one by which the taxpayers of the united states subsidize again and again and again the richest nations in the world in western europe our western european allies spend a small fraction of what we spend as a percentage of national wealth but that isbecaus6 there are people in this body who believe it is somehow the american taxpayers obligation to subsidize france norway belgium germany italy and other countries because subsfdize them we do they will cut their military budgets they will provide greater services for their own people and we will take up the slack for them no one doubts that we are by far the strongest nation in the world with a considerable margin of superiority over everyone else of course we should be the question is whether we will continue when the rest of the world gets richer and when the threat gets smaller to spend disproportionately on defense there are plenty of places in this function that they can find 2 4 billion we have intelligence the intelligence agencies are the only ones who when they screw up say they need more money when they do not do well that is an argument for giving them moremoney we have the burdensharing where we carry western europe we have weapons systems there and is it a coincidence or was there a high correlation between those who came and spoke for the budget and those who have defense money spent in their districts now the defense department like any other department has a missiofi and it also has goodies to hand out it also has people who benefit from it some of my friends on the other side talked again about the jobs we would lose one of the great inconsistencies in this country is that conservatives who tell you thatthe government is a detractor from jobs the government hurts the economy when the government spends it doesnt hurt anythingexcept for defense where defense is concerned suddenly they become harold ickess and harry hopkins defense for them is the wpa defense spending ought to be treated the same as any

development which is huge department in itself and the my lad other independent agencies the job in distributing the limited pie funds available is very very difficult i for one deeply appreciate whi they have done over the years for ot veterans i really wish that the sul committee could be divided in half at that we would have a separate sul committee on veterans affairs so thi the veterans programs would not hai to compete with all of other agencies be that as it may you folks do great job unfortunately i had to vol against this bill back on june 28 b4 cause it abolished the selective
