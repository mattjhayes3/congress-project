performed in reaching in agreement authorizing 299 6 billion for defense consistiint with last novembers budget summit agreement and the fiscal year 1989 budget resolution i am particularly grateful for the excellent work of the distinguished chairperson or the military personnel and compensation subcommittee mrs byron for her leadership in shepherding legislalion i introduced earlier this year h r 3975 which directs the secretary of defense to establish a permanent rental housing program involving military personnel and their civilian landlords this program will remove perhaps the largest financial burden on our military families this legislation will make permanent the pilot program which has been in effect at fort ord over the last 15 months the program has been implemented with a high degree of success resulting in the solution of problems with military residents with respect to payment and landlords obtaining guarantees on security deposit payments although the senate defense authorization measure did not contain a similar provision h r 4264s housing lease indemnity program was adopted by the senate with two amendments i support both amendments the first amendment clarifies the due process provlsions of the program regarding each participating service members obligation before reducing that members pay for breach of the lease or damage to the rental unit and the other amendment outlines the extension of this program to our service members overseas i would like to take a few minutes to describe what this legislation will do first of all it authorizes the secretary of defense to make the program permanent each military service would then have the option of whether and at which inst llations to institute participation in this program in the united states second civilian landlords who rent to military personnel would agree to waive security deposits when renting housing units to military personnel for the guarantee of rental deposit security from the military in return the military post would agree that if for any reason the service member leaves without making final payments for rent or damage the post would make such final payments these payments could not exceed the amount of an ordinarily required security deposit any outlays of the military post would then be deducted from the service members paycheck for example a service member wants to rent an apartment for 500 per month under this legislation the landlord would agree to accept only a first months rent without any required security deposit or last months rent right away we are saving the service member up to 1 000 if the service member if transferred to another post or is assigned to onpost housing and leaves his apartment without paying his last months rent the post to which he is assigned would meet the last months rent payment of 500 this 500 would then be deducted from the service members paycheck all of my colleagues are aware of the tremendous financial and emotional pressures inflicted on our military personnel and their families this already tense situation is made even worse during a permanent change of station move travel and relocation expenses come out of the pockets of our servicemen and women reimbursement comes later although in the past only 1 out of 4 spent on a pcs move has been reimbursed according to an air force study and when the military families arrive in a new location they must meet the immediate costs of security deposits first and last months rent utility deposits and more before you can even blink a military family can be thousands of dollars in debt and 2 years later the entire process is repeated it is important to note that no appropriation of funds is necessary because the service member would be ultimately responsible for meeting the costs of any damage or breach of lease i know that the landlords on the monterey peninsula have benefited from the pilot program the favorable comments from the civilian landlords show that the vacancy rate has dropped considerably in their particular apartment complexes since participating in the program also a housing referral office representative available when requested during moveout inspections provided the verification necessary to resolve any disputes or misunderstandings that arose at that time they realize the hardships imposed on the military family and they understand the progam guarantees payment for damages and breach of lease up to the amount of the usual security deposit this program gives landlords one point of contact for all their military tenants and a source of information regarding military personnel who may soon be transferred thus enabling landlords to prepare for a change in the lease soldiers have been very happy with the program because without it they could not afford a place to live and would therefore be forced to live apart from their families until onpost housing became available the program has also kept soldiers from getting into serious financial difficulties which is often associated with a pcs move this program should solve one of the major problems facing our military personnel and do away with certainly one of their largest financial burdens what is more no one loses in this program everyone wins landlords are guaranteed payment our military personnel are able to use their hardearned dollars for necessities and the services are guaranteed reimbursement for any outlays to landlords when the house voted in the 99th congress to accept many proposals to ease the burdens on our military personnel servicemen and women all over the world breathed a sigh of relief now this legislation will resolve one of the most pressing and financially disabling issues by making permanent this highly successful pilot program permanent so that one day our military men and women will not look on military service as a financially crippling experience again i want to thank the conferees

believe that we have in place a strong national network of quality programs in which we can all take pride the past present and future success of our child nutrition programs is dependent on a strong federal state and local public and private sector partnership willing to invest the necessary resources to meet the nutritional needs of our nations youngsters when they are in awayfromhome settings at the heart of this network is the oldest and largest of our child nutrition programsthe national school lunch program today the national school lunch program provides nutritionally balanced meals to approximately 24 million school age children or 92 percent of all schoolchildren federal support is provided to participating school districts in a mix of cash and commodity support what level of support the federal government provides is in an inverse relationship to the economic status of the childs family the highest levels of federal support go to meeting the costs of providing meals to our neediest youngsters this is as it should be two important companion programs deserve mention the first is our school breakfast program which is designed to ensure that all youngsters begin their school day with the nutrients necessary to benefit fully from the days educational experience thanks to congressional action during the last congress i am pleased to note that modest increases in both cash and commodity assitance will now be available to improve the overall quality of the breakfast program meal patterns while our school lunch and breakfast programs play a vital part in meeting nutritional needs during the regular school year the summer feeding program complements that initiative by providing nutritious meals to our neediest youngsters during the summer months one of our fastest growing child nutrition activities is the child care food program which essentially provides meal services appropriate to youngsters enrolled in day care centers or family day care homes as more two wageearner families and growing numbers of single heads of households join our labor force the child care food progam will assume an everincreasing role in meeting the nutritional wellbeing of our younger children no overview of the status of our child nutrition programs would be complete without the mention of the special supplemental food program for women infants and childrenmore popularly referred to as the wic program wic is an early health intervention program that seeks to provide individually tailored food packages to lowincome pregnant women new mothers infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk medical services and nutrition education round out the wic program benefits wic program benefits cost an average of 30 per month in return studies clearly demonstrate that wic does make a difference in increasing the birth weights of infants of lowincome women who are at nutritional risk and the probability that these infantswill

training for american competitiveness act of 1987 i want to first commend chairman hawkins for the bipartisan spirit with which he approached this task all of the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle had an opportunity to contribute to what is included in this title although we may not all agree to everything the bill contains i think we all can attest to the fact that without a welleducated and trained citizenry we have no hope of maintaining any competitive edge in the world marketplace just this morning i attended a press conference of the congressional competitiveness caucus of which i am a member the caucus released its recommendations at the press conference and i am pleased to note that many of its recommendations are already included in the bill before us or are pending in other legislation this includes a total revamping of the jtpa title iiidislocated workerprogram to ensure rapid response to mass layoffs and plant closings encourage and facilitate the formation of joint labormanagement committees to address worker dislocations and broaden the range of available services for dislocated workers in the education area the caucus made several recommendations which are either addressed in the bill before us or in h r 5 the school improvement act these include reauthorization of the education for economic security act incentives for unitedstates graduate engineering and foreign language students expansion of the chapter i program to increase the services for high school students and areas with high concentrations of disadvantaged youth and incentives for private sector workplace initiatives to encourage businesses to work with local adult literacy programs unfortunately there is one recommendation made by the competitiveness caucus which is not addressed in this bill the establishment of a portable pension program to meet the needs of an increasingly mobile labor force just as workers need to upgrade and diversity their skills they also need to be able to ipreserve and maximize those retirement benefits which they have already accrued this simply does not happen in the fragmented system which is currently in place i have introduced legislationh r 1961 the portable pension act which will address this inadequacy i had hoped that this bill which was cosponsored by chairman hawkins mr clay and mrs roukema could be included in the bill before us but we have decided to defer action to allow more time for public consideration and comment i expect the bill to be brought before the full house later this year so that we can do what we are leaving undone today it is critical that we begin to look for ways to increase literacy to improve the mathematical and scientific abilities of our students to improve the basic research infrastructure of our colleges and universities and to increase and improve the private sector involvement in our vocational education programs addressing each of these concerns would clearly improve our ability to remain a productive country the education programs that are included in this proposal attempt to address these issues it is important for us not to lose sight of this goal perhaps most closely related to the issue of competitiveness is our ability to meet the challenge of providing meaningful and useful education training and other relevant services to our dislocated workers the worker readjustment program included in this bill is a giant step in that direction a mere 2v2 months ago our committee was presented with three separate bills to address the problem of dislocated workers my own worker readjustment and placement act wrapi the fordclaymartinez economic dislocation and worker adjustment assistance act and the administrations proposal in addition the gentleman from wisconsin has strongly and effectively advocated a greater focus upon the needs of rural areas where a different type of dislocation problem is surfacing historically the job training programs have been fashioned in a bipartisan manner and i sincerely hoped that this bill would be no exception meanwhile while we generally agreed that each of the three proposals took a distinct approach to the dislocated worker problem i believe we also recognized that all three contained creative and useful ideas indeed it seemed a formidable task to try to meld them together but it was also clear that without such a synthesis any effort at a consensus would fail i am pleased to observe that this final package takes the best of all three bills and more importantly shapes them into a consistent whole as recently as 2 years ago we still had a very limited focus on this problem thanks to secretary brock the brock task force my colleagues from the other side of the aisle and the leadership of our chairman mr hawkins we are able to present to the house an approach that is both comprehensive and consensual the comprehensiveness of this approach builds upon our consideration of this problem in the previous congress for the past decade the primary focus in this area has been upon proposed mandates for employersadvance notice consultation with unions relocation penalties and so forth however these proposals have only addressed a portion of the problem even if you provide notice to workers of an impending layoff what options do they have to remain a productive part of the work force and to maintain the quality of living to which they are accustomed as stated in the 1986 office of technology assessment special report entitled plant closing advance notice and rapid response advance notice alone 1 0 is not enough it needs to be tied to prompt effective action to help displaced workers find or train for adequate jobs it is a prerequisite for constructive action not the constructive action itself that constructive action has sorely needed a better blueprint it was this and other questions which prompted me to join with the gentlewoman from new jersey mrs rouxem a and the gentleman from wisconsin in requesting labor secretary william brock to appoint a task force composed of business and labor leaders government officials and academicians to study the dislocated worker problem the result of our request exceeded our highest expectations first of all contrary to what many observers anticipated the task force was able to reach the following consensus the task force believes that worker dislocation is a problem that will not simply disappear if nothing is done nor is it so immense that it defies resolution the problem is of sufficient magnitude and increasing urgency that it demands an effective coordinated response with special priority by both the public and private sectors the task force noted that the united states lacks a comprehensive coordinated strategy to deal with the dislocated worker problem and characterized previous responses from the government and the private sector as spotty and narrowly focused the task force proposed a new national effort with a federally supported and guided structure funded at 900 million providing for stateadministered training and reemployment assistance for all displaced workers the report of the task force on economic adjustment and worker dislocation combined with other forces to prompt the administration to seek a new dislocated worker initiative as a high priority within its budget with a proposed tripling of federal resources to address the problem from the proposal submitted by secretary brock we have adopted the basic delivery system which delegates responsibility for the program primarily to the states meanwhile the actual service are brought down to the substate level of ensure coordination with the jtpa system from the fordclaymartinez bill we have strengthened the rapid response capability of the title iii dislocated worker programs under this bill any substantial layoff or plant closing will prompt immediate contact from a state dislocated worker unit which is identifiable to employers and workers throughout the state finally from my own wrap bill we will promote the establishment of labormanagement committees at the plantsite to coordinate readjustment activities for the affected workers at that plant this concept is modeled after the canadian industrial adjustment service iasi which chairman hawkins and i found to be so impressive during our visit to canada and in our hearing on the subject on march 12 of this year in the task force report the ias is cited as an effective approach and is singled out among all foreign endeavors studied as the one offering the highest degree of replicability in the united states like the ias the bill before us offers a simple lowcost approach which is purely voluntary on the part of employers and workers it requires each state to designate a dislocated worker unit which includes a corps of specialists who will be authorized to provide financial assistance for the operating costs of labormanagement committees existing at the plantsite for the purpose of devising and implementing a worker assistance strategy the employer will also participate in paying the costs of the committee in order to facilitate a rapid response the state specialist will be able to provide the initial startup installment immediately while the financial assistance authorized by the state specialist will be only for the operating costs of the committee it is expected that the committee will also likely tie into other separately funded programs including those funded under the new jtpa title iii because of the voluntary nature of the program i would encourage the state to hire these specialists with a background in the private sector since this would be an essential component in establishing credibility and a communication network with the business and labor community this is confirmed by a recent gao report entitled dislocated workers exemplary local projects under the job training partnership act in which it was stated that a key ingredient to the success of the projects was having staff with local labor market expertise and extensive contacts with local employers once the joint labormanagement committee has been formed one of the first tasks would normally be to compile all relevant information regarding each employee through a questionnaire with this information the committee can then develop a marketing strategy for each employee and then make an aggressive search of businessess in the geographic area which might have openings ideally committee members will be individuals whose own position for example plant manager foremanhas given them personal knowledge of the abilities and skills of each employee this knowledge not only will enable them to focus upon relevant positions for reemployment but will also give them credibility in getting a potential employer to set up a job interview i emphasize that these labormanagement committees will operate entirely on a cooperative basis and will not require uninterested employers to do anything moreover they will be relatively inexpensive according to testimony received by the committee from canadian officials the average operating costs of each committee in canada have been about 15 000 of which the ias normally pays 50 percent meanwhile if these committees work as effectively as the ias system they will result in net savings through reduced unemployment insurance costs in canada this program has resulted in estimated savings of 25 5 million offset by only 9 9 million in government costs ultimately i see the worker readjustment act as accomplishing dual purposes on the one hand it will alleviate the suffering and financial hardships experienced by workers whose careers are disrupted by upheavals in our dynamic economy at the same time it will strengthen that economy by tapping a source of productive workers whose only shortcoming is a lack of relevant skills in demand in the marketplace in the long run we

i yield myself 6 minutes i rise in opposition to this request for aid to the contras i think that it is useful in reviewing this proposal to put it to two tests the first test is does the policy work on the ground in nicaragua and is it likely to succeed this is a military action by soldiers that we are supporting and i think that as we think about whether or not they could militarily succeed putting aside the cia reports and even our own defense reports that say they are unlikely to overthrow the sandinistas it is important to review a little history of our involvement in nicaragua the united states has invaded nicaragua 12 times in history if you go the 1920s and 1930s it sounds an awful lot like the congressional record of today and if you look at the old newspapers from those periods you will see that the headlines remind you of the headlines of today so to the people of nicaragua the people that were involved in those times this is nothing new 1 1700 i think a second fact we must recognize is that in the late 1970s when this country underwent a revolution 50 000 nicaraguans lost their lives this is a country of about 3 3 million and if we remember in the vietnam conflict we lost about 50 000 people on almost any day you can drive by the vietnam memorial here and get a sense of what that conflict and that loss of life meant in this country so we can imagine what that meant in nicaragua when we begin thinking about whether or not a military solution to the problem is something that can work on the ground in nicaragua so i simply submit on the basis of that anecdotal evidence and the evidence we see from our own military and our own central intelligence agency that having a military policy and a military solution to our problems is not likely to succeed i think the next thing we should look at is this does the policy reach the goals and the vital interests of the united states on this point i think there has been some confusion because we have many different goals that are enunciated by the administration i think we should try to better articulate what our goals are i think there are two i think we have two vital interests in nicaragua the first is to reduce the foreign military influences in that country certainly soviet cuban libyan whatever foreign military influence is in this country and the second is to keep the sandinistas from interfering with their neighbors with many of whom we have treaties and obligations if we put this policy against that testwhat are our goals and are we reaching them i think members would agree with me that we are not previous speakers on the other side have said that we just cannot negotiate with communists certainly there are people in our country who have that view i do not think the president has that view if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with mikhail gorbachev and the soviet union if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with the chinese on a variety of subjects and i believe that the president has even said that the contras are in the field in order to put pressure on the sandinistas so that we can get to negotiations to resolve and reconcile our vital interests if that is our goal then what are the people in the region who are leading the effort and working to make this effort come about saying about contra aid president arias who is the author of the live and viable plan of the moment said when he received his nobel peace prize that president reagan knows very welland i quote that the contras are the problem and not the solution and yesterday the people who have been active n the contadora process said this we urgently call upon the countries with ties or interests in the region to halt unconditionally unilaterally and immediately any actions aimed at destablization or any type of aid to irregular forces as is established in the san jose declaration for the attainment of peace and democracy n central america in conclusion i would say let us give peace a chance let us give the people in the region a chance we have been trying the military solution for 6 years now let us give the other way a chance let us give life to the words of a great american uttered about his brother when he said we see wrong and try to right it we see suffering and try to heal it and we see war and try to stop it we have tried the

melvin wolf an american author who has described in his book how the japanese government through the ministry of international trade and industry conspired along with some of the major japanese industries to target and to destroy some of our very important industries some of our very basic industries those industries include everything ranging from typewriters to computers along with reading some sections from that book i have illu rated from current events and current news stories certain events that are happening today and how they fit into that book today i have before me a column from a chicago newspnper which refers to the industrial base which is really what the japanese conspiracy is all about rnd the impact on the industrial base in the united states and how its destruction has been targeted from overseas and what is happening to it aned why we need to export this particular article written by william neikirk in the june 5 addition of the chicago tribune is entitled economy ieeds goods not paper in the article the writer describes an incident that is happening in which shearson lehman iutton is reported to be greatly surprised to find the people of pittsburgh angry over the fact that that financial house took an equity position in its clients successful attempt to take over koppers co well the whole essense of the article is thet the financial company was really playing paper trying to get a venture capitalist to come in to koppes co which was at one time one of the most important manufacturing entities ini the united states in my own district in maryland we had some koppers operations and now they are all gone and that certainly is a loss because we are losing a lot of skilled machinists and others of these skilled trades that are so vital to the national security of this country as well as to the financial security of this country in the concluding remarks by mr neikirk after describing what is happemning in the financial markets through the shuffling of paper and that ie says it would be easy to dismiss thls groupthink atinosphre were it not so predominately influential over the very pollcymarers attending the conference here and that was a conference in pittsburgh mr neikirk continues so let us toke this rare opportunity to give a secondcity view or a thirdcity view whichever you prefer and he said that the secondcity or the thirdcity view is that americas future lies chiefly in the export of machine tools cars steel medical equnment agriculture goods airplanc textiles computers and many other goods curtailing this flow of goods will only harm the international economy like it or not mr nelkirk says the economys health is linked to the nations manufacturing prowessnot its skill in manipulating the paper values of wall street let me take each of those items that he has mentioned there each of these items has been described in a chapter of tile japanese conspiracy and how that industry was targeted by the ministry of international trade and industry one of hese items was automobiles and we all know what is happening in thie automobile industry we all know how the foreign imports have literally weakened and taken over nearly half of our automobile industry there are now some reports i understand that the imports from japan have dropped down some well that is a phoney figure because what they have done instead is to set up assembly plants in the united states so that they can assemble their goods here and they will not be included in the total figure of autonobilc imports f rom overseas then we have steel and we all know what has happened to the steel industry we know how our finished products from this country have literally been wiped out and most of what we are producing here is semifinished steel and steel plate some of that is too large to ship economically by ship or airplane then we have machine tools and that is indeed a very very sad story machine tools is one of our most important basic industries and it is an industry that definitely was targeted and sabotage literally took place in the destruction of that industry this was a very well laid out plan by miti and its machine tool manufacturers and we know how even after our commission the international commerce commission found that japan was dumping macbine tools in this country and how they had plotted and how after our cabinet had determined yes indeed that they were dumped upon and that our industries were being destroyed how that was undermined by a staff member of the japanese embassy sitting outside the cabinet room where the meetings were going on and notifying prime minister nakaione by telephone so he could call president reagan even before presldent reagan heard from his own cabinet and he got president reagan to pledge that he would not uphold his own cabinets determination in the underminin g of machine tools c0 1220 and so on and on it goes and into the computers aun e 9 1988 i am not going to get into the computer situation today i may do it tomorrow or i will do it next week except to touch on another article concerning the computers and that has to deal with ibm ibm as we all know is one of our largest manufacturers one of our most important manufacturers in the computer business and many of our office products and this article deals with another book in essence a book put out by clyde prestowltz on what is happening again in the trade pictvre and he called his book tradinoy places how we allow japan to take the lead clyde prestowitz was formerly the commerce departments chief trade negotiator with japan and he is now a senior associate at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington and in his book he points out that ibm has offered to supply vital computer chip technology to its archrival digital equipment corp rather than to see digital becoming increasingly dependent on japanese suppliers and this is laid out in his book and the importance of that is again according to this article from the new york times the author attests to the seriousness of the concern with which ibm the nations largest computer manufacturer views the growing dependence of the american computer industry on the japanese semiconductor technology and that is the importance of itis are we becoming so dependent on foreign semiconductor technology that we are going to be totally beholden or totally in their hands and this statement says that ibm believes such dependence will weaken the american electronics industry and ultimately ibm and so they wanted to get another unitedstates firm give it some strength give it some beckbone and say hey come out there and compete with us well help you we dont want to become so dependent upon foreign sources and again reading on in that article the report also attests to the huge role that ibm is playing mostly behind the scenes in trying to prop up the american semiconductor industry in the global battle for the future of the electronics industry and i might point out that in our longstanding battle with toshiba that toshiba of course being a major corporation in japan the one that we have all been battling because one of its subsidiaries sold the secret milling equipment the milling equipment that made silent submarine propellers for the soviet union and which a number of us here on the floor were endeavoring to have barred from the united states and in the lobbying effort by toshiba we found that a number of american corporations were assisting this lobbying and saying hey you cant bar all toshiba products from the united states because we need them now the fact that they aresaying that they needed them attests again to the fact that we are becoming so dependent upon the semiconductor industry in japan that we may soon be totally in their hands and let ms go on and point out some of the good things that happened between ibm and digital and how maybe we can once again push for american companies to stand up together it points out that ibm was a prime mover behind the formation of sematech a research consortium of the nations leading semiconductor companies whose purpose is to make that american industry competitive again and i understand that this is the one industry the one organization that is trlly all american and we need to do more of that in this country today f emiconductors are the silicon chips that are the basis for computers telephones missiles and all otherielectronic products this new york times article goes on to explain the japanese electronics companies have made great advances in this field and are now world leaders in some areas of semiconductor technology and that again is because of much of the conspiracy that went on in the 1970s and early 1980s which i will get into on another day in this particular industry mr andre pollack who writes this says it wouid be a rare move for ibm to license this advanced semiconductor technology or sell chips to a competitor because the company views its advanced chip technology as one of its majpr competitive weapons but it would be particularly surprising for the company to offer such technology to digital the nations second largest computer maker and a company that has made great gains in the marketplace recently at ibms expense but once again apparently they were thinking of the united states and the strength that was needed in the united states for american companies and the article goes on i will just touch on a couple of paragraphs in it that are so crucial to what is happening here the issue of dependency on foreign chips has become charged in the last 2 years some industry analysts say american computer companies are becoming dangerously dangerously dependent on japanese chipmakers the japanese chipmakers being fujitsu hitachi toshiba and nec and these are also major competitors in the computer business and could use the dependence and could use the dependence of their american rivals to their advantage and this is what many of us are concerned about in the current shortage of memory chips for example some executives feel that japanese computer companies as any company would do are satisfying their own chip needs before selling to outsiders in other words well get you dependent upon us and then were going to cut off your supply would that not be a great way to win an economic war now the article by mr pollack says well the fear of dependence which is dismissed by other people in industry and government as overblown was the basis for a report issued by a department of defense advisory arm last year that led to government financing for sematech so it is not all just some of us throwing out a red herring there is a real basis for being concerned along this line ibm makes most of its own chips it says and would therefore be expected not to be concerned about dependence on the japanese but interestingly enough in the lobbying effort for toshiba ibm was one of those in there and again saying that they did need some of the toshiba products actually however mr pollack says it seems more concerned than anyone else according to the sources that is because ibm depends on other companies for the equipment and the materials it uses to make chips without a thriving american semiconductor industry ibm believes the american chipmaking equipment industry will also wither and making ibm dependent on its japanese competitors for all these equipment it needs and that is what we have to watch for in this country mr prestowitz in his book said that ibm also feared that if american companies had to depend on japan they would become politically neutralized in disputes between the two countries ibm supported the 1986 semiconductor agreement between the united states and japan which was meant to help the american semiconductor industry but many other american computer companies initially opposed it saying it would hurt them because it would lead to higher chip prices and on and on we go and only this past week there were articles in newspapers about how once again japan is not living up to or not willing to work out the terms of an agreement in the semiconductor industry so what i am trying to point out in all these discussions is fairliess it is a matter of fairness we have opened up our doors totally to these foreign countries to japan and to others but their barriers are there and they are engaged in targeting and destroying our industries and we need to be careful we need to be ever watchful the united states more than ever needs a marshall plan for the united states in order to retain what is left of its industrial base and to build it up once again just as we helped europe and japan build up after world war ii now it our time and we need to do it here jne 9 1988"], [0.0007962882518768311, 0.49920371174812317, 0, "i rise in strong support of the michel substitute this member supports congressional efforts to provide assistance in meeting catastrophic health care costs for elderly americans the issue is one of approachhow best to meet catastrophic health care costs without saddling future generations with a debt too enormous to pay the pending committee bill h r 2941 is seriously flawed and i will vote against it alternatively i will support the substitute that will be offered by the distinguished republican leader mr michel i am a cosponsor of mr michels legislation this body has begun to take important steps in the right direction in protecting elderly americans against catastrophic health care costs and the most important step today would be a vote in favor of the michel substitute consider this the alternative proposed by mr michel provides for lower monthly premiums than does the committees version the michel substitute addresses the need for longterm custodial care in a more feasible manner most importantly the michel substitute is not a tax increase for the elderly we are today proposing sweeping changes to the medicare program no matter which proposal we eventually adopt before we agree to these sweeping changes in the medicare program this member appeals to this body for caution and restraint this proposed initiative if enacted will be with us for a very long time the question of how we will pay for this important new program in the next decades cannot be ignored in our actions today make no mistake about it this member believes we need to protect elderly americans from the catastrophic costs of serious illness the legislation we are considering today begins to plug up some of the holes in medicare that allow catastrophic health care costs we are addressing the need to alleviate spousal impoverishment we are considering the role that skilled nursing care and prescription drugs play in the creation of catastrophic costs and we recognizing the humane benefits of home health care services which help elderly americans avoid institutionalization ideally however we need by a variety of public and nonpublic means to protect all americans from the catastrophic costs of severe illness i am extremely disturbed by the fact that each year hundreds of thousands of citizens face the horrendous choice between health and poverty this is intolerable nearly 35 million americans under 65 reported no health insurance from any public or private source onethird of all these uninsured people are childrenthats 12 million children and 4 million of those live with uninsured parents or guardians too often young growing families are forced to choose between a small childs health or their familys poverty no parent should be forced to make such a choice but this legislative initiative must not foster a battle between young and old rich and poor this effort must really be a struggle to insure all americans against the devastating impact of financial catastrophe and medical crisis to do this realistically we must identify the potential and serious problem areas hospital and medical care costs are inflating at significant rates unfortunately it is also clear that when a new pool of costs is added in the form of increased premiums the potential for further inflationary impact is considerably increased sadly this member fears that the bill as reported by the ways and means committee and the energy and commerce committee simply will not ultimately assist in alleviating the catastrophic costs for todays baby boom generationa group who will certainly comprise the largest numbers of elderly americans bailing a few buckets from a sinking ship today does not guarantee that it will not sink tomorrow if we do not choose a viable proposal now we cannot possibly keep up with the costs that will occur beyond the 5 year cost projections on which the pending bill is based we cannot shut our eyes to the longrange effects of h r 2941 we must not enact laws to make ourselves more comfortable today without looking at the impact of such legislation in the future the department of health and human services estimates for example that costs of h r 2941 will exceed revenues after 1992 they predict annual program deficits of 10 billion by the year 2000 and 30 billion by the year 2005 for the ways and means proposal and those figures do not take into account the energy and commerce committees amendments that are now a part of h r 2941 those additions will add another 13 billion to the cost of catastrophic health care coverage in the first 5 years in just 13 years we may be facing an annual deficit of 10 billion from this single new legislative initiative who will pay for such expanding costsour children and our grandchildren yours and minel this member believes we really must not pass unreasonable burdens on to our children and grandchildren therefore this member urges his colleagues to put aside the partisan considerations that too often drive this body the michel substitute is better for americanow and especially in the future the costs are significantly lower and many of the important features of the committees bill are retained in a similar or identical fashion the substitute caps outofpocket expenses at 2 000 the substitute eliminates coinsurance for limited skilled nursing facility care the substitute increases home health care from the current 21 days to 35 days the substitute covers outpatient prescription drugs for poor elderly the substitute protects against spousal impoverishment we in the congress can act responsibly today in a manner that can lay the groundwork for a humane and really responsible program of catastrophic health care coverage for all americans i urge my colleagues to adopt the michel substitute"], [0.0009908676147460938,
