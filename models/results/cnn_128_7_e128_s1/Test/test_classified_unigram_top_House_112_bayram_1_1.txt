house republicans are proposing to strip seniors of this guaranteed benefit the republican budget proposal dismantles medicare as we know it telling seniors they are going to be on their own to find insurance no matter what the cost or how sick they are and it slashes medicaid coverage for seniors who need longterm care threatening our sickest most frail elderly in nursing homes with no care at all this is absolutely the wrong approach to solving our nations budget problems every day 48 million elderly and disabled americans across this country count on medicare for their lifesaving medications doctor visits and hospital care sixtynine percent of people over the age of 65 and they are both democrats and republicans oppose medicare becoming a voucher program seniors know that changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs that the voucher would become insufficient over time and the care they need could become unaffordable that too many taxpayer dollars will be spent on advertising campaigns and administrative costs instead of actual medical expenses and seniors know that privatizing medicare means limits on benefits obstacles to care uncertain reimbursements copayments for primary care or specialty care exclusions for certain services discrimination based on income illness or age and more uncertainty if a serious illness or need for longterm care occurs seniors know that privatizing or voucherizing medicare will mean that they pay more in premiums or do without and it doesnt end there in addition to medicare cuts republicans also want to take away medicaid for the nearly 6 million seniors who depend on it for nursing home or longterm care they say proudly that they will cut funding to states by 1 trillion this means that disabled and frail elderly americans will be placed on waiting lists for services or have no access to care at all in pennsylvania my home state nearly 40 percent of funds spent on longterm care would be at risk this includes 62 percent of nursing home residents and 25 000 pennsylvanian seniors who receive home health services and yet when republicans had the opportunity to reduce costs while maintaining and strengthening care for our seniors they demonized the plan voting time and again to stop important improvements in medicare and they still want to repeal the law that eliminates copayments for preventive care services that makes prescription drug benefits more affordable and improves coordination of care and health outcomes reduces errors and reduces costs for seniors they want to repeal the law that curbs the growth in medicare spending saves taxpayers almost 500 billion by ending overpayments to insurance companies and extends the life of the medicare trust fund for 12 years instead the republicans here in washington want to end medicare as we know it and put health care for american seniors at great risk as a senior member of the budget committee i know how important it is to find solutions to reducing the deficit to do this right the solution must include spending cuts tax policy reform and economic growth we should not fix our budget problems by failing to meet our obligations to our seniors every day we hear how determined republicans are to slash billions of dollars from the central programs because we simply cant afford it they say we cant afford to make investments in the future we cant afford to educate our children or fix our roads or fuel innovation or cover health care costs for seniors yet in the same proposal to slash medicare and medicaid for millions of seniors republicans make permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans in the very same budget proposal where republicans take away guaranteed benefits for seniors they protect billions of tax subsidies to the oil and gas industry in the very same budget proposal where republicans give seniors a limited voucher to pay for higher insurance premiums they protect the pentagon from spending cuts on unnecessary weapon systems one trillion dollars in tax expenditures 700 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy few 40 billion in tax breaks for oil companies and billions of dollars to continue inefficiencies at the pentagonall of this spending is protected by the republican budget and instead they choose to slash benefits to our seniors and our disabled americans budgets are about priorities and theyre about our values yes we should get serious about our nations deficit but lets be sure that our priorities are right and we do not threaten our obligations to our seniors to our children or to americas future"],

recovery unfortunately the majoritys priorities are deeply out of touch with those of the country democrats are committed to reducing the deficit we believe as taxpayers do that we should start by

continue the tax breaks for the top 2 percent of the country republicans are in a reckless rush to slash without regard to the impact on our economy on the businesses which create jobs or on middle class or working families who are being responsible doing the best for their families and educating for the future they are hitting ordinary hardworking families with children our young people trying to get an education and the elderly that is their starting point under their budget every student in america receiving a pell grant close to 9 million people will see their aid slashed by almost 850 a year 1 3 million students will lose their supplemental education opportunity grants and thus the ability to pay for college their plan cuts more than 200 000 kids out of head start kids who will forever lose the opportunity for an early childhood education they cut aid to school districts and special education they will cut 55 000 head start teachers and close down 16 000 head start classrooms as with education so too with jobs in the midst of a recession and a tough labor market training and employment services proventowork programs are cut now by 5 billion that means 8 4

least 10 million new meals delivered to the homebound elderly cuts fuel assistance for them as well it will force seniors to either go hungry or move into nursing homes and others to have to choose whether to eat or to stay warm the challenge is not whether we address the deficit and spending or not the question is where do we start to cut do we start with slashing ineffective programs and special interest waste like 40 billion in oil company subsidies or do we start cutting those that help the middle class our businesses and working families with children and seniors our job is to get this budget back to common sense to create jobs to get this economy running again for the people of this nation this continuing resolution offered by the republicans will do neither"],

across the countryand we are way behind every other nation almost industrialized nations anywayand hurt local and state economies this is the latest in the majoritys agenda that can best be described as pennywise and poundfoolish in their pledge to america the majority made a promise to the american people we will fight efforts to use a national crisis for political gain they declared sadly thats what theyre doing today using the tragedy of natural disasters in americas heartland as a political tool to try to eliminate a job creation program one of the very few we have is just wrong thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in economic investment are at stake and yet this fight brought to us today is little more than an unnecessary ideological battle the highspeed and intercity passenger rail program is critical to our countrys competitiveness it puts americans back to work revitalizes our construction and manufacturing sectors boosts the domestic economy and helps end unitedstates dependence on foreign oil it is both unwise and ineffective to cut important funding from one project in order to pay for disaster relief we are a nation that should be able to both build for the futurein fact we mustand provide for our fellow citizens in need today highspeed rail creates jobs every 1 billion of highspeed rail and intercity passenger rail construction funding supports 24 000

economic development in my home state of new york the united states conference of mayors estimates at least 21 000 new jobs and 1 1 billion in new wages with the construction of highspeed rail along the empire corridor from buffalo to albany highspeed rail also creates the economic corridors of the future a highspeed rail line in western new york as currently planned would reduce travel time significantly and expand the western new york labor market to 955 562 workers this would make us the 26th largest metro area in the nation and that means new businesses will be drawn to the area as we connect our cities to montreal toronto new york city and the rest of the eastern seaboard and for the first time in many areas we may even be able to go west in new york highspeed rail will be our next erie canal nationally it is rightfully being compared to our national highway system both spurred local development and brought millions of jobs to our state and the nation at this point in time

unprecedented work already being done by the fra and its partners fra the states amtrak and infrastructureowning railroads have made significant progress in reaching service outcome agreements to

to create the kind of uncertainty thats out there obviously it has an impact not just in the defense sector but also in all of the other areas in which our federal government has activities i would just sayand i want to make sure the chairman is on the floor now and has a chance to respondthat he demonstrated some leadership on this issue last fall because he was asked this question he was asked if he had to put together a plan that included some revenue he said yes i understand that weve got to make cuts but id rather include some revenue than deep cuts to defense in fact what he said was were going to have to stop repeating ideological talking points and address our budget problems comprehensively through smarter spending and increased revenue when asked to choose between deeper cuts in defense and cutting some tax breaks he said we should cut some tax breaks that was last fall thats exactly the kind of balanced approach that the democrats put forward in the budget committee the chairman of the committee asked for a specific plan we had a vote on it in the budget committee we wish that our colleagues would have supported it it would have prevented the sequester from taking place for another year and it would have eliminated all of the uncertainty the chairman of the armed services committee just talked about the reason that we havent been able to move forward is that our republican colleagues continue to insist on supporting these tax breaks for special interests and tax breaks for folks at the very top and that they refuse to eliminate those tax breaks for the purpose of reducing the deficit or for the purpose of eliminating the sequester on defense and nondefense thats why we are in the situation we are in right now the keys to the lock are in the hands of our republican colleagues we had the same proposal ready to bring to a vote before the whole house of representatives as part of the reconciliation process the rules committee didnt even allow our proposal to be made in order so that members of this body could vote on it up or down so yes lets get on with the main issue lets focus on replacing the sequester lets do it in a balanced way i have to say since the gentleman from texas earlier referenced the comments of senator reids the majority leader ive looked at the senators comments the senators point was the same one im making here which is that if we are going to remove the sequester we need to take a balanced approach we need to include cuts again its important to remember we did 1 trillion in cuts100 percent cutsas part of the budget control act but we also need to include some revenue by eliminating some of these special interest tax breaks and by asking folks at the very top of the income ladder to pay a little bit more

the same bill they increase the budget for coal for oil for gas for nuclear they increase it while they eviscerate while they annihilate the clean energy budget the future energy agenda for our

going to capitulate are we going to just become a country where were importing oil or are we going to move to a solar future a wind future an allelectric vehicle future over the next 20 and 30 and 40 years you know this budget that they have put together is really one that gets right to the heart of their argument that they say they care about all of the above what this budget actually says is it is oil above all its still a fossil fuel agenda its not a technologyoriented agenda its not an agenda that can help us to turn the corner and to create new technologies that move us to a 21st century agenda but see this in the larger picture this is not compromise the defense budget last week went up 17 billion theyre not going to cut defense theyre saying theyre not going to actually take away the tax breaks for billionaires theyre saying theyre not actually going to take away the tax breaks for the oil and gas industry all of that is safe dont worry they say to billionaires dont worry they say to big oil dont worry they say to the defense department were not touching you in this big budget deal that we want and then where do they turn they turn over here to solar and wind and to geothermal and biomass to plugin hybrids to all the technologies that we should be investing in in the future and they turn to grandma and say your medicare benefit is too big they turn to medicaid they say you poor child youre taking too much of americas wealth and you green energy sector we cant afford to invest in you so ladies and gentlemen this is not compromise this is the capitulation that they are looking for from the democrats this is the capitulation to an agenda that helps billionaires helps big oil helps big gas helps us export jobs overseas by keeping those tax breaks in place rather than fighting hard for what the green generationthe young people in our countryexpect us to do rather than allowing ourselves to be tipped upside down at the gasoline pump all i do is take 100 million move it from the coal subsidies the oil and the gas subsidies and move it over move it over to solar and wind to plugin hybrids to all electric vehicles and with that by the way ladies and gentlemen they still havent been cut this year in this budget thats just taking away the increase that they get in this budget and we still havent made up for all of the cuts in the solar and wind and clean energy budget that they continue to slash so ladies and gentlemen its 100 million does oil and coal and gas deserve an increase this year lets at least keep them level and give that extra 100 million over to the clean energy technologies of the future that is the least that the green generation the young people in our country expect us to do because its not only imported oil its

today this bill would allow communities in north dakota to construct levees on land that was so floodprone that federal taxpayers bought out the property owners on the condition of no future development construction of the levees will inevitably lead to more high risk development and future costs to taxpayers in short the taxpayer will be forced to pay twice or more the federal emergency management agency hazard mitigation grant program hmgp enables voluntary buyouts of frequently flooded property and to prevent future losses and costs to the federal government the communities agree not to develop the property in the future instead of rectifying specific instances where problems with the program may have arisen or pursuing other solutions this bill applies broadly across the state of north dakota in fact while this legislation is specifically targeted at north dakota the bill would set a precedent that could have national implications and it would trigger potentially significant future costs that would be avoided by simply not building on the land as was originally agreed in fact taxpayers would be subsidizing the levee construction by purchasing the land which would enable the future levee project and the local costsharing partner to avoid real estate fees a costly pattern could develop the federal taxpayer buys the property and a short while later the community opts out of the program and builds a levee on the ``free land we urge you to oppose s 2039 this controversial bill should not have been placed on the suspension calendar and should not be

that out obviously im now in the united states congress but i love the law i love the purpose and value of lawyers and i encourage young lawyers that if they want to read a story of sacrifice and someone who epitomizes that its a jealous mistress read the history of john adolphus payton born in 1946 and passed this past march 22 in baltimore maryland he obviously is from california but with a law degree from harvard law school that means that the world was his oyster and it was open to any manner of choice that he could have made in his lifetime he was a federal clerk but he managed to start his life at wilmerhale which used to be i believe wilmer cutler pickering which is where my husband practiced law here in d c for a number of years what i like most of all is that his reach was so far on the independent electoral commission in south africa again looking for justice president of the district of columbia bar but he found his way to his calling he found his way to answer the opportunities that he was given being a 1977 graduate of harvard law school he stood on the shoulders of thurgood marshall a graduate of howard law school he stood on the shoulders of the giants that graduated from law school in arkansas and the other giants that graduated from howard and i think he found his comfort level at the naacp legal defense fund becoming the sixth president my classmate elaine jones served in that capacity for a very long time graduating from the university of virginia law school today in the wonderful tributes she was part of that wonderful memorial service that was held here in washington d c along with a number of other giants let me just say to you that when we think of justice we have a combination from the civil rights leaders to the fallen dr king on the balcony in memphis tennessee but do we know all the lawyers that were part of the matrix of justice from thurgood who held the hand of dr king and a number of civil rights leaders one after another some of our giant lawyers down in alabama and mississippi who were there to bond them out to petition their case in the likes of those john payton became an unselfish fighter for justice from his what i call victory of richmond v croson in a 54 decisionit was a victorywhere he attempted to maintain the affirmative action plan that established just a simple process of assisting businesses to receive opportunities i want you to know today that because of lawsuits like that we are suffering in cities all around america because there were those who believed that just a smidgeon of opportunity was too much right in my own city of houston under the general services administration that i hope will be cleaned upand i know there are good people therewe have gilbane a major company using stimulus dollars and having no concern about the indepth minority participation of small businessesthe gsa hopeless and helpless at being able to do anythingand having a nondiverse workforce gilbane let the number go out as an example of what john payton was fighting against then of course his valiant fight in 2003 at the university of michigan the affirmative action case that is maintained today as he defended the schools use of race as their admission processesagain not using it destructively that is i think one of the arguments that is not a legal argument but he found a way to justifythe trial court of appeals and the unitedstates supreme court defending undergraduate schools use of race in their admissions processes and the loss in the united states supreme court by 63but in any event maintaining the fight and taking cases that were not popular john thank you thank you gay for sharing him and then a 2009 case northwest austin municipal utility district number one v holder the municipal district in austin my state challenged the validity of section 5 of the voting rights act payton assisted in the arguments leading to the supreme courts 81 decision upholding section 5 he was our firewall on the question of section 2 and section 5 he was the holder of the truth the arbiter the outside partner to the department of justice that wanted and needed to do right finally the local attorney for the plaintiff in 2010 lewis v city of chicago in which a group of african americans seeking to be firefighters contended that they had properly filed a charge of discrimination it is my understanding that that case has moved along and that john prevailed so that truth would be the call of the day it is important to hold him up as the man of armor who is nonviolent and he held as his victory call the constitution and the laws that were passed to help the unempowered ive always said that the voting rights act is not the black voting rights act or the hispanic voting rights act it is the voting rights act to have one vote one person for every single american my hat goes off to john payton and i salute him as a soldier on the battlefield for justice for what is right never wavering with his quiet demeanor and for his strength in the courthouse i ask the naacp legal defense fund to stay the course i ask you to never whimper and never weaken and i say to you that your soldier is going on to be a general in the justice cause in a place beyond i beg of you to carry forward let me just read these citations that were in honor of him just very briefly from a statement from the ldf where they spoke about the city of chicago the lewis case which vindicated the rights of over 6 000 applicants as i indicated that case prevailed they called him fearless a guiding light a brilliant advocate a mentor and a teacher who believed that american democracy thrives when it embraces all of our voices thank you to the legal defense fund and then from one of the major law firms partner walter dellinger had this to say john payton was a towering figure he was just flatout brilliant and combined that intellectual power with a deep and empathetic commitment to justice everyone who knew john will remember forever his infectious good spirit and uninhibited laugh every encounter with john was a learning experience let me close on this note because i know that john would have been in the midst of discussing this travesty of justice as relates to trayvon martin trayvon obviously was a symbol of the injustice of this nation when police and a state prosecutor became judge and jury i dont want to interfere with the process of justice mr zimmerman is arrested but let us not rest on our laurels because we pushed for the arrest that should have been we know that there will be a rocky road proceeding toward holding mr zimmerman accountable more importantly let me make it very clear on the floor of the house that every mode of justice that is needed for a fair trial i support if it is to remove the judge as the defense has asked for let that be considered in an unbiased manner if by chance the prosecution asks for a change of venue because this jury pool in this region will be tainted then so be it but what we must also sayand let me be very cleari as a democrat and i hope my friends on the other side are not afraid of dealing with gun violence and the overuse of guns in america as responsible legislators should be and so to my good friend bill cosby let me say to you that the call has been answered many times there are many bills dealing with gun violence there are many bills to rein in the reckless use of guns the use of the assault weapons the issue of individuals not being checked at gun shows and the gun show loophole it only takes responsible leadership to move it forward and i salute the brady center that will be with us in washington tomorrow for recognizing that there are people who are willing to take a standnot against your second amendment rights god bless you for those rights you have those rights i celebrate those rights but i cannot celebrate the fact that a man that was on the neighborhood watch which is the eyes and ears was walking around with a 9millimeter and shot dead an unarmed helpless 17yearold boy and snuffed his life out because we refused to address the question of everyone being able to carry a gun whether trained or not mr zimmerman was not a police officer and should not have acted as if he was the law the judge and the jury so to my good friends on the floor who will come up after me let me just end my note by saying to john payton in instances like trayvon i know that your voice would have been heard on the civil rights of the question but your voice had been heard through places where many of us were not there and did not know and so i agree and salute the words that were offered in tribute to you by so many of your colleagues certainly these last words that indicate that you were in fact fearless you were in fact a guiding light you were in fact a brilliant advocate mentor and teacher you were in fact an eagle with wings who stood widespread over america and when

territories act of 2012 was introduced by mr faleomavaega my good friend from american samoaand i apologize if i did damage to that i thank him for his work on this issue cigarette trafficking is one of the most lucrative smuggling operations in the united states and around the world it is estimated that illicit cigarettes account for over 10 percent of the more than 5 7 trillion cigarettes sold globally each year here in the united states approximately 4 billion cigarettes sold each year are illicit cigarette smuggling is typically carried out by sophisticated largescale criminal organizations that take advantage of the significant disparity between the taxes levied on cigarettes across the states for example a pack of cigarettes that costs 13 in a hightax state like new york will cost only about 5 in a lowtax state such as virginia these differences create a highly lucrative market for individuals to evade the local sales tax and purchase cigarettes in one locality and transport them to another for resale below the market value criminal organizations are able to make a profit of as much as 1 million on just a single truckload of illicit cigarettes state cigarette taxes in the united states have been on the rise since 1992 and have increased more than 65 percent over this period however the states gross tax revenues have increased by only 35 percent due in significant part to the illicit tobacco trade exploiting the price disparity for a single pack of cigarettes between individual states has proved profitable for criminal networks according to the justice department this illicit activity costs the states and the federal government approximately 5 billion each year this is money that couldand shouldbe put to better use congress took steps to curb the sale of contraband cigarettes with the prevent all cigarette trafficking pact act of 2009 the pact act prohibits the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products over the internet and it made changes to the criminal anticigarette smuggling statutes h r 5934 provides a technical correction to ensure that the criminal prohibitions against cigarette smuggling apply to the unitedstates

am here today because this is the only opportunity to voice my adamant opposition to the tanfrelated resolution of disapproval h j res 118 given the strict closed terms of our debate today my goal here today is to be a voice of reason and certainly a voice of truth in this debate because we are all undoubtedly about to hear an astonishing array of half truths and even lies about the temporary assistance for needy families program or tanfthe lie for example that the tanf program was this raving success that took people out of poverty gave them dignity and put them in good jobs well what it really did was to really kick poor people off the rolls you know under president clinton 1996 when we passed the original tanf bill it was a time of prosperity and those people primarily women who would normally get off the rolls within 2 years found jobs which were readily available but even more primarily women just simply languished in poverty as a permanent underclass despite the creation of the socalled safety net under tanf many many women have languished in poverty and are still in poverty today were not just talking about the poor were talking about deep poverty did you know that between 1996 and 2011 the numbers of unitedstates households living on less than 2 per person per daythe measure of extreme poverty as defined by the world bank for developing nationshas more than doubled from 636 000 to 1 46nearly 1 5million people and that the number of children in extremely poor households has also doubled from 1 4 million up to 2 8 million children living in povertychildren by the way who cannot work we are talking about the poorest of the poor these numbers are startling given that we are talking about the united states of america not some third world country now lets get to the big lie that these resolutions relate to the republicans claim that the work requirements have been gutted under the health and human services guidance these lies have already been debunked by the media by fact check checkers even by the original architects of tanffor example by ron haskins apparently our colleagues find it convenient to ignore the facts but of course we have heard throughout this election cycle that the gop is not going to be dictated by facts sadly im not at all surprised that we are forced to engage in this tanf battle on the house floor i knew that the gop would challenge the administrations proposal at the earliest opportunity but frankly house republicans timing on this could not be worse do you think that the american people are demanding more attacks on the poor from your party this week or that doubling down on a strategy of vilifying the poor is a wise choicetrotting out the mythical lazy welfare queen who doesnt want to take responsibility for her own life who is part of the 47 percent who would rather have a socalled government handout than a job i think that the insistence on considering this bill at this moment in history when we should be considering critical issues like the farm bill for our droughtridden states or the violence against women actor how about this one the american jobs act rather than political message bills is remarkably tone deaf tanf was written at a time when our labor market and our economy were radically different than they are today i didnt support tanf in 1996 but i certainly dont support it now that i have seen what it has done it has become a hollow shell of a safety net program it is not going to be allowed to evolve with the times and it is now nothing short of completely broken tanf recipients have been poorly served by the program which too often locks people into a cycle of poverty through rigid guidelines and red tape while allowing them no access to real opportunity in its current form the program makes it extremely hard to move from welfare to work which is supposedly the goal of the program an honorable goal of the program check this out states can meet their work requirements even if nonezeroof their recipients find a job states are only measured by whether or not recipients participate in certain activities for a set number of hours like if they just job search and never find a job not only are we not moving people from welfare to work in this program but we are not allowing people any opportunity to get the education and training they might need to compete in the labor market or to learn valuable skills we are trapping them in socalled jobsearch activities that are poorly designed and add up to nothing tanf just does not provide real opportunities that could translate into better lives for beneficiaries there are others who are unable to get help at all because the program is not designed to allow them in the door shockingly states are rewarded for simply lowering their caseloads rather than for moving people into jobs there is indeed an incentive for states to create barriers that prevent the individuals and families with the highest need from even participating weve heard the horror stories of people who have been kicked off tanf or who couldnt get in in the first place and of the desperate things theyve had to do to feed and shelter and clothe their children by now those of us who have been paying even the bare minimum of attention realize that the republicans have been playing politics with the obama administrations waiver program and have been playing fast and loose with reality i would venture to guess that every member in this chamber knows the truth that republicans and democratic governors have been requesting increased flexibility in implementing the welfare reform for many years in fact in 2005 no fewer than 29 republican governors asked for increased waiver authority and given my limited time i will only name a few of them we have such socialist governors like mississippi governor haley barbour texas governor rick perry how about arkansas governor mike huckabee and none other thandrum roll pleasemassachusetts governor mitt romney like these governors i wholeheartedly endorse the idea of allowing states the flexibility to craft welfare systems that meet the specific needs

persuaded and minds are changed this frequently happens late at night when members are less concerned about whether folks are watching at home i wish more people would tune in during such nonscripted

tell you that i prefer the majority but either party holding the reins of power should recognize that their grasp is tenuous and thats a good thing both parties benefit by taking turns in the wilderness every now and then over the past 12 years ive offered hundreds of amendments privileged resolutions and points of order in this chamber these offerings most of which were to curb spending were not always successful in fact the vast majority of these offerings resulted in far more red marks next to members names than green marks up on the wall above me but i like to think that we over

answer to leadership on both sides of the aisle to the clerks to the stenographers to the parliamentarians who keep us operating within the rules to the cloakroom staff who keep us fed and remind us

now calling the peoples house so that ordinary people can have a say in what we do and make sure that their opinions are heard so again i would invite anyone and everyone to join me in this conversation to make sure that everyday people have a voice and have a way to contact me so again you can reach me at myidea mail house gov or you can find me on facebook or you can find me on twitter what i want to remind everyone of is the fact that it is very clear that many of us know a lot of things but the most important thing we need to know is that we dont know it all that is why i am soliciting the help of the american people so they can give us their ideas when i started this the last time i was asking them to send me their ideas on ways to cut spending and ways to save money i also was asking for ideas on how to raise some revenue how to make this country the great country that it used to be well the good thing is that we had people who took me up on this idea and to say that they thought that this was a good idea and they wanted to participate they wanted to make sure that people heard their voice they sent me a number of ideas and we are going to talk about some of those ideas and those comments today so my goal here is to again have and initiate a conversation with the american people because this is truly the peoples house the united states house of representatives you cannot be appointed to it you have to be elected and the history behind it is because we are the closest to the american people so now in this day of new technology and all of the outlets and social media that we have in order to strike up conversations in different ways we should do that this is not the day when the only thing we have is the united states postal service or slower means of communication today we can communicate in seconds if not nanoseconds so i want to make sure that we use all of this new medium in order to expand this conversation to everyone who is concerned these are some of the people who responded last week and some of the people whose ideas we will talk about i was very happy to get such a large response and these are some of the people i wanted to point out we had sheila baker who responded robert becker from new orleans who also responded mary anne lawrence cazaubon responded several times through several different media outlets and had some very interesting things to say as well as micah hill barbara olinger from folsom and freddy vazquez jr then through facebook we had adam haney anthony sadler from tennessee phil schlittler and deloris wilson all of whom participated and gave me some of their thoughts about what they thought should be going on i want to make sure that at least the people back in the second congressional district of louisiana understand that they are more than welcome to participate in this conversation but that this conversation is open to the american people there is no monopoly on good ideas although i respect and value the opinions of the people from louisiana in the second congressional district we want to hear from everybody so lets just start talking about some of the ideas i will tell you before i start that i may or may not agree with all of the ideas and some of my colleagues from the republican side or the democratic side may or may not agree the one thing i think both sides will agree on is that this is america and that this is what makes america the great place that it is this is the place where we can provide kids with a free quality public education which will prepare them for the future this is the place where we strive to get the sick the health care that they need even if they cant afford it this is the great country where we take care of our seniors and our disabled with medicare medicaid and social security this is the country where we care for our fellow man and strive to feed the hungry clothe the naked and shelter the homeless tonight i am sharing recommendations on how we as americans get back to that great place of humanity of sacrifice and of prosperity now micah hills comments were very very interesting micahs frustration was the fact that congress should address underachievement in our grade schools he wanted us to address that underachievement by holding parents accountable for their childrens performance ill give you an excerpt from his letter micahs response was children who are not doing well in their studies are children who are constantly in trouble their parents should be investigated the students homes should be investigated to see if the parents are abusing substances or anything else if young students like those in grade school and freshmen in high school are having problems then the parents should be investigated that will help educate our children who are not getting their educational needs met because of their home fronts find out the childs educational strengths and find out what is lacking in the home now micah that is a very creative idea and i think that that conversation has started numerous times back in my state legislature it is a conversation that we should be having at the federal level because when we talk about our childrens success when we talk about their education the one thing that everyone agrees on is the fact that parental responsibility and parental involvement is the single biggest indicator of that childs success so as government if we can help to do anything to make sure that that home life is safe and secure and that that child can succeed then we absolutely should do it and i look forward to continuing that conversation with you i will now touch for a second on mary anne lawrence cazaubon who by the way is 72 and is a retired teacher before her teaching career she worked more than the required quarters in order to draw social security between the two lives that she lived and the two jobs that she worked she now lives on less than 1 150 per month if there were a flat tax of only 10 percent it would cost her roughly 115 per month she says even though she would have to spend every dime of her check every month she would just have to do that she also mentions some months she has to go without food but she always makes sure that she gets her medicine for her heart and her osteoporosis thats the type of sacrifice thats the type of predicament a lot of our families are in ms mary anne went further as she talked about tax and fiscal issues and she was very clear to write this a statement that i absolutely agree with congressman i hope you appreciate the fact that many of your constituents do support limited government and fiscal sanity our country is in real danger of economic collapse please dont just toe the party line and reject solutions to this crucial issue our nations fate depends on it i want to say that i think ms mary anne is absolutely right i think that everyone in the country is calling for limited government and fiscal sanity also i think that we have to recognize at the same time that as we cut and make very prudent decisions to restore our fiscal sanity that we have to invest in this next generation that we have to invest in the future that we have to invest in those things that spur our entrepreneurial spirit and our innovation and in those things that are going to continue to make sure that we are the leader in every industry and in every category that we used to be the leader in after ms mary anne talked about the limited government and fiscal sanity she also volunteered that she would like to see an indexed income tax without any exceptions for individuals or families and no incentives or exemptions to any industry or company large or small here is the recommendation that ms mary anne came up with she would recommend a 0 percent tax for anyone with an income of less than 20 000 5 percent for anyone with income from 20 000 to 40 000 10 percent for any of those from 40 000 to 60 000 15 percent for those from 60 000 to 80 000 20 percent for those from 80 000 to 100 000 25 percent for those from 100 000 to 150 000 30 percent for those from 150 000 to 200 000 and 35 percent for all incomes over 200 000 i think that this is very interesting because were talking about a 72yearold lady who survives on 1 150 per month and she has taken the time not only to watch cspan but to join in the conversation with me and the peoples house to say that she understands that people who make more should pay a little bit more on that note ill go to sheila baker whose quote i think is directly applicable to what ms mary anne was saying ms baker says i pay my taxes responsibly with the understanding that i must pay more than those who earn an income less than mine ms baker is clearly saying that she makes a little bit and she understands that she pays more than the person who does not make what she makes and who is not as fortunate as she is but her next sentence is the most important one she says she also expects and demands that those who earn more than she should do the same and that those who make more than ms baker should also pay their fair share hence the concept of a fair shared burden of taxes so i want to thank ms baker one for acknowledging that she is doing better than other people and that she has to pay a little bit more and i want to thank her for participating in the peoples house and in expressing her concerns and her opinions about where she thinks we should be as a country the next person i want to talk about is freddy vazquez jr he has concerns about our spending he has concerns about foreign aid and he has concerns about the war that we are fighting and he writes we spend billions on helping others and thats fine when we have the means libya pakistan iraq and afghanistan they take our money then they stab us in the back america can and will go bankrupt our government is acting like a teenager who just received a credit card he then goes on to quote 2pac where 2pac said they got the money for war but they cant feed the poor and he closes with thats not rightthats not america and i would just say that the frustration that mr vazquez is expressing here is a frustration that were hearing all across the country the fact that were fighting so many wars on foreign soil the fact that our humanity goes far out immediately people are wondering does humanity start at home do we have obligations to take care of on the home front before we go across the globe doing the same i would just chime in here and add my personal opinion that were america we can do both we can provide here at home and we can continue to be the world leader spreading democracy around this world to make sure that the world is just as great as the free country that we live in now what is it going to take to do that its going to take a shared sacrifice in the last peoples house we talked about american people give what you can giveif youre a high school student mentor an elementary kid if youre a college student help out at a senior citizens home if youre a millionaire then contribute to a charity what makes america great is the fact that we are willing to give what we have to give so i would just implore everyone to give what it is you have the ability to give because thats what made this country what it is today and allowed us to achieve what we were able to achieve i would also add that anthony sadler wrote in to say that he believes we should buy more products from local businesses especially minority businesses anthony i just want you to know that down here today i dont have our minority whip mr steny hoyer but i will tell you that you and steny hoyer are a match made in heaven steny and our democratic caucus are pushing what we call make it in america and if steny was down here today he would go on and on and really get excited about the fact that we will make it in america thats what we dowe make it in everything we do another part of that make it in america we need to make more products in america thats what we dowe manufacture things we build things we have the best innovation but we need to make sure that we have a focus a commitment and an investment in the american people so that they can make it here in america so that goes right with what youre saying mr sadler because as steny will push that we make it in america youre pushing that we buy american products and those two things go hand in hand so mr sadler i just want to thank you for chiming in and im sure that my minority whip steny hoyer is somewhere right now very appreciative of the fact that you also recognize the importance of making it in america now we have ms deloris wilson and phil schlittler who posted on my facebook and both of them didnt post very long messages they both posted the same thing at different times and they simply said that they agree with the presidents rationale not to release the pictures of osama bin ladens body and i just want to say to ms wilson and to phil that i agree with both of you i think the president made the right decision but its very comforting to know that we have citizens like you all that are at home paying attention and simply are not voicing an opinion to get attention but simply a heartfelt belief and it just so happens that i agree with your opinion but even when we dont agree i want to hear from you i want to make sure that we keep this conversation going now the next person is adam haney who i did not know before the first time i did the peoples house but he was watching and this is what he wrote saw you on cspan good job those maniacal republicans want to kill my hopes for class mobility save the safety nets republicans used to get into congress for those of us who want to benefit from those same programs that they did and i would just add adam that there are a bunch of programs out there and those programs are what make this country great and i dont have to talk about the obvioussocial security medicaid medicarewe can talk about head start that gives our toddlers the ability to start school and give them a head start on their future as a country we invest in things we should look at what return do we get on our dollar when we invest in early childhood education we get a 91 return for every dollar that we invest in that child we get 9 back those are the types of programs that adam is referring to when he said that the majority would prefer to cut all of those programs now that they have received it and theyve been the beneficiary of it also we can go back to free and reduced lunch in our public schools we can talk about public school education period the fact that many of us that are lucky enough and honored enough to be members of the united states congress in this 112th congress came from public schools with public school teachers funded by the american people we should hold that very high the privilege that we were able to do that but at the same time we should recognize that that was a sacrifice by generations before us to make sure that it was fully funded we had the quality teachers that we needed so that we could be prepared so that we could prosper and that we could be successful it would be a sin and shameful for us not to invest that same energy same money same commitment into our next generation and im afraid that thats the route that were taking so adam i just want to say i agree with you wholeheartedly the second to last one is robert becker from new orleans who wrote me with an idea about social security and retirement security he said we should increase the amount that is deducted from paychecks to pay into the trust fund and increase the amount employers contribute to the fund it is in americas best interest not to have a great portion of elderly americans living on the edge of poverty not only is it in americas interest robert i will tell you its the right thing to do and at some point we have to remember that while were here on earth its for a purpose and thats to make the world a better place and what youre advocating for absolutely is the right thing to do it makes this country the special country that it is and our last person is barbara olinger from folsom she is from louisiana not in my district but she wrote urging congress to act on social security and related issues specifically she was requesting that we as congress reconsider the social security fairness act of 2009 which would repeal rules related to the government pension offset and the windfall elimination provision she says this reduces her income during tough times she wrote saddest of all is i am a retired social studies teacher american history civics i am so distraught we only ask for what is right and just if i had not ever paid a dime i would not be asking for a dime well ms barbara youre absolutely right you paid into it you should get it you shouldnt be penalized im not too big too arrogant to say sometimes government gets it wrong and government has it dead wrong on this issue and its something that we should address so i want to thank those people for writing in and now i just want to turn for a second to something that is absolutely the climax of foolishness see i have a shipyard in my district called avondale shipyard it used to be northrop grumman then northrop grumman spun it off got a 1 5 billion credit for the asset and they spun it off to a new company that they made huntington ingalls shipyard well huntington ingalls in just the first quarter this year made 45 million but they decided that theyre going to close that shipyard in my district now thats almost 5 000 direct workers that work for huntington ingalls 6 000 indirect jobs well its every american companys right to decide when they want to close a business they can decide its just not profitable they can decide that the heat in louisiana and the humidity and the mosquitos are too much for them that they can quit that theyre going to shut their plant down that is their right and thats what we fight for in this country to give people the right to do what they want to do it doesnt mean i have to like it but government should not be a coconspirator in that companys quitting on the american people so what i have here today i have all of these petitionsand theyre not signed by the workers it would have been far too easy to come in here with a big box of 5 000 signatures from people who depend on huntington ingalls for a paycheck this is from businesses in the community that are saying that its just not right for huntington ingalls to just abandon the community heres the part that rises to the level of the climax of foolishness now that huntington ingalls has decided to close they have applied for the federal government to reimburse them the cost of closing so the federal government is contemplating giving huntington ingalls 310 million to pay for their cost of ramping down and laying off almost 5 000 people to me that just doesnt make good sense we can take that 310 million we can put it in an economic development fund for any other business that wants to come along and create thousands of jobs we can put it in education for those 5 000 employees so that they can be competitive in another occupation we can take that 310 million and pay down the debt we can take that 310 million and do a number of things but i would submit to you that we dont take that 310 million and reward a company for closing i offered that amendment on a bill just a few days ago and some of my republican colleagues supported the idea that we should not reward a company for quitting on 5 000 employees and my democratic colleagues overwhelmingly supported the same amendment i would just tell you that in these tough economic times it is unconscionable to reward a company for quitting for those people who voted against that amendment i would hate to have to go back to montana minnesotasomewhereand say not only did i have an opportunity to take 310 million and give it to paying down the debt or doing something productive with it or even doing something in my district i decided to give 310 million to a company that is going to make 180 million this year and why are we giving them 310 million because theyre closing theyre still going to own the property theyre still going to have the asset they wont have the employees in closing i just wanted to quickly touch on one thing and that is on the last district workweek i had the opportunity to go to the second harvest food bank of greater new orleans they are leading the fight in eradicating hunger last year they served 262 800 people including 82 000 children and 40 000 seniors i just want everyone to know that the problem of hunger homelessness and all of those things in our community is real so as we cut we need to remember to invest again i look forward to continuing this conversation on the

president initiated a strike against libya without consultation from the congress and without prior explanation to the american people then as now we all supported the removal of the regime of libya a regime that was slaughtering and is slaughtering its own people yet rather than seek regime change from the start the president chose to follow not lead and pursued a strictly humanitarian mission under the banner of the united nations with no plan for colonel qadhafis removal so at the outset we asked some very straightforward questions for the president why isnt removing qadhafi a part of this mission what if he doesnt leave who are the rebels that we are there helping to fight how long is this going to last and at what cost and what does success look like these were questions that the administration would not or could not answer under our constitution the commander in chief has the authority to take actions necessary to protect our national security this is an authority which i and this house respect but it does not free the president from accountability to the american people to this congress or to the rule of law now whatever your opinion of the war powers resolution may be the fact is it is the law of the land and simply cannot be ignored so 3 weeks ago this house overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan resolution asking the president to explain how this mission is consistent with our national security goals to justify continuing this operation without authorization he responded by telling us he didnt need congress because there are no hostilities taking place in libya well we soon found out even his own lawyers dont buy that argument now if the commander in chief is going to take our forces into war he must take ownership of it and if the president believes that missile strikes and drone operations taking place in libya are critical it is his responsibility to explain to the american people and to seek authorization from this congress because the president has failed to do that because he has failed to fulfill his obligations we are here today now make no mistake i support the removal of the libyan regime i support the presidents authority as commander in chief but when the president chooses to challenge the powers of the congress i as speaker of this house will defend the constitutional authority of the legislature this bill represents i believe a reasonable approach by allowing our forces to continue playing a limited support role it would not undermine our nato partners it would however prevent the president from carrying out any further hostilities without congress approval and it would exercise congress constitutional power to provide some muchneeded accountability i believe this is a responsible approach and i believe this house should support it"]]}
