for myself and so many others serving in this august body while our hearts are heavy today we honor them for their historic and notable contributions to this nation congressman louis stokes was the first african american to represent the state of ohio in congress where he served for more than 30 years he rose to prominence by breaking numerous barriers as the first in so many areas this included being named the first african american to serve as chairman of the prestigious house permanent select committee on intelligence as an african american who now sits on that committee i am deeply honored to follow in louis stokes footsteps during his tenure on the permanent select committee on intelligence he stepped into the national spotlight as a vocal critic of the reagan administrations foreign policy he spoke boldly on issues of national security and created a legacy of being a fierce advocate for the homeland in honoring his memory we must also commit ourselves collectively to continue the fight to promote diversity within the intelligence community we must also be committed to supporting policies that promote our national security in the face of growing threats it was congressman lou stokes who taught us that our nation deserves nothing less today we also honor an american treasure and one of my personal heroes the courageous mrs amelia boynton robinson mrs robinson passed away on august 26 2015 at the age of 110yes 110 mrs amelia boynton robinson was a key figure in the voting rights movement in selma alabama she is often remembered for her critical role in bloody sunday on that solemn day on the edmund pettus bridge robinson was savagely beaten a photo taken of her shortly after she was attacked and posted in the new york times became a powerful symbol of the injustices suffered by those who were attempting simply to vote yet this tireless fearless foot soldier continued her work as a leader on the front lines of securing the right to vote for all americans amelia is best known as the matriarch of the voting rights movement and it was her courage along with john lewis and so many other known and unknown foot soldiers which led to the passage of the voting rights act of 1965 amelia was such an integral part of the process that the contents of the bill the voting rights bill were drafted on her kitchen table in selma alabama in 1965 ms boynton not only trailblazed as a voting rights advocate she put her money where her mouth was and she herself ran for congress on may 5 1964 amelia boynton broke yet another barrier when she became the first woman in the state of alabama and the first african american woman in the state of alabama to run for congress in 1964 she garnered 10 7 percent of the vote during a time when very few blacks were registered to vote actually only 1 percent of the registered voters were african americans at that time her historic run further solidified her impact on the movement for human rights and voting rights in alabama and in this nation without her courageous campaign for the seventh congressional district of alabama in 1964 i know that my election to this seat in 2010 some 50 years later would not have been possible her sacrifices paved the way for me to walk the halls of congress and i will carry my love and admiration for her in my heart each and every day for i get to do what she could not and that is vote on behalf of the members of the seventh congressional district of alabama for that i am eternally grateful in fact one of my most memorable moments in this chamber is the night that she served as my special guest at the state of the union on january 20 2015 this past year i am grateful for the memories of her greeting president obama that night i am so blessed to not only have called her my constituent but a beloved mentor and friend as she is remembered and she reminds us every day by her life there is still much work to be done finally i would also like to remember the shining legacy of yet another giant figure in the fight for civil and human rights mr julian bond this courageous voice held several titles over the course of his impactful life but he is most remembered for his service as the naacp chairman and the cofounder of the southern poverty law center he was also one of the original leaders of the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc while he was a student at morehouse college he later served in the georgia general assembly for more than 20 years he was first elected to the georgia house of representatives in 1965 however because of his longstanding legacy of fighting white supremacy white statehouse members tried unsuccessfully to block him from taking his seat this brave spirit was undeterred he spearheaded efforts to draft landmark legislation that spoke to the need of blacks in the state of georgia in addition to his time as an eloquent speaker he was a celebrated writer poet television commentator community advocate as well as a communication specialist he did so much for the southern poverty law center to set it on its course and so much for the lives of so many all three of these wonderful giants tell a story a story of how ordinary people can do extraordinary things working collectively we as a nation can achieve amazing heights even if we dont think so as congressman rangels story best exemplified if we just take one step hopefully the lord will give us the strength to take many many more towards that fight for justice and equality in closing i am reminded of what amelia boynton would often say when i and others would come up to her and say we stand on your shoulders we stand on your shoulders well ms amelia boynton was so infamously known for saying after hearing it over and over again get off my shoulders there is plenty of work to be done do your own work is what she said and so i say to my colleagues gathered here tonight my colleagues in this wonderful body called the house of representatives we have plenty of work to do we have plenty of work to do and while we walk in the footsteps of giants such as amelia boynton and louis stokes and julian bond let us never forget that

owners support background checks well i will tell you why it is because they are responsible gun owners and responsible gun owners understand that there is nothing wrong with making sure that a prospective gun buyer isnt a terrorist a criminal a domestic abuser or dangerously mentally ill the supreme court made that perfectly clear in district of columbia v heller the court ruled that while americans have the right to keep and bear arms there are no constitutional problems with laws prohibiting felons and the dangerously mentally ill from carrying guns as a responsible gun owner myself i will never give up my guns and i will never ask lawabiding individuals without a history of dangerous mental illness to give up theirs and like other responsible gun owners i understand that if gun violence continues unabated then eventually we will see laws that place substantial and overly burdensome restrictions on our right to own guns to reduce gun violence we dont need to stop lawabiding citizens who use guns for hunting sport shooting and personal protection from obtaining those firearms we need to stop terrorists criminals domestic abusers and those with a history of dangerous mental illness from getting guns our first line of defense when it comes to making sure that guns dont fall into dangerous hands is to conduct a background check and we know that when used background checks work every day background checks stop more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun but sadly a gaping loophole allows those same felons dangerously mentally ill and domestic abusers to bypass a background check in 34 states all they have to do is go online or go to a gun show that is wrong that is dangerous and that loophole needs to be closed that is why it is long past time for the republican leadership to allow a vote on h r 1217 my bipartisan prosecond amendment bill to require a background check for all commercial gun sales the bill bolsters the second amendment rights of lawful gun owners by making sure that the bad guys cant easily bypass background checks when trying to buy a gun just as important for the safety and security of our country and our fellow americans is h r 1076 bipartisan prosecond amendment legislation to prohibit those who are on the fbis terrorist watch list from being able to legally buy a firearm we should be able to agree that suspected terrorists shouldnt be able to legally buy a gun or guns of their choosing as a responsible gun owner i am fed up with those who are blindly opposed to background checks hiding behind bumper sticker slogans like guns dont kill people people kill people everyone knows that guns dont kill people which is exactly why responsible gun owners and the overwhelming majority of the american people understand that it is important to run a background check to see if the person buying the gun is a danger to our community this debate isnt a choice between respecting the second amendment or reducing gun violence as a responsible gun owner i am tired of it being framed that way it is about this congress doing both the supreme courts heller ruling

years walked away with the weapons they wanted if there is one thing both sides of this house can agree on it is keeping guns from terrorists i know my colleagues on the other side have expressed some concerns so lets address them you are worried that there are names on the list that shouldnt be there this is a legitimate concern so lets scrub the list you are worried that it is difficult to get off the list if you are wrongly put on it this bill has an appeals process you are concerned about denying people their second amendment rights well i am a gun guy i own guns i support the second amendment if this bill did anything to violate those rights my name wouldnt be on it we are not talking about prohibiting lawabiding nondangerous people from getting guns we are just talking about taking a pause i think we can all agree that it is better to err on the side of caution and let people get their names taken off the list rather than just sell them a gun and hope they are not a terrorist so lets scrub the list and make it accurate lets make sure the appeals process is functional and efficient and if someone is on the terrorist list and is denied from buying a gun lets pump the brakes and make sure they are in fact not a terrorist before that sale is allowed to proceed everyone on my side of the aisle stands ready to address your concerns will your side do the same will you address our concern about terrorists being able to have legal and easy access to guns we have a chance to take a simple straightforward step to keep spouses kids and communities safe we can take

prevention task force and in solidarity with the majority of americans who are demanding that congress take meaningful action to prevent gun violence we all know the statistics whether it is through mass shootings that make the headlines or the unseen violence that happens daily on our streets gun violence takes the lives of more than 30 000 of our nations citizens each year a number that far exceeds other industrial countries now all these countries have their share of violent extremists and madmen but only our country gives easy access to weapons of mass killing and that makes all the difference for america rather than seeking out commonsense solutions to address this crisis the republican majority continues to cower to the gun lobby and the firearms manufacturers now they plead the second amendment but constitutional law 101 would tell us that all of our rights including the precious freedoms of religion and speech must be balanced to protect innocent third parties and to protect the safety of the wider community one commonsense measure we should all agree on is background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill you cant shout fire in a crowded theater because of your freedom of speech and neither should you be able to buy a weapon if you have a history of violence and criminality in fact almost 90 percent of americans including the majority of gun owners support universal background checks for all gun purchases the problem is that our present background check system is rife with loopholes background checks are not required for private sales at gun shows they are also not required for internet sales bipartisan legislation has been introduced by representatives peter king and mike thompson that would finally close this egregious loophole it is an entirely sensible reform that would have a measurable impact on the safety of our schools homes and neighborhoods without preventing lawabiding citizens from using guns for selfdefense or recreational purposes despite attracting 186 cosponsors including several republicans the background check legislation has never been brought to the floor or even received a hearing in committee it has been languishing for more than 15 months meanwhile the shootings and the suicides and the massacres continue to accumulate my colleagues we must do better our fellow citizens are totally fed up both with the unspeakable killing and suffering and with a feckless congress that hasnt lifted a finger to prevent it now this week after intense public criticism and a historic protest by democrats on the house floor republicans seemed for a while to be willing to hold a vote on legislation they claim would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms after all nearly 2 500 individuals on the terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in this country but rather than embrace existing bipartisan legislation to actually fix the problem republicans put forth a woefully inadequate proposal that would require law enforcement and courts to grapple with unworkable processes unreachable standards to be completed in an unreasonably short period of time their bill would allow suspected terrorists to receive firearms by default after only 3 days if the court is unable to work through a complicated process that is the same flaw that allowed the white supremacist charleston shooter to obtain the weapon that he used to murder nine people at emanuel ame church in other words the bill is totally inadequate now under pressure from their most extreme members republican leaders refuse to even put this bill on the floor what should be on the floor is bipartisan legislation h r 1076 that would permit the attorney general to block gun sales to suspected terrorists this legislation based on a proposal from the bush justice department would still allow individuals to challenge the government in court to restore their gun ownership rights we dont have to choose between protecting our communities and respecting due process and so we ask our colleagues how much longer must we wait how many more people have to die to move us to act how many more american towns and cities must be added to the constantly growing list of places like orlando and columbine and aurora and charleston and newtown moments of

movement her life and legacy epitomized strength resiliency perseverance and courage the same characteristics that embody the city of selma alabama my hometown where she made such a significant impact amelia boynton robinson was named the only female lieutenant to dr martin luther king jr during the civil rights movement in this role she would travel alongside dr king and often appear in his stead for numerous events and gatherings amelia boynton robinson was also well known for braving the frontline of the selma march on the edmund pettus bridge where she was brutally attacked and left for dead on bloody sunday on march 7 1965 it was the picture of a bloody and beaten amelia boynton that appeared on the front page of the new york times and showed the world the brutality of racism in the fight for voter equality during the violent attacks this heroine never gave up hope hope in an ideal that is all america it is democracy she believed so fervently that all americans should have the right to vote and she was willing to die for it it was the direct involvement of amelia boynton robinson and the foot soldiers who dared to march from selma to montgomery that led to the passage of

district of alabama the seat i am so honored to hold today she garnered 10 7 percent of the vote during a time when very few blacks were registered to vote i know that the journey that i now take as alabamas first black congresswoman was only made possible because of the courage tenacity and faith of amelia boynton robinson last year before mrs boynton passed i was honored to have her as my special guest at the state of the union it was incredibly moving to see members of congress from both sides of the aisle and members of the presidents cabinet line up to greet her and to take pictures with her everyone thanked her for her service to this country even president obama came to talk and thank mrs boynton before he gave his address at the state of the union this picture documents that very time when she got to meet the president of the united states for the first time the memory of that moment will stand as one of the highlights of my time here in congress the symbolism of this picture is not lost on any of us it was truly because of her bravery and the bravery of other foot soldiers who dared to march like our very own colleague john lewis that paved the way for the election of this countrys first black president just a few months later on march 6 2015 she joined hands with our own president barack obama again to retrace the path that she took across the edmund

loved ones stolen away by gun violence and we need to grieve but after that moment of silence we must direct our sadness and our anger into action the problem of violence in communities may seem insurmountable and no single policy will stop every death but we should start by passing commonsense gun legislation supported by the vast majority of the american people we need a vote on legislation

lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic

law and under the standards of care applicable to neonatal physicians this requirement is so broad and the penalties so severeup to 5 years in prisonthat one can only conclude that the real purpose of the bill is to intimidate abortion providers out of service the bill also requires doctors and employees of hospitals and clinics that provide abortion services to report any violations of the bills standard of care to state or federal law enforcement authorities any person who fails to comply with these requirements is threatened with fines and up to 5 years in prison this is not just the doctors but the cleaning crew and the receptionists on top of this the language in this bill completely fails to distinguish between a viable and nonviable fetus which is the constitutional line that separates abortions that may be performed without restrictions from those that may be regulated or prohibited the bills vague and broad mandates combined with severe penalties will effectively intimidate doctors and ultimately drive them away from the abortion practice which appears to be the true intent of this troubling bill this is why so many organizations are opposed to this bill those like the national womens law center the aauw the aclu and physicians for reproductive choice and health in fact the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists which represents 58 000 physicians opposes h r 3504 because it represents a gross interference in the practice of medicine inserting a politician between a woman and her doctor by intimidating doctors and thereby making abortion unavailable as a practical matter abortion opponents seek to accomplish in fact what they have not accomplished in the courts or in public opinion simply put h r 3504 is yet another attack on womens health and rights when the bornalive infant protection act or baipa became law 13 years ago the bills sponsors clarified that the law was not intended to affect abortion practice or a womans right to choose we did not want to constrain or chill medical decisions regarding patient care that is why judiciary committee democrats voted to support it the bill before us today appears to directly contradict those assurances lets not forget that politicians are not doctors we should be concerned about doing our jobs and fully funding highquality womens health care instead of trying to keep doctors from doing theirs i strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous bill i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.009385466575622559, 0.9906145334243774, 1, "we have less than 5

advocate and fight for something that we need to fight for but we have been able to make a difference that is why i come to the house floor this evening to recognize and celebrate a very important anniversary the 1year anniversary of bipartisan comprehensive legislation justice for victims of trafficking act that was signed into law the justice for victims of trafficking act or jvta was a landmark bill as you have heard that updated americas effort to combat the scourge of human trafficking and provided essential resources to survivors and law enforcement officials i am so proud to have had my bill be included in this legislation and to have been able to take part in its drafting passage and enactment in the year since jvtas enactment we have witnessed important achievements for example the jvta has reinvigorated americans commitment to protecting our children from cruel exploitation and these children still need our protection human trafficking as we have heard is an estimated multibilliondollarayear international enterprise that forces the most at risk among us both here at home and abroad into modernday slavery it is one of the fastest growing crimes in the world according to the united states state department human trafficking is among the worlds top three criminal enterprises it is forced prostitution domestic slavery and forced labor which is why enactment and now the implementation of the jvta is so important we must continue to work to eradicate human trafficking and support the victims in the year since the jvtas enactment we have seen educators law enforcement officials and service providers working together democrats and republicans raising awareness in our communities that human trafficking is not merely an international phenomenon it unfortunately happens all too often in our backyards just as we have heard judge poe talk about t and talk about brooke and the stories could go on and on in fact in my home state of ohio for example each year an estimated 1 000 children become victims of human trafficking and over 3 000 more are at risk ohio is the fifth leading state for human trafficking because of its proximity to waterways that lead to an international border and the 175 interstate that allows anyone to exit the state within 2 hours to almost anywhere lastly i am very thankful for having amazing advocates in ohio for victims of human trafficking like theresa flores the founder of soap save our adolescents from prostitution and state representative teresa fedor a member of the ohio house of representatives who has made a lifetime commitment to working to protect our victims we must remain vigilant in the implementation of jvta as we were when we passed it so every child every woman and man is free from this form of modernday slavery which is why i am proud to have joined judge poe and congresswomen wagner and maloney of new york in leading a letter to united states attorney general loretta lynch supporting the department of justices implementation thus far of the jvta and requesting needed information on what more can be done within the confines of the current law this is what

that i can support i strongly believe in encouraging employee ownership through esops options this bill does part we can do a lot more it is a big thing that we can do to address the increasing income disparities that this country has in making sure that workers can participate in capital formation and capital growth along with owners and executives we look forward to working with the gentleman on that bill and contacting the gentleman as well the gentleman from ohio said that somehow legal operating businesses must have access to banking resources the goal of this bill he said oh wait a minute i mean federal ones not state ones not federal not state this is where you have a difference of course you wont have any disagreement that there is an ambiguity here with regard to types of businesses that are legal at the state level and are not legal federally but this is where you will find that most democrats believe very strongly in states rights most republicans believe here with the exception of the other gentleman from california who just spoke and a number of others who would allow a majority to support this bill but apparently the gentleman from ohio believes in an overarching federal definition telling states what they can and cant do indirectly through the banking system effectively constraining their ability to allow banks to serve businesses that might sell types of firearms that are illegal federally or types of marijuana or hemp or other products that might be illegal federally effectively they are arguing that the federal government should tell them what to do and impose a onesizefitsall solution on states that are as diverse as texas and california and colorado and north dakota i disagree with that premise as do most of the democrats here today we feel that while this body of courseand i agree with the gentlemanshould continue with the discussion about the regulatory structure of legal treatment of cannabis products federally that should in no way shape or form stand in the way of a simple fix that says whether you want it to be legal or illegal transactions should be traceable safe through the banking system for businesses that are legal at the state level let me address h r 1675 the encouraging employee ownership act also being named the capital markets improvement act it is a good piece of bipartisan legislation that i think can be made even better through the amendment process title i of this bill which will revise the secs rule 701 by raising and indexing for inflation the threshold under which companies can issue stock to employees without running into government red tape is a commonsense good piece of legislation i hope it is something that most of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree with i am an early cosponsor of this legislation and i think we should promote and applaud the structure the indexation and of course allowing employees to have a stake in their companies that is not the only solution the gentleman from california might have some other ideas i look forward to discussing as do i but if you want to help solve some of our nations issues with income inequality and the wealth gap then we should applaud and promote companies that incorporate employee stock or option ownership whether you issue stock in the manner under this bill or whether you operate in esop or any of the other forms that allow workers to benefit from the growth of your company we should find ways to work together to promote and encourage this style of corporate governance title ii is a safe harbor for investment research a bill that will help improve available market information for investors and something that has broad bipartisan support i know my colleague from delaware will also be pleased to see this pass as an original sponsor my colleague from ohio who is a cochair with me of the congressional caucus for middle market growth spoke yesterday and today about how this overall package of legislation will help grow companies in the allimportant middle market this is main street america these are companies that might not be big enough to be multinational multibilliondollar brand names and they are not startups or small companies but it is the engine of our economy the portion of the market that is a vital piece of our economic engine creating jobs on main street title iii of this bill will work to reduce red tape for these very middle market companies these provisions have broad bipartisan support and i applaud them the sec has largely agreed with this in fact the only argument against it has been we already do this and i think that is a weak argument because we ought to put it in statute the sec has agreed and has taken action but unfortunately some of their actions have added in some increased investor impediments as well i hope the administration can work with congress to improve this bill if there are specific issues they have with it but the bill is necessary it is better to fix things in statute i think that we can work together to reduce red tape to grow small and middlesized companies title v of the bill is another bipartisan piece of legislation that is in line with the sort of regulatory review that we already ask in many agencies it is the sort of good government legislation i think both sides of the aisle can find agreement on and hopefully support now title iv of h r 1675 unfortunately is a bit of a step in the wrong direction and it is something we discussed extensively in the committee yesterday fortunately for this provision there was an open process mr issa and mr ellison have amendments that will be considered that improve the portion of the bill or remove it entirely unfortunately the bill as written is a move away from searchable financial reporting that can be done digitally it is a step away from sortable and downloadable formats it is a return to the pen and paper and inefficient world of the 20th century rather than a step forward to the open data transparency world of the 21st century across the board market participants investors and regulators want information that is already requiredwe are not talking about any new requirementsinformation that is already required financial information to simply be available in a digital searchable format that is all we seek to preserve and not eliminate it is an odd and outdated use of government resources to deal with this information by hand by pen by paper it puts investors and others at an enormous disadvantage and it prevents and reduces the amount of information in the marketplace searchable and sortable data can be better used to track trends find anomalies find investment opportunities and help regulators notice trouble spots in markets and hopefully catch the next enron before it explodes just as importantly investors need information so do entrepreneurial folks who want to take this information and package it in new and interesting and exciting ways and sell it on to institutional and individual investors we heard yesterday from detractors who said investors arent asking for this information we also heard that the committee didnt include any investors in their testimony they only included operating companies i am not sure who they are speaking for but in my conversations i have never heard any investor say i want less information or i want information to be harder to search or find no investor says i want to know less about a companys earnings i want it to be in an archaic pen and paper format that argument that this information isnt welcome by investors is simply incorrect and it is counter to anything you will ever hear from anyone in the investment community hopefully we will fix these issues through amendment overall i believe this package should merit serious consideration and support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle h r 766 the financial institution customer protection act does address a very important issue and that is the inexcusable actions of operation choke point which at best could be described as an overzealous use of the department of justices power or at worst as a pernicious attempt to root out activities that are determined to be politically unpopular unfortunately as we examine this bill it looks like it has some unintended consequences which are not addressed through the amendment process the amendment process also fails to include a simple amendment that would further the goals of this bill with regard to the regulated marijuana industry in 22 states i hope that we can address the operation choke point issue i hope we can prevent this administration and future administrations from engaging having doj engage in this kind of troublesome use of authority to coerce closures of accounts for otherwise legitimate and legal customers of local financial institutions if a bank or credit union has a legal business it is legal in the state they deem it creditworthy they are a good customer and they want to open an account with them they should be able to serve that customer the federal government should not use the bank itself as an intermediary in a dispute if the doj has a dispute with a banks customer that should be resolved between the doj and the customer not the bank i hope that there is groundwork for bipartisan legislation in this area that can ensure that this president and future presidents and the future department of justices do not abuse their authority in this area one reallife everyday issue where this concept comes up of the department of justice and the federal government interfering with the bank working with its legal customer would have been addressed by the perlmutter amendment that i spoke about earlier it is not just a colorado issue frankly if this bill addressed that issue despite it being overarching in other areas i would probably support it thus is the importance of this issue from local law enforcement in our state but unfortunately not even a minute not even a second of debate is allowed on the issue the gentleman from ohio claimed that we were having that debate to be clear we are not we are debating the underlying rule there is no time for the sponsors of the amendment to make their case or for opponents of the amendment to make their case we are outlaying the time for other amendments many amendments have 10 minutes many amendments have more there is not even a second for the debate of that amendment sponsored by mr perlmutter that is why i cannot support this rule 213 million americans live in a state or jurisdiction where the voters have allowed for some legal marijuana use colorado tried to solve the problem locally but we were rejected by federal banking regulators in courts so congress needs to be the one to make this change only congress can address this issue while there remains a need to align federal and state laws while the doj and treasury have issued some guidance some institutions are providing banking services to the doj and treasury guidance issues the guidance does not solve the problem which is why we need to change the law and provide certainty which this very simple amendment that has bipartisan support and likely would have passed on the floor would have done but it is completely shut down under this rule even

aliens who pose a danger in public safety before they are released into our communities prior to that programs establishment 377 jurisdictions refused to honor some or all of ice detainers but as of early this year 277 of those jurisdictions or 73 percent have now signed up to participate in that program by responding to ice requests for notification honoring detainer requests or both so the

to be transparent in providing information to parents at the beginning of the school year on mandated assessments the students will have to take during the school year and any school district policy on assessment participation as a former teacher and elementary school principal i have seen firsthand the damage caused by the pervasive overuse of highstakes standardized testing for the sake of our students and our education system we need to move towards a more balanced form of assessment that effectively measures diverse kinds of success in teaching and student learning unfortunately h r 5 fails to address schools excessive dependence on deeply problematic standardized tests as someone who has dedicated decades of my career and my life to my students and their success i can tell you that teachers do not join the profession to teach to the test yet more and more educators are forced to spend time preparing students for tests administering tests and reviewing the results of those tests by some estimates almost onethird of a teachers time is spent preparing students to take standardized tests this is unacceptable that is why this amendment is so important by providing parents with information about the standardized tests their students will be taking and providing them with the policies regarding student participation we begin to hold the system accountable for the dramatic overuse of these tests it is time to end this practice of toxic overtesting that is why i support this amendment and ask all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment i yield back

encourage and incentivize bilingual education for our students across the country specifically my amendment would establish a grant program at the department of education to provide resources for states to create or to expand state biliteracy seal programs to recognize high school seniors who achieve a high level of proficiency in writing reading and speaking in english and in a second language students who speak more than one language have a competitive edge in the american job market as businesses look to expand into overseas markets and serve a wider range of customers and as the world becomes increasingly interconnected the demand for students with valuable language skills is increasing it is not only the private sector that needs young people with language skills the federal government also has a direct and compelling interest in ensuring that our young people become proficient in foreign languages our military our diplomats and our intelligence agencies are increasingly seeking to recruit young people with proficiency in a foreign language however there are few state or national standards for bilingual certification for high school students and many students who could qualify for the seal are not enrolled in ap or baccalaureate classes either because they cannot afford the cost of the test or their school does not offer advanced courses whereas states that have or are in the process of implementing state seals do so free of charge for every student i must add that eight states have already approved a bilingual seal and three more are considering it as we speak a biliteracy seal is a very special marker on a students high school diploma it serves as a certification by the state that the student is fluent and literate in a language other than english under my amendment these seals would be available to students who are proficient in any spoken languagearabic mandarin spanish my amendment also makes nonspoken languages like american sign language and braille also eligible to receive a seal a high school senior must have a strong academic record in both english and a second language and he must be on track to graduate my amendment establishes a

and my colleague congressman scott garrett who is my republican cochair of the payer state caucus which is a group of members opposed to the massive transfer of wealth between one set of states to another this amendment is a very simple one that would prohibit any of the funds in this bill from being used in the experimental program to stimulate competitive research otherwise known as epscor epscor was started in 1978 as an experimental program in the hopes of strengthening research infrastructure in areas of the country that receive less than their fair share however defined as a scientist and as an american i think this goal is commendable but the implementation of this programand in particular the formulas used to earmark grants to a specific set of statesis absurd the ability to participate in epscor opportunities is based solely on whether or not a state has received less than 0 75 percent of the nsf research funding in the previous 3 years let me reiterate that the department of energys epscor eligibility is determined by how much nsf research funding a given state has received in the previous 3 years there is no rational basis for earmarking a grant program in one area of spending based on the spending in another unrelated program moreover because epscor considers the funding on a perstate basis rather than on a per capita basis it has devolved into just another one of the many programs that steers money into states that already get far more than their fair share of federal spending epscor is emblematic of a larger problem we have in this country every year hundreds of billions of dollars are transferred out of states that pay far more in federal taxes than they receive back in federal spendingthe payer statesand into states that receive a lot more federal spending than they pay back in taxesthe taker states in the case of illinois our economy loses 40 billion a year because we pay far more in federal taxes than we receive back in federal spending as for my colleague from new jersey his state on a per capita basis has it even worse this alone is responsible for the fiscal stress in both of our states this is an enormous and
