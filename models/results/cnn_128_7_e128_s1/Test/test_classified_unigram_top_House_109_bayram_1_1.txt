fiscally conservative democrats that are concerned about the state of affairs in america we are concerned about the debt the deficit the budget and we are committed to trying to restore some common sense and fiscal discipline to our nations government and our nations budgeting process ever since i was a small child growing up in prescbtt emmet and hope arkansas i always heard it was the democrats that spent the money and yetit was a president named bill clinton from arkansas from my hometown of hope arkansas in fact that gave this nation its first balanced budget in 40 years from 1988 through 2001 america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having its fiscal house in order america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having a balanced budget it is hard now to believe that from 1998 through 2001 this country had a balanced budget because as we all know for the sixth year in a row this nation under this republicanled congress and under this president this administration has given us the largest budget deficit ever ever in our nations history for a sixth year in a row as a matter of fact as you walk the halls of congress it is easy to spot a fiscally conservative democrat because the 37 of us who belong to the blue dog coalition have this poster outside our office in the halls of congress as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 365 525 832 151 and some change that is a big number let us put it in a way that we all can understand it for every man woman and child including those born this 1ast hour every citizen of americas share of the national debt is 28 000 and some change where i come from very few of my constituents can afford to write a check for 28 000 and yet it is this kind of debt this kind ofdeficit that we are saddling on our children and grandchildren and expectingther someday to pay back and i believe it is morally wrong i raise these issues because you see my grandparents left this country better than they found it for my parents and my parents left this country better than they found it for my generation and i believe we have a duty and an obligation to try and leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for the next generation but instead for the sixth year in a row we have the largest budget deficit ever inour nations history this administration this republican congress continues to pass tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year just in the last few months this congress passed the socalled budget deficit reduction act here is~what it did it cut medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor disabled and elderly it cut student loans and a program for orphans to the tune of 40 billion and then they passed another tax cut to the tune of about 90 billion i was not real good in math in high school or college but you can do the math on that some 90 billion in tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year 40 billion in cuts to medicaid to orphan programs and to student loans that amounts to 50 billion in additional debt and yet the republican leadership in this body had the nerve to call it the deficit reduction act i believe it is time for those of us in the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition to rise up and hold this administration this congress responsible for these kinds of reckless spending habits that destroy future generations the budget the president has submitted for fiscal year 2007 some 2 8 trillion you have to givelit to him he has managed to cut all of the programs that matter to people health care education infrastructure economic development and yet give us the largest budget deficit ever in our nations history all at the same time how does he do that because he continues to propose to borrow money from foreign lenders foreign central banks foreign investors to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year what has it given us it has given us a debt of 8 365 525 832 151 by the time we complete this hour the national debt will have risen more than 41 million every tuesday night those of us in the blue dog coalition we are 37 members strong we come here to talk about the debt and the deficit and what it means not only to todays generation but to future generations because you see these are big numbers they are big numbers but let me put it in perspective not only is our nation borrowing about a billion dollars a day we are sending 279 million every day to iraq but do not dare ask the president how he is spending it or if he has a plan for how it is to be spent because he will tell you that you are unpatriotic some 57 million is going every day to afghanistan and on top of that our nation is spending the first half a billion we collect in your tax money each and every day simply to pay interest not principal just interest on the national debt we need 149 in my congressional district i need 1 5 billion to complete it give me 3 days interest on the national debt i can build 149 on the eastern side we are waiting on 169 give me 3 days interest on the national debt and i can complete 169 and with these two interstates we can bring economic opportunities and jobs to one of the most depressed and distressed areas of the country these are the kinds of priorities that should be americas priorities that continue to go unmet until we get our nations fiscal house in order and restore some

they have to balance their budget and so when they balance the budget what do they do raise tuition costs they cut dollars going to local governments and local governments then have to put a penny

understand what is happening in the present wedo not even have to go as far back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the

you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a bipartisan way and

fiscal year of 2006 and with no budget in place for fiscal 2007 i commend my distinguished democratic colleagues on the budget committee for takingthis time to call americas attention to the fiscal challenges resulting from the republicans misguided policies and the wrong choices they have made for our economy misplaced spending priorities and bad decisions have consequences they are leading us further down the path to fiscal ruin and expanding the wedge between middleclass families and the superwealthy i am proud to join my colleagues to highlight the hypocrisy of the overriding republican economic philosophy that extending dividends capital gains and other tax cuts for millionaires and corporations create a rising tide that lifts all boats five years after the presidents 1 5 trillion tax cut our national debt now approaches 10trillion if our tax cuts performed as promised by those across the aisle an exploding economy would have wiped out this debt we have already proven that more needs to be done than just hope that sooner or later tax cuts will reach americans who need help the most but those who do need help must get in line and hope that the benefits of tax cuts for millionaires and corporations will ultimately trickle down to them perhaps the expanding gulf between the haves and the almosthaves is best illustrated by the fact that wages and salaries now make up the lowest share of gross domestic product since the government began keeping records on that in 1947 while corporate profits continue to break alltime records meanwhile the buying power of the minimum wage has sunk to its lowest level in 50 years what is missing are policies that ensure that the benefits of higher corporate earnings productivity and globalization are widely shared such as real government support for higher education a progressive tax code and affordable health care when choices are made at the expense of our safety net choices that benefit the top 1 percent who will never struggle to pay a mortgage never struggle to keep up with gas prices never struggle to put their children through school it is clear that a new direction for our economy is long overdue how can the republicans argue that this economy is bound in the right direction when our nation is saddled with recordbreaking deficits over 4 consecutive years combined with deep and painful cuts to hospitals to schools and to security at least the republicans budget outlook since 2001 has been consistent americans could bank on the american budgets to slash funding for proven homeland security programs veterans benefits education and health care priorities all the while cutting taxes for millionaires who need the break the least as reallife indicators of poor federal spending choices such as stagnant wages soaring crime rates and rising health care premiums and drug prices begin to take their toll on americans it is our responsibility to react instead inaction reigns under the direction of the current leadership in some cases this inaction has yielded to halfhearted solutions such as an energy bill that does more for oil aild gas companies than lower gas prices a medicare bill that does more for drug companies and hmos than make lifesaving drugs affordable a pension bill that takes it easy on corporate boards while ignoring the decline of traditional defined benefit plans eleven days away from the start of the fiscal year the record of this republican congress on the economy shows that we have not completed a budget or a single appropriations bill fiscal irresponsibility has reached unprecedented new lows depending on how you look at it the debt limit has been raised for the fifth time in as many years to almost 10 trillion perhaps we shouldnt be worried after all the presidents budget director said last month that 200 billion annual deficits are sustainable indefinitely apparently normal budget rules dont apply to this administration but they do apply to a middleclass family of four living on long island whose monthly costofliving expenses due mostly to rising gas prices and health care costs are rapidly exceeding wage increases perhaps their creditors and collection agents will understand that outstanding debts owed by families sinking deeper into red ink are sustainable indefinitely we can fix this mess we have the blueprint a new direction for america and we only need to look to past and proven methods like the payasyougo budget rules that were enforced in the previous administration and produced surpluses that helped us start buying down our national debt indeed we democrats resolve to restore what should be the goals of our federal budget to reflect the priority of our nation to build a strong economy and to set policies

deserve a clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that today so i urge my colleagues to reject this rule i reserve the balance of my time"]],

to the lead republican sponsor of this legislation the gentleman from california who has worked in a very strong bipartisan way to bring this bill to the floor i commend him for that i also want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the committee on financial services the gentleman from ohio and the gentleman from massachusetts and the other cosponsors of the bill from both sides of the aisle for their support and help with bringing this bill before the house the bill before us is largely technical in nature and seeks to address a change in market practices not anticipated by the original fair debt collection practices act or fdcpa the bill addresses a conflict between the disclosure requirements of the real estate settlement procedures act or respa and the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa this conflict only applies to a limited number of companies that act as both mortgage servicers and collectors of mortgagerelated debt section 6 of respa requires that any entity that is assigned or acquires servicing rights to a mortgage must notify the borrower of the transfer of mortgage servicing the new entity must identify itself as the new loan servicer and disclose to borrowers thatthey have the right to dispute or obtain additional information about the terms of the debt being transferred section 807 part 11 of fdcpa requires that any person seeking to collect a debt must identify themselves in any initial communication as a debt collector identify the debt to be collected and notify the debtor of their right to validate the debt and other protections provided by fdcpa since mortgage servicers often acquire servicing rights for entire portfolios of loans a number of loans are likely to be in default at the time of transfer subsequent efforts by the acquiring servicer to collect on the defaulted debts have at times been thwarted on technical grounds with claims that the collection effort violated fdcpa this is so because the initial communication received by the debtor was the notice of servicing transfer rather than the required notice of debtor rights the compromise that was negotiated 3 years ago to address this problem and which the house has previously passed under suspension would create a narrow exemption from the requirement to provide a notice of debtor rights under the fdcpa for a mortgage service who

such as gps locators atomic clocks and navigation systems it is true this year as in preceding years that research conducted at such wellrespected universities such as mit harvard and caltech has

foundation in 1900 since that time both institutions have served a similar purpose in supporting research that produces in the words of dr alfrednobel the greatest benefit to mankind nist with its

operations i hope that we will remember that feeding the hungry healing the sick and helping those left homeless by natures fury can play an important role in making the united states more secure and more respected by the rest of the world again i thank my colleagues for their work on this important legislation and offer my wholehearted support"], [0.001986861228942871, 0.49801313877105713, 1, "i rise today in support of defeating the previous question so that w may offer a proposal to ensure that americas ports remain safe as we all know a company owned by the government of the united arab emirates is attempting to purchase another company that runs several port terminals throughout the united states even though the law requires an extra 45 days to investigate a contract like this if there is even a chance that it could threaten national security the bush administration chose to approve the deal without the extra investigation the administration approved the deal even though we now know that a classified coast guard report said the deal might be a security risk the president and the uae company have now voluntarily agreed to an extra 45day investigation but that is no longer good enough we simply can not trust this administration to get it right if we defeat the previous question we will offer a bipartisan bill that i have introduced along with chairman of the homeland security committee peter king giving congress the authority to prohibit the deal if the president decides to let us go forward when the investigation is over an extra provision has been added to chairman kings bill to ensure that congressional leadership cannot prevent congress from taking action the uae deal is just further proof that we cannot get our port security right with this administration the 9 11 commission said that the threat to our ports is as great if not greater than the 9 11 attacks and how has this administration responded it has not dedicated enough personnel and resources to the two programs csi and ctpat that are designed to secure our ports as a result highrisk container shipments enter the unitedstates unchecked it has not created standards for container security to keep terrorists from tampering with our cargo it has only deployed radiation detectors to equip 25 percent of the nations seaports it only screens about 6 percent of the cargo that comes into this country we have a problem our ports are not secure by defeating this measure we will give an opportunity for this congress to vote on securing our ports"], [0.002443760633468628,

exceeds the sum or value of 5 million excluding interests and costs and at least one proposed class member and one defendant are citizens of different states or countries for purposes of the citizenship element of this analysis s 5 does not alter current law thus a corporation will continue to be deemed a citizen of any state by which it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business however the bill provides that for purposes of this new section and section 1453 of title 28 an unincorporated association shall be deemed to be a citizen of the state where it has its principal place of business and the state under whose laws it organized this provision is added to ensure that unincorporated associations receive the same treatment as corporations

he certainly was right we had a week when we were back in our districts doing things locally i was thinking when i was listening to the gentleman from ohio about three events that i attended in the last 48 hours in my district or nearby which point to this whole idea of what is good and what is the republican leadership and what is president bush doing because all i hear are complaints about his policies for example on sunday i went to a senior complex for a group of seniors that were meeting in lakewood new jersey which is a community just outside my district it used to be in my district until redistricting a few years ago what i heard was how expensive it is for seniors to buy their prescription drugs and how they did not feel that the presidents new program which goes into effect in january was going to help them in any way one gentleman in particular i remember was one of these guys who was essentially forced into early retirement and promised a fairly generous health care plan that included prescription drugs what he has found since he retired is that every year the cost goes up and the whole agreement if you will that was initially set out has essentially made it so he really cannot afford to buy the prescription drugs even though he has the coverage under a plan for his early retirement the other seniors were talking how the federal government should negotiate price reductions like they do for the va or the department of defense my answer was that is what the democrats wanted to do the reason it did not become law was because the republicans opposed it hi remember in the committee on energy and commerce i had an amendment that would have required negotiated prices by the medicare administrator and it was defeated on a party line vote the bottom line is republicans are so aligned with lobbyists and the cronyism they do not want to do anything that is going to be helpful to the average person this prescription drug bill is a perfect example in addition all the seniors were saying as of october 1 all these different private drug plans are being promoted on television and they have no idea what they are all about i said be very very careful do not sign up for these things until you really look at the details because they may not be helpful to you"], [0.0043680667877197266, 0.4956319332122803, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding if the gentleman is bringing up statewide office holders in ohio for credibility purposes i think the gentleman should probably review the political situation in ohio and some of the stature that some of those folks hold right now if you are making an argument to support your side of the case there are a number of them that are lets say not at the height of popularity as we speak here today but just to mention a couple of things that the gentleman touched upon especially the environmental concerns for example there is nothing in this bill that would prohibit the protection of land for environmental health and safety reasons however if the land is so regulated as to deny the owner any use of it then yes the owner needs to be paid just compensation the fifth amendment does not have an exemption for environmental laws or any other laws in fact the best approach would be to purchase the land possibly through eminent domain rather than trying to pull a fast one and harm the property owner or take that persons property without just compensation the basic idea is that individual property owners should not bear all of the costs of protecting our communities a few land owners should not have to sacrifice their own land and economic well being for the betterment of a town or a city rather the town should give them just compensation that is what we are supposed to do in this society if we are taking it from a particular individual and they cannot use their land as they want to see fit the rest of us through the appropriate way should give them just compensation the fifth amendment should apply in all taking cases and we should not be carving out exceptions when it comes to public health and safety just like in the kelo legislation we passed we did not carve out exceptions for the private use of eminent domain because some property is not as desirable to the community at large all property should be treated the same and if there is public health or environmental needs to take the land owners should be compensated for its taking there are limits to what the government can do and that limit is called the bill of rights when the government takes private property owners must be fairly compensated fortheir land"]]}
