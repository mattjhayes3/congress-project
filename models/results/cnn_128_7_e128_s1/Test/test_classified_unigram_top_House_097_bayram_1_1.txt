crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski president polishamerican congress the honorable francis j meehan ambassador to poland the honorable william wilson the presidents personal envoy to the holy see and peter s bridges director eastern

of detroit who was accompanied by the reverend stanley milewski chancellor of orchard lake schools orchard lake mich mrs helen zielinska president of the polish womens alliance and mr joseph drobot president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent solution to its most difficult internal problems"], [0.010349463671445847, 0.010349463671445847,

full implementation of the presidents program for economic recovery the pressing need of the american people for significant substantial and permanent tax relief can hardly be overstated the tax burden borne by the average american has increased by 249 percent over the past decade federal tax receipts as a percentage of gnp are at a level unmatched since world war 11 inflation is driving millions of hardworking citizens into tax brackets traditionally associated only with the very wealthyto the benefit solely of the federal treasury in addition to budget reductions tax relief was the key ingredient of the economic platform on which president reagan swept to victory last fall the presidentk economic program remains overwhelmingly supported today and only the conablehance substitute fully reflects the principles of long term tax reduction expected by the vast majority of our constituents before elaborating further i should make clear the fact that in many respects both conablehance and the ways and means bill provide for important changes in the tax code in similar fashion for example each bill proposes an easing of the marriage tax penalty an increase in the foreignearnedincome exclusion savings incentivesincluding an expansion of iras and keogh plansa much needed reduction in estate mid gift taxes and business tax incentives i have long advocated such legislation and am pleased that the members of the house have agreed at long last to address these crucial issues in the area of personal income tax reduction however the conablehance bipartisan substitute is clearly preferable it provides for a 25percent reduction over 3 years while the ways and means committee has recommended only 15 percent over 2 years with the misleading promise of a third year based on an unachievable trigger further conablehance assures that beginning in 1985 individual income tax rates will be indexed to inflation this is the reasonthat the bipartisan substitute alone provides for real permanent tax reduction social security tax increases already mandated and bracket creep caused by inflation will result in a 22percent tax increase tor the average family over the next 2 years it is clear then that the democratic plan would not even keep pace with increases over the next 2 years already built into the tax system only the bipartisan substitute provides real and certain tax reduction only the bipartisan substitute guarantees through indexing at the end of the 3year period over which the 25percent tax cut is made that taxes will not automatically increase purely because of inflation in the future i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting legitimate long term tax reductiontax reduction which will get the economy moving again i

the committee bill as well as all of the other proposals which will be offered as substitutes will return hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenues back to the american people returning money to the taxpayers is a noble goal and one which i enthusiastically support however i cannot and will not support a measure which returns hundreds of billions of dollars to the taxpayers in a haphazard and sometimes irresponsible manner the ways and means committee bill is being presented as an alternative to the presidents original tax proposaland to the bipartisan substitutewhen in fact it is not an alternative tax policy at all the bill is more properly described as a political document and a classic example of political horse trading logrolling and halfeffective tax symbolism the ways and means committee took the sound comprehensive economic policy inherent in the presidents 51010 acrs tax program and turned it into a highly ornamented christmas tree the glitter and attractive ornaments got the attention but very little consideration was given to the basic economic foundation bailing out certain socalled distressed industries would be far less objectionable if the rest of our industrial base had already been made healthy and productive through economic stimulus providing increases in the negative income tax we call the earned income credit might be more accepti ble if it did not involve increasing the taxes of the millions of already overburdened taxpayers who are forced to subsidize this benefit unfortunately the majority members of the ways and means committee must have lost sight of the original goals behind this tax bill and instead reported a political document which they hoped could prevail they were forced to bend their bill toward the presidents proposal for the same reason nonetheless their bills ultimate value to the economy is highly questionable some of the provisions in the bill reflect the committee attitude of finding an alternative proposal at any cost one of the other chief offenders in the bill is the committees depreciation proposal which was hastily dreamed up and tossed into the bill as a means of finding an alternative to the acr5 program that the president had proposed the acr8 1053 proposal had been the subject of intense scrutiny over the past few years by some of the finest economic and financial minds in the country it had been drafted and redrafted until a final proposal was developed which most experts agreed would provide almost all of the incentives necessary to rebuild our industrial base and return life and vigor to the economy instead of taking the advice of almost all of the witnesses that teatified before the committee in favor of the acrs concept the ways and means bill relies on a new and untested expensing proposal it is not a bad idea but this proposal is so untried that its provisions were changed almost every time the committee sat down to mark up the bill because it is so untested it is difficult to find anybody in industry that can testify as to how it will affect various industries and regions sometimes i think that the president should have offered the text of the committee bill as his original proposal that way in its quest for an alternative tax program the ways and means committee might then have passed a bill like conablehance as its own bill the country would then be able to look forward to the next decade as an era of sound economic and tax policy instead of approaching the coming years with trepidation as to what lies ahead for the health and stability of our entire economy there is a good deal more to distinguish the presidentially endorsed bipartisan conablehance amendment from the ways and means committee bill than a third year of individual tax cuts the permanentization of those cuts or a skewing of the cuts but those are the major differences that have dominated all the discussions on thisdebate i believe the conablehance alternative is superior specifically because it preserves the third year of tax cuts and then perpetuates them through indexing it provides a real tax cut over 3 years the committee bill because of bracket creep and social security will acutally cause taxpayers to pay more taxes after 3 years than they pay today it is not a tax cut at all we have been told that the conablehance amendment favors the rich the democratic party line alleges the committee bill is better for people with 50 000 of income or less i will readily admit that the committee tax cuts are skewed they are not acrosstheboard cuts which i favor and most of america favors but how much do they favor middleincome people under the committee bill a 15 000 wage earner with a family of four will do better in the first year 1982 by less than 2 a month the 20 000 earner with the same family situation by less than 3 a month when income rises over 35 000 for this kind of taxpayer the conablehance amendment will be more favorable even after 2 years so much for generosity our thimbles runneth over more important than the fact that the income level skewing is minimal is the fact that everybody comes out better under the conablehance bill in the third year as the president has said the committee bill is better only for those who plan to live only 2 years so if any member of this body has been planning to vote for the committee bill because it is so much better for middleincome people he or she can now safely change their plans the presidents plan is better the few pennies a month that it delivers represent an insignificant difference from the straightforward and fair acrosstheboard tax cuts of conable hance however if members are curious as to where the committee version puts the money that it admittedly takes away from higher income taxpayers let them be aware that the democrat bill sweetens the earned income tax credit by nearly 2 billion over the first 3 years the members may recall the earned income tax credit goes to people who pay almost nothing to begin with or who are not even taxpayers at all if we want to help people who pay no taxes at the expense of those who pay most of this countrys tax bills we probably should support the committees tax bill some members may like the 3 billion given to the largest companies in america under the bailey bailout if we vote for the committee bill we can deny our constituents a third year of the tax cut and give the money instead to such distressed companies as general motors ford international paper united states steel southern railroad standard of ohio and scads of other large profitable companies the members own taxpayer constituents will be interested to hear why we reduced their tax cut to give to the largest and most powerful corporations of this country and if some members still like the committee bill i invite them to consider how we are going to explain to our constituents that we are only cutting their taxes by 15 percent but we are cutting the maximum trx rate for exxon and ibm and other giants by nearly 30 percent those are some of the reasons to vote against the committee bill there are plenty of additional reasons to vote in favor of the coneblehance bipartisan substitute a number of members have stood in this well and told us that the committee bill is better for the small business remember that the largest small business organization in the world strongly and unequivocably supports the conablehance amendment remember too that the cuts in conablehance are real and they are permanent the bill is fair the cuts are made across the board they effectively provides stimulus to those healthy growing companies in our industrial system on which we are going to have to depend conablehance does not bail out the cripples it helps those who are going to provide us new jobs in the future the bipartisan subsitute presidents total economic program the final and perhaps most dominant reason of al to support it is that our constituents want us to vote for this bill the telephones in our offices have been jammed with calls since the presidents speech average americans are calling and telling us that we ought to be supporting the president they know his tax cut fits the presidents comprehensive economic programn now that we have adopted our tight budget and supported it by the reconciliation a vote for the conablehance amendment is the next step we must take to turn this country around to make a real change in america to give people who work and save and produce a fair return and to build more jobs and

today we can put the capstone of our efforts into place by approving the administrations bipartisan tax package and by giving this administration a chance to do that which the voters asked itand usta do last november my decision to support the bipartisan tax package came only after a long and thorough scrutiny of the facts of the situation i kept my options open until all cards had been laid on the table and in the end i decided to support the administrations plan for several key reasons first the acrosstheboard cuts in marginal income tax rates and the timely removal of present tax penalties on investment income will generate badly needed savings among middle and higher income earners second the bipartisan package will increase the takehome pay of all workers over a 3year period while easing the burden of inflation third the plan through accelerated depreciation will generate more cash flow for industry and will stimulate increased development in newer more productive plants and equipment finally the bipartisan plan recognizes the contribution of small businesses to our economy and it includes several measures to strengthen their position the turning point in my deliberations over this crucial vote however came when i saw that the administrations proposal is the best plan for the average american worker and hence the people of my home state of maine and the northeast region of the country all of us have been inundated with information on this facet of the taxcut bills and we have heard each side proclaim its bill as the friend of the worker this aspect is important to my constituents because theyare by and large hard work~ers who earn only moderate incomes with this in mind i studied the two plans before us today i saw that social security increases under president carter and inflationfueled tax bracket creep will total about 22 percent for the average family in the next 2 years i then saw that the democratic plan calls for only 15 percent in tax cuts during that period an amount which will not cover these builtin hikes i asked myself if i could in good conscience tell my constituents that i had voted them a tax cut after supporting the democratic plan and i determined that i could not i also heard the claims from the other side of the aisle that their tax cuts are directed toward moderateincome groupsthose with average incomes between 10 000 and 50 000 per year under the administrations package this income bracket which now pays 72 percent of the personal income taxes collected by the federal government will receive 74 percent of the tax cut savings i find this equitablemuch more equitable than tax increases of 400 billion forced on the american people over the last 10 years while we simultaneously gave lip service to five socalled tax cuts one source of particular pride to me concerning the administrations bill is the fact that my colleagues and i on the small business committee were able to give muchneeded assistance to small business through this legislation we hear so much about big business in this day and age that we often forget the importance of small business to our society our nations 18 million small businesses are a leading source of jobs innovation investment and savings in our economy they account for 60 percent of existing employment 80 percent of new jobs and half of all industrial innovation numbers like these cannot be ignored and the administrations bill does not neglect them the bipartisan package increases equipment writeoffs for small business to 10 000 by 1986 it increases tax credits for the purchase of used equipment it raises the limits of taxexempt accumulated earnings from 150 000 to 200 000 per year finally it increases the allowable number of stockholders for small corporations from 15 to 25 also i am extremely pleased that the hanceconable tax plan includes a 15percent tax credit for woodburning stoves which is not included in the ways and means bill since woodburning stoves are widely used in the state of maine it will provide the financial incentive necessary for individuals to install woodburning stoves the tax credit will also serve a demonstration of support by the federal government for the effectiveness of woodburning stoves as an energy alternative in reducing the nations consumption of oil the maine people should be commended for their efforts in significantly conserving their usage of home heating oil finally it is truly unfortunate that we were forced to include a wide variety of extraneous provisionssocalled sweetenersto satisfy the special interests of this country it is too bad that we could not be voting today on a clean tax billone that was aimed solely at giving the american people a long overdue tax break but that is the nature of the legislative process and the administrations proposal is certainly the best one before us today i must also confess that certain provisions in both tax bills before us today tempted me to vote against all tax bills i am speakinig of the provisions included in both bills to provide tax reductions for the oil industry some of us supported a rules change to lift the oil industry cuta out of todays bill and to show them the light of day but our efforts were rejected it is unfortunate that in order to give our people a muchdeserved tax break we also had to capitulate to special interests and simultaneously give the oil companies a tax break we ignored the fact that oil companies already receive extensive special tax provisions in our laws we ignored the reality that oil companies would receive the general business tax breaks included in these bills we ignored the recent astronomical price hikes and profits of oil companies and instead we camouflaged more breaks for big oil into a forest of tax legislation nevertheless i will vote with the administration today while i do not agree with certain provisions of this legislation i do not think it is fair to deny the american people meaningful tax relief any longer our economic problems are well known the solution to these woes is less certain but the administrations plan i believe offers a more realistic change to get our economy moving again we have acted in this chamber in recent weeks to set a new economic course and today we should keep that course"], [0.02776496484875679,

area must be given the most serious consideration before any project can be authorized in fact during committee consideration of this bill i supported an amendment to specifically require a detailed study of those effects even though i was confident that the environmental impact statement associated with the feasibility study would do so in the absence of such an amendment one particular aspect of the bill the costsharing arrangement by which the local sponsoring agencies have agreed to accept a substantial portion of the cost is a significant step for the congress to take in authorizing feasibility studies for water projects the willingness of the potential beneficiaries to bear that cost is indicative of the strong support in the local area and will serve as an example for future project sponsors that they will henceforth be expected to contribute to meeting the cost of these projects and the associated studies the adoption of this bill by the house as well as the previous

esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and

certain that most if not all members of the body remain concerned over another area of government activitythe area of government regulation i believe we are all committed to regulatory reform in those areas where reform is obviously appropriate such reform is obviously appropriate when the removal of burdensome regulation would promote competition without adversely affecting the american consumer for these reasons i take this opportunity to announce my intention to introduce in the not too distant future a bill aimed at achieving regulatory reform in the area of petroleum and petroleum product pipeline rates i hasten to add at this point that i am talking only about petroleum pipelinespipelines which are not franchised by the government and which are not in any sense of the term a legally protected monopoly in my view the government has the right if not the obligation to regulate rates of an industry when the government extends to that industry a franchise a license or any mechanism to protect it from competition with regard to petroleum pipelines however the government affords no protection from competition competition in the industry is extensive shippers have multiple options to serve their transportation needs and the consumers are the beneficiaries of the competition provided by the private sector nonetheless congress has largely through oversight in my opinion continued the rate regulation of these pipelines when we created the federal energy regulatory commission in public law 9591 we transferred to the department of energy and the ferc the authority to regulate pipelines including petroleum pipelines unfortunately the broad transfer authority included the auaiority to set and prescribe rates or petroleum pipelines back in 1906 whren rate regulation of these pipeline was first established there was sforme justification for it because shipprs had relatively few options availablf to them for transport of their petroleum commodities today however shippers enjoy a great variety of options which include intramodal intermodal and shipper exchanges the recent history of the industry reveals that these options have created competitive pressures resulting in the establishment of fair and equitable prices for shippers and for the ultimate consumers despite this healthy competition and the shipper consumer protection it provides the ferc remains saddled with the responsibility to set rates for this industry almost from its creation the ferc has been struggling with the question of how to set these rates it has yet to come up with a satisfactory answersimply because there is no satisfactory method for setting rates for a competitive industry where there is no need for regulation there is no satisfactory way to regulate i am not calling for the complete de regulation of petroleum pipelines they are common carriers and their obligations as such should continue to be regulated by the ferc the ferc should continue to enforce the legal prescriptions against possible discriminatory or preferential behavior it is only the rate regulation that is unnecessary and it is only that function that i want to extinguish for reasons that i am certain will be brought out at hearings rate regulation discourages competition it imposes an unnecessary burden upon the petroleum pipeline industry especially the independents i have discussed this

clear evidence that the house can move quickly on legislation when the situation warrants since the introduction of the chairmans original capital infusion bill in february the banking committee has moved steadily ahead examining the alternatives and devising a program designed to help the nations mortgage lenders survive current economic conditions few would doubt that such assistance is needed indeed a newsweek cover story last month so developed the publics awareness of the problems of the thrifts that congress was forced to reaffirm the safety and stability of the nations banking system these are times of great change within all sectors of our financial system and mortgage lenders would be challenged under the best of conditions prolonged high interest rates have helped to make the transition almost unbearably painful as institutions saddled with huge portfolios of low interest h 2453 mortgages struggle to compete for record cost deposits our committee heard testimony from the chairman of the federal home loan bank board which further quantified the extent of thrift probleins a negative 0 75 percent return on industry assets for 1981 losses of almost 5 billion over the year and net worth eroded by some 15 percent over the course of the yearthese statistics threaten the survival of many institutions survival is directly tied to interest rates rates which many expected to drop before now but which have shown enormous resistance to real improvements slight drops this spring were insignificant when corrected for inflation which virtually disappeared during the same period by the federal home loan bank boards own estimate some 400 institutions would exhaust their capital accounts this year if interest rates remain at current levels even with a drop of 200 basis points nearly half that number would not survive these are the grim statistics that motivate our action today for most institutions erosion of net worth have proved to be the most serious i fireat to survival cash flow is often adequate to keep them in business but when net worth falls below the guidelines established by banking regulators institutions are subject to intervention and often merger during 1981 the pace of mergers was furious unprecedented in industry history the publics confidence in the survival of the industry was eroded right along with net worth and that coupled with aggressive competition from nonbanking institutions like money market funds precipitated a dangerous decline in the share of net savings deposits flowing into thrifts twentythree of the 1981 thrift mergers arranged by the fslic required some form of financial assistance from the deposit insurance fund additional mergers of savings banks drew on the more substantial assets of the fdic the high costs of some mergers coupled with the growing potential for more largescale assisted mergers helped the regulators to recognize the limitations of the merger solution although the risk to the insurance fund depends on future interest rates and thus is impossible to predict accurately it became clear that some form of assistance would be necessary for the survival of both the industry and the insurance system during committee consideration of this legislation i ade 4 that we hold any proposal to certain minimum criteria in order that we accomplish our goal as efficiently as possible i believe that most other members of the committee shared my concern that the program we des gn be of longterm benefit to both the industry and to the nations consumers certainly i am convinced of the public benefits of the survival of the nations savings and loans but it is equally important to secure that survival as efficiently as possible first we need to protect against subsidizing those institutions which have no chance of survival there is no direct cost to the guarantees until an institution should fail whereupon the full value of the guarantees must be paid it makes sense to minimize the risk of such failures by permitting the regulators to withhold assistance from doomed institutions i am pleased that h r 6267 provides the necessary authority second we should deny federal assistance to those institutions whose troubles are the result of poor management and bad investment decisions it is not our intent to shelter the unwise from the consequences of their own mistakes we aim only to sustain those who are threatened by murderous interest rates the bill we have before us mandates that the regulators shall ascertain that the losses of any participating institution are not due to mismanagement they will also disqualify those who may attempt to manipulate net worth in order to qualify for the program these are important safeguards which i endorse from the beginning there was also a strong consensus among committee members that assistance should be limited to institutions with significant mortgage portfolios and that assistance should be tied to continuing that mortgage lending commitment in the first draft the bill specified a low rate of interest for new mortgage commitments as attractive as such rates would be to consumers i opposed requiring such lowinterest rates on the grounds that they would only perpetuate the current mismatch between assets and liabilities of thrifts i am pleased that the current version of the bill contains the mortgage lending requirement without specifying an interest rate one amendment accepted by the committee during markup was of special interest to those of us to represent states with franchise taxes such taxes are not based on profits and thus failing institutions are equally liable yet the committee was reluctant to permit federal assistance payments to flow through the institutions into state coffers the original version of the bill simply exempted institutions from such state taxes although i am opposed on principal to franchise taxes i am equally opposed to federal overrides of state taxing prerogatives and thus i was pleased to support a compromise amendment which simply provides for a delay in payment of state franchise taxes during participation in this program it is important to remember that the net worth guarantee program will not solve the basic problems which brought savings and loans so much trouble they will remain saddled with lowyield mortgages for many years and despite the fact that their investments in such mortgages were mandated by federal regulation this program does not address this problem i have introduced a mortgage warehousing program which would relieve mortgage lenders of the worst of this burden but my bill seems to have fallen victim to the budget ax the more fundamental problem which unless solved will remain a wolf at the door of these institutions is the level of interest rates we are really buying a temporary reprieve in hopes that future interest rates will provide a permanent solution to these problems it is clear that mortgage lenders will have an important role to play in the future if those interest rates return to tolerable levels but it is more difficult to predict when that might be

eign sovereigns i am doubly gratified on april 27 1982 the house language by what i anticipate will be the action is acceptable to the administration of the house todaydoubly gratified whereas the senate language is not because this is the second time we therefore it is my hope that the have enacted this legislation in this house will once again pass the text session contained in the pending motion so when i introduced the original bill that the other body might concur and on this issue i intended to remedy then forward the legislation to the what i saw as a fundamental unfairpresident for his approval ness in our antitrust laws arising in i do not intend to recapitulate the the wake of the supreme courts 1878 debate of last april but briefly the decision in pfizer inc v the governbill makes two changes in antitrust ment of india 434 unitedstates 308 1978 the trebledamage suits first it limits majority in that case held that a forplaintiff foreign governments to single eign sovereign was a person who could damages rather than treble damages recover treble damages under section 4 just as the united states is itself limit of the clayton act yet the court held h 9560 co in a 1941 case united states v cooper corporation 312 unitedstates 600 1941 that the unitedstates government was not a person within the meaning of our antitrust laws and was not therefore entitled to monetary damages it became necessary for congress to enact section 4a of the clayton act to correct this interpretation of congressional intent but in so doing congress limited the united states to recovery of actual damages by it sustained and the cost of suit 15 unitedstatesc 15 a in my original bill i r 2812 which i introduced on march 25 1981 i sought equality between foreign governments and our own and that objective has been preserved and fully realized in the measture before us today my second original object ive was recip rocity a requirement that the conduct for which redress was ought in our courts be illegal in a foreitgn sovereigns own country that sutchi laws be enforced and that our own government could recover actual damages under such law if injured by similar conduct when i put it into my bill reciprocity seemed an excellent concept but after receiving testimony from the department of justice the department of state and a representative of the american bar association our monopolies and commercial law subcommittee membl rs myself among them became convinced that it would be unworkable in actual practice the assistant attorney general for antitrust mr william baxter advised us thatthe administration of the reciprocity features of h r 2812 will be quite complex and may itself serve on occasion to exacerbate problems with our foreign trading partners the legal adviser to the department of state mr davis r robinson told us thatthis threetiered reciprocity test in our view would be difficult if not impossible for other countries to meet given variations in concept and approach involved in even the most effective foreign competition laws we further are concerned that lengthy and expensive litigation might be required to establish whether particular foreign systems of competition regulation satisfy the reciprocity test with possible embarrassment to our foreign relations as well although suggesting that the threetiered test might be clarified the representative of the state department later acknowledged that he was not sure how that might be accomplished so as to avoid the problems he considered inherent in such tests as set forth in h r 2812 on balance i believe we did the correct thing in eliminating the reciprocity test this bill is a fair one and an appropriate amendment to our antitrust laws i urge my colleagues to support the motion to suspend the rules and pass s 816 as amended"], [0.0024123787879943848, 0.5024123787879944, 0, "federally assisted credit activitiesthe increase in the public debt limit to which

percent of all fuinds raised in outstanding public debt at the end of credit markets in addition when fedfiscal year 1970 was 372 6 billion but erally assisted borrowing is added to at the end of fisral year 1980 it had es the 14 6 percent figure for 197880 calated to 908 7 billion if current the combined impact reaches 26 6 pertrends continue we will witness a na cent of all funds raised in credit martional debt of over 1 trillion in fiscal kets year 1982 this reduction in the supply of we are faced with this looming debt credit market funds all other things increase because of the fiscal irrespon equal has an upward pressure on insibility of the previous administration terest rates unemployment goes up because of the downward impact of higher interest rates on interestsensitive industries such as housing automobiles and consumer durable goods generally the higher unemployment results in greater federal spending less revenue a larger deficit more borrowing to finance the deficit and the cycle begins all over again furthermore federal borrowing and its impact on credit markets af fects inflation higher interest rates are passe through to consumers as a cost of dcdir business the consumer price index is very sensilv to changes in market interest rates when interest rates rise so does the cpi in turn outlays for the many government programs indexed to the cpi increase more than expected again the deficit increases we must borrow more money to finan ce the deficit and the economic treadmill continues all reinforced by the impact of federal borrowing and excessive spending onl expectations of investors managers and consumers in addition fewer funds available in credit markets due to federal borrowing leaves less financial capital availatble to the private sector for the purchase of the physical capital needed to improve plant and equipment failure to so modernize reduces our already negative net increases in productivity lower productivity adversely affects both inflation in the long term and our ability to compete effectively in world markets if we are to escape the economic trap of the vicious cycles i have outlined we must understand thle budget forces behind this impending increase in the public debt limit we cannot afford to relearn the lesson of this experience the hard waynamely that a nations government cannot continue to spend more money than it takes in year in and year out and finance the difference we can escape the trap by making sizable rescissions in the fiscal year 1981 budget and reduce the fiscal year 1982 budget well below the outlay estimates left behind as the appropriate legacy of the economic mismanagement of the carter administration my own budget study for example reveals where 56 billion could be taken out of the fiscal year 1981 budget i am confident that many of my colleagues have their own worthwhile suggestions for budget cuts as well unfortunately the increase in the debt presently before us is for the payment of obligations already incurred by the time we reach this point in the process the dirty work has already been done the time to truly prevent debt limit increases is not to authorize and appropriate the spending in the first place i hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are sudden converts to the cause of opposing debt limit increases will keep this in mind as the 97th congress tackles the fiscal year 1981 and 1982 budgets in coming weeks fcbruaiy 5 1981 based on the foregoing the only responsible vote on this issue is to oppose this proposed increase in the national debt only in so doing will we have the incentive to make the necessary reductions in spending in order to start this nation on the road to an economic recovery"],

basic principle of freedom of travel and which discriminate against a group of human beings in an ugly act of official prejudice this law denies the right of entry to this country to lesbians and gay

unusual situation for the energy and water development subcommittee i say unusual because usually we have one of the first appropriations bills through the congress this year we had our regular appropriation bill ready before the recess the bill has been approved by the house appropriations committee it is ready for consideration by this house but this bill is a continuing resolution providing interim funding for a few weeks until our regular bills can get out certainly it is wrong to try to deal with such an important issue as the clinch river project with limited debate and no opportunity for substitute amendments or other measures to perfect the will of this body let me also point out that our energy and water development subcommittee has followed this project closely we have heard all the testimony reviewed all the facts from everyone knowledgeable about this projectboth nationally and internationally we believe strongly you should support it you should know that clinch river is a national project it involves jobs from california to massachusetts it involves the skills of many highly trained technical personnel as well as skilled craftsmen over 3 500 jobs are at stake on this vote the project has the support of the president the great majority of our leading scientists and engineers and most energy experts who look to our future it is supported by the leading labor and business organizations maybe you saw the statement in todays washington post more than that the project is a necessary project if we are to provide the energy this country will need after the turn of the century let me give you a few facts first a breeder reactor system can use the energy available from our uranium resources 60 times more efficiently than todays light water reactors certainly this ought to interest those of you devoted in energy conservation second the energy available from the uranium already mined and stored above ground as tails from our enriching plants for todays light water reactors is roughly equal to all our unmined coal and 3 times the energy in opec oil reserves third even at a very modest growth rate the nation will need to have twice the amount of electricity supply that we now have by the first decade in the 21st century the long time required for developing this technology and the tremendous investment in people and facilities would make it costly to the nation and foolish to interrupt this development now we would lose the benefit of over 1 3 billion invested to date in this project let me address five issues first crbr is foremost a research and demonstration effort it represents the stateoftheart of liquid metal fast breeder reactor technology in the world over 1 000 engineering changes have been made since the conceptual design was completed incorporating the latest technological developments and improvements in safety systems mechanical components core design and fuels second crbr is the most economical means of developing breeder technology by the turn of the century the site is now being cleared the design is 90 percent complete over 1 3 billion has been invested and 70 percent of the plant equipment is ready or on order third the crbr effort has assembled an impressive team of people and facilities which are at the forefront of american breeder reactor development 753 private utilities are partners in crbr development fourth the current total cost estimate from the department of energy for crbr is 3 6 billion including the 1 3 billion already invested this includes all engineering design procurement and construction costs and accounts for current inflation estimates finally the crbr may provide revenues far beyond its cost after it is operating as an nrc licensed powerplant and
