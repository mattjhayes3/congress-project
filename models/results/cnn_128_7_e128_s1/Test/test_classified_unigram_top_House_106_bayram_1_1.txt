that are extremely important to the education of our children and because it hurts displaced workers i urge my colleagues to oppose it the first problem with this gop bill is that it severely shortchanges education by 3 5 billion this bill would end our commitment to hire 100 000 new teachers and to reduce class sizes i am concerned by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited english proficiency these funds support the training and retraining of bilingual teachers the disparities in minority education will be increased if this bill is passed secondly this bill severely shortchanges programs that assist displaced workers this is a major issue for my constituents in el paso as i know that it is for many of you in your home districts in el paso and in other areas along the unitedstates mexico border nafta has created many displaced workers and this bill does an injustice to programs that could help them for example the bill cuts assistance to over 215 000 dislocated workers and it cuts the dislocated worker program by 207 million below the 2000 level these cuts will make it more difficult for these workers to find jobs this bill also cuts adult job training for almost 40 000 adults the cuts in adult training programs equal 93 million or 10 percent below the request and 2000 levels finally this bill provides only 9 6 million for employment assistance to another class of displaced workers our homeless veterans there are over a quarter million homeless veterans in this country and the provisions in this bill will deny employment assistance to thousands of these americans who have faithfully served their country this is unacceptable the root of these problems is that in order to pay for the proposed republican trilliondollar tax breaks for the wealthiest americans we are attacking programs that are needed to educate our children and to assist displaced workers again i stand in

deadline i point out one was recently when the gentleman from wisconsin was chairman it is true that we did not make this deadline this year however it is also true that keeping our fiscal house in order does take a little longer than the freewheeling bigspending days of the past because we must ensure that all funding is spent efficiently and where it is needed the most the conference report before us this afternoon not only holds the line on the presidents additional spending requests but also responsibly funds areas important to every american citizen and protects the american people from waste fraud and abuse across the entire federal government earlier this year the republican congress made a commitment to end the 30year raid on social security and according to the congressional budget office we have now completed that task the president began the budget negotiations by taking a large step toward our position on the social security issue and joined us in locking away every penny of social security we worked with him in a bipartisan fashion to protect retirement security we were determined to protect american seniors and this congress and its leadership denied any piece of legislation on the house floor that spent one penny of it to achieve our goal of protecting american seniors and responsibly funding important programs we are including in this bill a plan to direct every federal agency to reduce spending by less than onehalf of one percent 38 percent of 1 percent by routing out waste fraud and abuse surely the government can save less than about half a penny out of every dollar this republican congress is simply asking those who run federal agencies to make fiscally responsible budgeting decisions with the money taxed out of our paychecks we all know the agency directors and executives know where the waste is and i am relatively certain they will be able to weed out at least that much in savings with this sensible plan in addition to meeting the fiscally responsible objectives this conference report also ensures that our principles of quality and flexibility in the funding for teachers have been met in the laborhhs section of the bill this congress ensures that funding may no longer be used to hire unqualified teachers provides that schools will have more flexibility in using their funding for improving the qualityof uncertified teachers and increases the amount of funding that may used for professional training for teachers the administration pushed for a onesizefitsall mandate in which washington controlled the 100 000 new teachers program not every district needs new teachers some need bettertrained teachers other districts need books hightech equipment and updated math and reading programs i think it is foolish for the washington bureaucracy to tell every school district in america that washington knows best how to spend tax dollars to educate our children the debate in washington is not only about money it is also about how that money should be spent this bill moves us closer to the right balance of education funding by providing additional funds for americas students through programs like pell grants and special education while lowering the bureaucratic burden imposed by washington through programs like goals 2000 the commerce justice state section of the conference report maintains our commitment to enhancing local law enforcement without involving washington bureaucrats we also provide funding for 1 000 new border patrol agents funds for increased criminal and illegal alien detention and the resources necessary to end the severe naturalization backlog at the ins the district of columbia continues to receive the high level of funding provided in each round of this process the conference report paves the way for dramatic improvement in the education of washingtons children the safety of our streets and the management of our nations capital h r 3194 also brokers a responsible compromise on the environment in the interior appropriations section of this conference report republicans rejected attempts to impose the restrictions of the kyoto global warming regime on americans without senate consideration of the treaty nevertheless the bill maintains our high environmental standards and ensures our air and water will be cleaned into the next millennium while i will permit the chairman of the committee on appropriations to describe fully all the contents of the appropriations bill i did want to note the inclusion of the satellite copyright legislation about which many of our constituents have expressed concerns during the past year i am pleased that this bill will provide a new copyright license to satellite television that will allow constituents to receive their local television channels over their satellite service in addition this bill will bring real competition ensure better prices and choices for our constituents protect existing subscribers from having their distant network service shut off and make it easier for consumers to get either a waiver or an eligibility test for distant network service in the event the waiver request is denied this bill is

also provide numerous exemptions for certain categories of workers and allow states to opt out of the minimum wage increase i find such an attack on americas working families to be indefensible that is bad enough but the republican house leadership will also attempt to either kill or take advantage of a minimum wage bill by linking it to a tax package provides that 122 billion in tax breaks to

gentleman from massachusetts for the opportunity to address this house i rise in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us go

of chicago the south suburbs and cook and will counties a lot of industrial as well as farm communities and even though this district that i represent is so very very diverse i find there is a common message and that is the folks back home want us to come here republicans and democrats and work together to find solutions to the challenges that we face that is why i am so proud that over the last 5 years we have done so many things we were told we could not do we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years we gave a middleclass tax cut for the first time in 16 years we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation and a great accomplishment just this past year was we stopped the raid on social security for the first time in 30 years that is progress on our agenda and we are continuing to move forward to find better ways to help find solutions our agenda is pretty simple paying down the public national debt saving social security and medicare helping our local schools and we also want to bring fairness to the tax code that is one of the issues i want to talk about today because i believe that as we work to bring fairness to the tax code particularly to middleclass working families that we should focus first on the most unfair consequence of our current complicated tax code and that is the marriage tax penalty which is suffered by almost 21 million married working couples let me explain what the marriage tax penalty is under our current tax code if they are married both husband and wife are working they pay more in taxes than they do if they stay single let me give this example a marriage tax penalty example a machinist and a schoolteacher middleclass working folks in joliet illinois with a combined income of 63 000 paymore and here is how they do it if they have a machinist making 31 500 he is in the 15 percent tax bracket if he marries a schoolteacher with an identical income of 31 500 under our tax code they file jointly their combined income of 63 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and for this machinist and schoolteacher they pay the average marriage tax penalty of almost 1 400 more just because they are married under our tax code now if they chose to live together instead of getting married they would have saved that 1 400 our tax code punishes them if they choose to get married that is just wrong it is a pretty fair question is it right is it fair that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher in joliet illinois pay more in higher taxes let me give my colleagues another example here of two schoolteachers also of joliet illinois michelle and shad hallihan they were just married in the last couple of years a wonderful young couple i have had a chance to sit down and talk with them and of course i have a nice wedding photo the point is that shad has taught a little longer than michelle and he makes 38 000 a year his wife michelle makes 23 500 because they chose to get married to live together in holy matrimony they suffer the marriage tax penalty because their combined income when they file jointly pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket for them for michelle and shad hallihan in joliet illinois two schoolteachers they pay almost a thousand dollars more michelle has pointed out to me since they have just had a baby that is almost 3 000 diapers that 1 000 of marriage tax penalty would pay for in that family if they were allowed to keep it now the republicans in this congress believe that eliminating the marriage tax penalty should be a priority and we believe that in this era of budget surpluses when the federal government is taking in more than we have been spending that we should give some of it back we want to focus that on bringing fairness to the tax code this past year we sent to the president legislation that would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for people like michelle and shad hallihan unfortunately the president and vice president gore chose to veto that legislation because they wanted to spend the money on new government programs my colleagues should it not be a priority to help people like michelle and shad hallihan

marriage tax elimination act h r 6 cosponsored by myself and the gentleman from missouri and the gentleman from indiana as well as 230 members of the house that is why it is so important we want to bring fairness to the tax code that is why i am so pleased that the leadership of this house led by the gentleman from illinois the speaker of the house has made a decision to move a standalone piece of legislation a standalone bill which wipes out the marriage tax penalty for the vast majority of those who suffer in the next few weeks the speaker intends to bring that legislation to the floor

this school students receive a topnotch education unfortunately the students also feel th disturbing effects of overcrowding this is a school built for 200 students but now it has an enrollment of over 600 the added portable classrooms take up precious playground space which should be used so that students can take part in physical education and activities i have visited other schools in my district which suffer from similar circumstances in santa maria the oakley schools enrollment is currently over 800 while the school was originally built for 480 students the first of four lunch sessions begins at 10 30 the last children do not finish until well after 1 30 in the afternoon in san luis obispo county cambria grammar school was built to handle 200 students with eight portable buildings they now have 345 students have very limited playground space here and their kindergarten needed to move to a nearby middle school because of overcrowding this kindergarten is now housed in a portable room with a small fencedin playground i spent over 20 years as a school nurse in the santa barbara school system i have seen firsthand the damage that deteriorating school buildings can do students cannot thrive academically if they are learning in overcrowded and crumbling buildings at the most crucial time for learning in their lives we simply must do better for our students i strongly support the americas better classroom act this legislation enjoys bipartisan support and has 225 cosponsors it would provide approximately 25 billion in interestfree funds to state and local

public health and safety this does not mean uniform monitoring programs this does not mean that epa may impose a federal template on states like the housepassed bill the senate amendment to h r 999 also does not address control of pollution from point or nonpoint sources it imposes no new mandates unfunded or otherwise like the housepassed bill the senate amendment clarifies that state water quality criteria for pathogens or pathogen indicators for coastal recreation waters must be as protective of human health as epas criteria this does not mean that states must adopt criteria that are identical to those that have been published by epa states adopt water quality criteria under section 303 c of the clean water act and continue to have the flexibility provided under that section to change epas criteria based on sitespecific conditions or to adopt different scientificallyjustified criteria thus if a state can demonstrate that the pathogen indicators that itls using are as protective of human health as the criteria for pathogen indicators that epa has published a state may continue to use its existing criteria the housepassed bill provided that the information database authorized under section 406 e is intended to be information on exceedances of water quality standards in coastal recreation waters only this database does not address other matters the senate amendment further specifies that the source of that information is to be from state and local monitoring programs only like the house bill the senate amendment provides for epa implementation of a monitoring and notification program only in situations where a state is not implementing a program that protects public health and safety the bill does not provide for partial epa implementation and partial state implementation of a monitoring and notification program in addition epas duty to conduct a monitoring and notification program is subject to the same conditions as a state program this means that epa has the same flexibility that states are provided to target available resources to those waters that it determines are the highest priorities finally like the housepassed bill the senate amendment provides that the term coastal recreation waters includes only the great lakes and waters that are adjacent to the coastline of the united states coastal recreation waters is not synonymous with the coastal zone as defined under the coastal zone management act the senate amendment further clarifies in bill language that geographic scope of this act does not include any inland waters and does not extend beyond the mouth of any river or stream or other body of water having unimpaired natural connection with open sea i urge all members to support h r 999 as amended"]],

yielding me the time let me talk about the impact of the alternative minimum tax on this bill because as the gentleman from texas knows i have been speaking out about this for the past few years and it is time to eliminate the alternative minimum tax it no longer performs the function it was intended to and in my view has perverse consequences in the tax system now laying that aside let me tell my colleagues that i had a call this week from a republican interest group asking me to support this bill the rationale was the statistic that they were offering that suggested that 61 386 married couples in my district were affected by the marriage penalty when i asked how many would not get any benefit from the republican bill because of the alternative minimum tax they did not know and they did not know because they did not care they saw this then and they see this today as a purely political issue now is the amt a minor flaw in this bill absolutely not it would cost 65 billion to fix the problem to put it another way the republican bill promised about 250 billion of tax relief and by sleight of hand uses the amt to take back 65 billion or 26 percent of the benefit this is not a small problem it is a known problem it is a fixable problem but in this legislation that they are offering it is not fixed now we hear that this will be taken care of in the future sounds a little bit like the popeye character whimpy promising to buy someone a hamburger next week if only on this day we will buy him one if there is a problem then fix the way we do in the democratic proposal if their side keeps promising a pig in a poke eventually the public is going to demand a look in the bag now i had a few other callers in support of fixing this tax penalty and i h302 co agreed with them and that is why i am going to vote for the democratic alternative when i asked some of them why they were flirting with the republican penalty bill where half the money does not even go to fixing the marriage penalty but to making a single penalty in current law worse it is written so that the more children they have the less likely they are to get any marriage penalty relief they do not know what is in the fine print so if they are so concerned about children why did they not take the money they were using to increase marriage bonuses and use it to solve the amt problem with families with children they have the money it is right in their own bill vo for tens of thousands of american families the only thing the republican bill gives them is a requirement that they are going to have to fill out two tax forms instead of one the regular tax form and a 50line alternative minimum tax form now that truly is a penalty on the republican side for being married and having children these

exactly how this amendment was treated in a bipartisan fashion by the committee on the judiciary in the markup of this bill when this particular amendment or one very like it was defeated by a bipartisan 16 to 6 vote there are good reasons why it was rejected there and there are good reasons why it should be rejected here this industryspecific exemption from federal jurisdiction makes no sense it is like a bill of attainder it irrationally singles out one industry and slams the federal courthouse door in its face all of us strive to be sure that justice is blind but when one identifies one group of people and says they are not entitled to the same treatment under the law that everyone else is justice is not blind the amendment is wholly inconsistent with what the framers had in mind in establishing diversity jurisdiction in article iii of our constitution they wanted to allow interstate businesses to have claims against them heard in federal court so as to avoid local biases nowhere in this concept is the idea that certain industries should be exempted from this right that certain kinds of businesses are less entitled to federal court protection one may not like gun manufacturers but think of the things that one does like and consider whether if a similar amendment were offered to single out something that is important to one and say that those who promote and support that particular idea that particular industry whatever the case might be that they are not entitled to sit in the same forum of justice that everyone else in this country is entitled to the amendment clearly is designed to single out the firearms industry because in some quarters it is unpopular but that is exactly what the framers of the constitution were trying to avoid they are trying to ensure a fair evenhanded federal court forum for defendants that may otherwise be hailed into a local court less concerned about protecting the rights of an outofstate company it is very interesting that in the committee report the additional dissenting views submitted by the gentleman from new york and others on the gun issue makes a big point of the fact that the naacp has filed a class action against the gun industry seeking to recover for money that the public sector must pay for the consequences of gun violence the report goes on to say that we should not handicap such important civil suits before they have even begun what i find very interesting about that point is that the naacp filed their lawsuit in federal court not state court that choice presumably was made because the lawyers filing the naacp suit know that the federal courts are more appropriate for dealing with these interstate issues presented by these cases this bill would make it easier for groups like the naacp to bring such cases in federal court because it works both ways it expands the rights of plaintiffs to bring interstate cases in federal court as well as expanding the ability of

thank the gentleman for yielding me this time i voted against the treasurypostal bill when it originally was presented to the house i did so because i thought it was inadequate it came back from conference andi opposed it at that point in time we did not really have a real conference but to the extent that a conference report came back i said it was inadequate and i opposed it the gentleman from arizona rises and i think correctly states the provisions of this bill i think he also correctly states that we did in fact reach bipartisan agreement on this bill and that in fact the bill as it now stands as it stood before the president as it stands now is a good bill it is a bill in my opinion that every member of this house on either side of the aisle can support it is furthermore a bill that i hope every member of the body will support at some point in time in the very near future i am not sure when we are going to get to that point but hopefully in the near future the gentleman from arizona also correctly points out and the gentleman from florida pointed out if one reads the veto message that the president of the united states says that he can sign this bill in fact i urged the president of the united states to sign this bill i wished he had signed the bill but he chose to make the point which frankly we have been making over and over again that unfortunately this process did not come to really focus until just a few weeks ago the reason it did not come to focus until a few weeks ago and i do not speak just to the treasurypostal bill it is because for 8 2 months and effectively all of september we pretended that the appropriations process was not going to be a process in which all of us would be party but it would be a process that simply frankly the majority party would be a party of unfortunately when we did as the gentleman from arizona has pointed out come to agreement and agree on a very good bill we got it down there relatively late i e 10 days ago i would urge the members however not to become too exercised about this bill the reason i do that is because i believe we do have agreement what we do not have agreement on is what the president discussed in his veto message and they are important issues they are unrelated at least substantively to the treasurypostal bill but we know and any of us who have been in the last weeks of any legislative session and i found this when i was in the state senate for 12 years and i found it here for 19 years that unfortunately issues tend to get wrapped up with one another that do not necessarily relate to one another substantively but clearly do politically so i would urge the majority party i would urge ourselves to try to come to agreement now both sides feel that agreements are not being kept that is not a good context in which to try to get back to the table the majority party believes the president said he would sign this bill i was not in the room therefore cannot assert that that was or was not the case some others who apparently were in the room and talked to the administration said that the administration said that they could sign this bill but again i was not in the room but that they were concerned they were particularly concerned about a particular tax provision and they wanted to see all the tax provisions considered at one time now i hope clearly that this bill is going to go to committee and the veto will be considered my suspicion is that we will at some point in time hopefully in the near term fold it in but i would urge all my colleagues that when the president says that it is related to other things his desire and i hope our desire is to get the issues before the house resolved get the issues before the senate resolved and send themto the president we have just had a significant discussion about the fact that we do not have agreement on the laborhealth ^bill the gentleman from wisconsin who was in the room i was not but the gentleman from wisconsin whose integrity i trust wholly says that he thought they had an agreement it is my understanding although the gentleman from florida did not say so in so many words that he thought there was an agreement but he needed to check it out with some people that agreement fell i would hope that in the next 24 hours and i see the gentleman from texas the majority whip is on the floor he and i worked together on a number of things but i would hope that we could come to grips with the items that the president of the united states has said he believes are priority items whether one agrees with the veto of the treasurypostal bill or not everybody agrees that it was not on the substance of the bill the bill is a good bill it is however an effort by the president of the united states to bring to closure the 106th congress to bring to closure the 106th congress in a way that will bring credit to agreements between the parties i referred earlier in discussions about the appropriations bills to an extraordinary speech given by newt gingrich on the floor of this house it was a speech which i have entitled the perfectionist caucus speech it was a speech in which he said the american public has elected the president of one party a majority party in the house and senate of another party and a very large and significant number of members of the presidents party it is not surprising therefore that we find ourselves in substantial disagreement from time to time on substantive important issues but as newt gingrich said in that perfectionist caucus speech it is the expectation of the american public that we will come to agreement that we will come to compromise democracy is not perfect and rarely do we win everything that we want but the american public does expect us to agree they expect to bring this congress to a close we argue on our side that they expect us to do some things that we have been talking about for an entire year and indeed longer than that in many instances to which the president referred like education funding for classrooms and more teachers that is really not a contentious issue most of us on this floor on both sides of the aisle know that we have a shortage of teachers know that we have a shortage of classrooms know that we would like to get classroom sizes down we ought to move on that most of us say that we are for prescription drugs for seniors we have differences on how that ought to occur what the president is saying is we ought to come to agreement on that because frankly seniors that are having trouble paying for prescription drugs do not care whether we agree on this dotting of the s or the crossing of the ts they want us to come to agreement it is a shame we cannot do that i see the gentleman from

years matt championed issues like hunger in africa that brought him no particular glory and no attention he was a passionate advocate for those who could not adequately defend themselves and a voice for meeting our international responsibilities in a humane way in his present position at the world bank and his many volunteer efforts he remains a strong dedicated leader in securing human rights for all matts road to congress began like many members with a career in law he first moved to ithaca new york in 1968 to join a law firm in that city just 1 year later he was elected as tompkins countys district attorney making him the first democrat to hold a countywide elected office there in decades in 1974 he was enlisted to run for the house seat which was then being vacated by former representative howard robison a very distinguished republican who held that seat for a good many years and who was retiring at that moment matt mchugh won that seat and served the district admirably and well for 18 years when he retired from the house he was widely praised by members of both parties as well as in the press for his thoughtfulness his fairness and his integrity a national columnist upon the news of his retirement wrote that matt mchugh was an example of the best the house can offer our ranking member the gentleman from wisconsin said and i quote in my view there is no member of this house who more aptly sums up what public service ought to be all about than does matt mchugh throughout his years in congress he made ithaca his home ithacans continue to take pride in having sent a man of such distinction to the house of representatives and community leaders there have told me that they welcome such a permanent commemoration of matt and his years of public service although he was never the kind of man to seek such honors i know that he deserves recognition and this permanent commemoration of the service he gave will remind people of the fine example he set

valid for up to 1 year and can also be extended in increments of not more than 6 months the visa waiver program allows aliens traveling from certain countries to come to the united states as temporary visitors for business or pleasure without having to obtain b visas however a visit cannot exceed 90 days and no extensions are available the attorney general can authorize an alien admitted under the visa waiver program who faces an emergency situation to remain in the united states for 120 days beyond the initial 90day admission under voluntary departure while the 210day period provided by the initial 90day admission and the 120 days under voluntary departure is adequate to deal with most emergency situations it does not meet the need of a relatively few aliens who are admitted to the united states under the visa waiver program and are receiving longterm medical treatment h r 2961 would address this problem by establishing a 3year pilot program authorizing the attorney general to waive the 120day cap on voluntary departure for a limited number of patients and attending family members who enter the unitedstates under the visa waiver program the legislation contains safeguards to ensure only those truly in need of longterm medical care can obtain such a waiver an alien seeking a waiver would be required to provide a comprehensive statement from their physician detailing the treatment sought and the aliens anticipated length of stay in the united states in addition the alien and attending family members would be required to provide proof of their ability to pay for the treatment and their living expenses the bill caps the total number of waivers at 300 annually and limits the number of family members who can enjoy the benefits of a waiver the bill also requires the ins to provide congress with an annual report detailing the number of waivers granted each fiscal year and provides for the suspension of the attorney generals authority if an annual report is past

pick up the tab for irresponsible debtors debtors who are capable of paying off a significant portion of their debts this bankruptcy reform bill establishes a clear causal link between a debtors ability to pay and the availability of chapter 7 bankruptcy superdischarge it requires those who can afford to pay their debts to honor their commitments let me emphasize at the outset that individuals who make below the median income will not be forced into chapter 13 under this bill although they may still voluntarily choose to file there what this bill does do is require individuals who make above the median income and are determined to have significant repayment capabilities to file in chapter 13 there are people who truly have a legitimate need to declare bankruptcy no one is denying this at times hardworking people come up against special circumstances that are beyond their control family illness disability or the loss of a spouse may necessitate the need to seek relief this legislation effectively protects these individuals too frequently however people who have the financial ability or earnings potential to repay their debts are simply seeking an easy way out of repaying debts while this may prove convenient for the debtor it is not fair to their friends and neighbors who are ultimately stuck with the bill estimates show that the average american pays as much as 550 per year as a bad debt tax in the form of higher prices and increased consumer credit interest rates to cover the economic costs associated with the excessive bankruptcy filings of others nationally consumer bankruptcies reached a record 1 4 million in 1997 and those numbers have remained high what makes these statistics particularly alarming is the fact that this trend began in 1994 during a time of solid economic growth low inflation and low unemployment during an unprecedented peacetime boom in our economy the primary culprit of this dramatic increase in bankruptcy filings is a system that allows consumers to evade personal responsibility for their debts under this legislation individuals who can pay their debts will be moved to chapter 13 where they will be given a generous 5 years to establish a fair repayment plan and get their financial houses in order i would like to take this opportunity to thank the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from florida for their leadership in this area and i urge its passage"], [0.0022693276405334473, 0.5022693276405334, 1, "i yield myself 2 minutes first i want to express appreciation to our senior senator from west virginia for his interest and efforts in regard to the steel industry which have been tremendous and consistent and effective as this legislation which he is responsible for getting through the senate evidences our steel industry and steelworkers are in trouble foreign steel imports are up dramatically across the board from 30 to 41 million tons in 1998 hot rolled steel imports for example are up a staggering 66 percent three countries korea russia and japan account for 78 percent of this increase and much of it is illegal dumping selling in this country at a price less than the cost of actually producing it that is a violation of international trade law dumping has resulted in five of our steel companies in this country going bankrupt and 10 000 of our steelworkers losing their job 800 of these jobs at weirton steel in my district five companies 10 000 steel jobs all lost because of illegal dumping the legislation before us today addresses the short to mediumterm financial problems created for steel companies by this illegal dumping it establishes a program whereby the government will guarantee up to 1 5 billion in conventional loans 1 billion for the steel industry and 500 million for the ailing oil and gas industry the amount actually appropriated in the bill is 270 million which represents the subsidy rate and that is the amount of money actually estimated to be at risk should there be defaults loan guarantees are a tried and true approach to helping backbone industries get through troubled financial times remember when the congress passed the chrysler loan guarantee act of 1980 which supported a loan guarantee program of up to 1 5 billion chrysler borrowed 1 3 billion and successfully completed the program in likewise in 1981 lockheed was the object of a federally backed 250 million guarantee program also new york city benefitted from a successful 1 billion loan guarantee program some refer to these programs as the lockheed or the new york or chrysler bailout in fact none of these programs were bailouts all were guarantee programs which allowed lockheed chrysler and new york to work through their financial crisis and at the conclusion pay off their debts the government did not have to pay off one penny of those guaranteed loans steel manufacturing and oil and gas production industries are vital interests to our broad economic wellbeing not to mention to our national security interests it is perfectly appropriate for us to act reasonably to assist these industries using the loan guarantee model i urge adoption of the legislation i
