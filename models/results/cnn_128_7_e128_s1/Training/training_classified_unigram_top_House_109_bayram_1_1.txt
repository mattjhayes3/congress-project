international terrorismwhen we discuss this very important issuean issue of life and deathnot just for each of us individually but for our nation and way of lifeit is imperative that we begin our discussionat the beginning and that beginning wasnt on 911 weve been under attack for at least 30 years we did not want this fightwe did not invite this fightwe did not wish to engage in this battle however once our enemy crossed over the line confirmed for us and the worldthat they were unwilling to respect international law respect individual liberty respect sovereignty of nationsand that they were willing and desirous of engaging in mortal battleno other option was left to us or the civilized world abu musab alzarqawi on january 23 2005 said we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology so this discussion today comes down to a fundamental questionwhat is the appropriate strategy and tactic to adopt to win the war on terror will we withdraw and simply defenda policy of isolation and containment or will we aggressively combat terrorismand take the battle to our enemy this war is unlike any other in historywithout a doubt our enemy has no single home it recruits and trains its army from nations around the world the only unifying element is hatehate for the westhate for democracyhate for freedom of religionhate for liberty the only message our enemy understands is force period terrorists dont negotiateterrorists dont compromiseterrorists are not interested in peace to them thats weakness thankfully weve stayed the course thankfully weve persevered in both iraq and afghanistan the greatest threat to terrorism is freedom liberty and democracy in the middle east and beyond today the terrorists are truly on the run last week unitedstates and iraqi forces eliminated a qaeda in iraqs top terroristabu musab al zarqawi this was accomplished with excellent intelligenceknowing where the bad guys were and when and this information came from iraqi civiliansthat is a very positive sign this important step demonstrates many things we will hunt down terrorists and eliminate them wherever they are hiding the shackles of decades long terrorism are being removed from the middle east iraqi security forces are stepping up to the challenge iraqi citizens want to be free of terrorists and they are not going to sit idly by success breeds success never has that been more evident than this past week while zarqawi was eliminatedfinding him brought a treasure trove of information allowing unitedstates and iraqi forces to dismantle many more pieces of al qaedas puzzle success breeds success iraq just this past week selected 3 more officialscabinet ministersto serve in its standing government success breeds success it is also important for us to recall and reiterate why we are engaged in this war it is imperative during this debate that we reexamine the conditions that required the united states to take military action in afghan istan and iraq in the aftermath of the attacks of september 11 2001 just a short look at recent historyjust the last 27 yearsvividly demonstrates the death

attacks killed 3 025 unitedstates citizens and other nationals treating these incidents as crimesnot acts of warand providing reactionary measures rather than moving pro activelywill not work how do we know because that is precisely what we did for decadesand the consequence was 911 the attacks we witnessed that day serve as a reminder of the dangers we face as a nation in a post9 11 world we can no longer expect oceans between us and our enemies to keep us safe policy of containment has been proven to be a dismal failure just as the battle in afghanistan was not simply to remove the taliban the battle in iraq was not simply to remove saddam hussein and his murderous regime one has to look no further than the action of our enemy to see that we are fighting those who want to bring their brand of terror and fear to our shores we must not forget those threats that have been disrupted here at home and on our allies the west coast airliner plot the heathrow airport plot and the jose padilla plot the campaign against the united states and its allies is ambitious simple and clear terrorists will stop at nothing to achieve their distorted sense of reality now we could have easily stayed out of this conflict however giving terrorists free reign would not make us any saferhistory has proven that the price would be more innocent lives lostmore bombingsand not an ounce of peace we must not be held hostage by terrorismthat is not living in liberty and freedom there are defining moments every generation must face for this generation that defining moment is how we engage in this

captured the image of her abduction the defendant joseph smith the sarasota police questioned joseph smith who had been in their custody since the day after carlie was abducted on an unrelated parole violation a woman who said that she lived with smith was one of the tipsters who contacted the police of course the defendant refused to admit anything and refused to admit his involvement with carlie

charges he has been to the courthouse before aggravated battery carrying a knife possession of heroin with intent to sell possession of blank prescriptions possession of drugs without a prescription

where the state of florida has charged him with capital murder carlie brucia 11 jessica lunsford was born 4n gastonia north carolina she came to florida a year ago she was her grandmas girl grandma called her my daughter from the time she was one jessicas mother and dad split up about that time she and grandma ruth loved to go shopping together they would go to jcpenneys they would go to the mall and jessica lunsford especially liked walmart jessica wanted to be an olympic swimmer a fashion designer she would cut up old dressup clothes and make clothes for her dolls she and her grandma collected dolls together and would make clothes for them she loved the disney channel and she had a collection of disney videos she especially loved the princess diaries church was a big part of jessicas short life and she was a big part of the faith baptist church in homosassa florida she attended what is called the kings kids wednesday night program there were 35 kids in this bible school class and she was one of six who recently memorized the names of all the books of the new testament she even had a favorite verse memorized philippians 4 13 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me she was daddys girl and she would call her father mark lunsford as soon as she got home from school each day she would visit him at work and she liked to play in a sand pile just before she disappeared she had been to the state fair where mark had gone with her and bought that now famous pink hat that she has on in a photograph jessica did not like hearing about people being harmed and hurt and she never liked to see anybody cry jessica lunsford was a real person she was a little girl she was daddys girl she is shown in this photograph with that hat she had on that mark had given her nine years old life stolen from her because of a sexual predator that person john couey was a convicted sex offender he was staying down the street in a mobile home even though he did not use this as his registered address as he was required by law to do where he was staying was near the lunsford home and unbeknownst to the lunsfords he was on watch of their activities here is what he said he did he said he snuck into jessica lunsfords house through an unlocked door at about 3 oclock in the morning february 24 he kidnapped jessica and took her to his place his bedroom with jessica in his custody couey said that he watched the sheriffs command center pull up in front of the lunsford home he put jessica in his closet where he kept her till he was ready to abuse her he said after he was through with her he decided he would bury her after he learned that the citrus county sheriffs department was looking for him so the weekend after jessicas disappearance in rainy weather and fog he decided to do his dastardly deed of murdering this little girl after having his way with this 9yearold for as many times as he wished keeping her locked up in the closet he decided it was time to get rid of her so he took this 9yearold girl he tied her hands and feet with stereo wire he wrapped her inside two large plastic garbage bags he dug a hole and he buried her alive she suffocated to death jessica lunsford when she was found was still clutching the tiny blue stuffed dolphin she had taken from her bedroom when she was stolen in the middle of the night by john couey the police found where she had poked her fingers through the plastic bag seeking air to breathe that is the way that jessica lunsford died john couey well who is he he is a convicted sex offender with a criminal history a mile long it includes 24 arrests and goes back over 30 years two of the arrests were allegatiois of home invasions where he had molested little girls i have talked to mark lunsford at length he is a good guy he loved his daughter as all fathers do girlsare special to those of us who are fathers and he says he will never get over the fact that he lost his daughter and the way that she was murdered of courbe he will not get over it and hopefully none of us in this united states will get over it jessica lunsford 9 state of florida dylan and shasta groene were declared missing may 16 this year after police found the beaten and bound bodies of their mother their older brother and their mothers boyfriend shasta was discovered on july 2 just a couple of weeks ago in a local restaurant with joseph edward duncan iii of course a registered sex offender who had fled fargo north dakota human remains were discovered at a remote western montana campsite later and they were identified on

13yearold brother and their mothers boyfriend were beaten to death sheriff rocky watson has said he believes the motive for the killings was to acquire these two children for sex watson also said authorities believe the family was chosen at random but the attack was carefully planned and executed by the criminal f1 1800 the police have interviewed shasta the daughter a couple of times and the details are agonizing and slow in being revealed but she has provided helpful information sheriff watson does not go into all the facts and say what he believes happened to the girl and to dylan but those actions are not good dylan he was 9 like the others that i have mentioned he was a real person he wanted to live like all kids but he never made it to his 10th birthday because of the criminal this individual by the name of duncan duncan by the time he was 16 he had committed 13 rapes in 1980 duncan was arrested for breaking into a neighbors house stealing guns and then accosting a 14yearold boy and raping him at gun point he was convicted of rape and sentenced to the maximum of 20 years in the penitentiary however in lieu of prison somebody sent duncan to the sex offender treatment center at western state hospital in 1980 an evaluation at western state mental hospital found that duncan who was only 17 met the definition of a sexual psychopath western state hospital had given up on duncan he was 19 and he announced that he wanted to leave treatment and serve the rest of the time in prison so he served 14 years for the rape and three more for parole violations when he got out of the penitentiary he moved to fargo north dakota duncan after leaving the penitentiary he decided to create a blog on the internet and many of the entries appear to focus on his own sexual abuse crimes he seems to be proud of it and his rage over how sex offenders are treated in our community brenda groene and her boyfriend mark mckenzie and 13yearold slade groene were killed in their home some time on may 15 by joseph edward duncan iii they were beaten to death duncan after kidnapping shasta he told her what he did to these other three before he murdered them he said he had

trial he was caught trying to dig his way out of the jail he had stolen some type of metal object and was digging into the concrete floor he waits for his day in court sarah lunde 13 the assault on children continues the last example i would like to discuss occurred in houston texas it happened this year i want to read and paraphrase from different articles of the houston chronicle which relate the events better than 1 can according to the houston chronicle on february 4 2005 a 6monthold little girl showed up at texas childrens hospital severely abused physically and sexually and was put on life support by the hospital authorities she was only able to breathe because she was on a respirator this 6monthold little girl had been penetratedaiid raped vaginally and anally her tongue had been severed almost completely off the baby mind you six months of age was in critical condition at the hospital the babys parents were arrested put in police custody and charges have been filed against them according to the hospital authorities one said it is the worst case i have ever seen where a child has suffered such horrific types of injuries and is still alive the pain that this baby girl must have suffered doctors have found other signs of abuse since the babys admittance the parents who are not married are in their early 20s they took this child to doctors parkway hospital and told the staff she had some problems the medical staff obviously became suspicious of abuse and transferred the 6monthold baby and another child a 15month old the sister of the 6monthold to texas childrens hospital texas childrens hospital examined both of the kids and noticed that the 15monthold had an old broken rib and skull fractures childrens protective services took official legal custody of both girls and the 15monthold is now in foster care when the 15monthold was a month old she suffered a fracture to her leg she also had hemorrhaging in different parts of her body which was indicative of shaken baby syndrome according to child protective services they are not sure who did this so the father was charged with injury of a child in december 2003 but for some reason the case was dismissed in october once again this is the 15monthold daughter the mother had gone to some parenting classes and some therapy and told some officials that she had left the older child with the father and was living with her parents but for some reason the toddler was sent home to her mother these children are vulnerable they cannot tell anyone and they do not have anyone to turn to according to the houston chronicle the 6monthold was still fighting for her life she had been physically and sexually abused she was covered with brutal injuries according to the police she has been partly blinded by the injuries and now the parents ivan castaneda 22 and donna marie norman 19 are each charged with injury to a child and being held without bond if this 6monthold dies they would be charged with capital murder this little girl however is a remarkable person even though she had been admitted to the hospital in february her kidneys ceased functioning she was put on dialysis she had skull fractures injuries to her lungs liver kidneys and her eyes she continues to live and continues to live to this day i have talked to lieutenant stanley of the houston police and he said that the investigators investigating these cases are having difficulty handling the abuse that they personally saw however the 6monthold has defied all odds the reddishhaired infant described as the miracle baby has been released to a family that hopes to adopt her the baby has been in hospital for some time but according to a hospital spokesperson it was a great day because this child survived the most brutal of all attacks physically and sexually abused every part of her body bruised but some way she survived so they call her wonder baby six months she lived to the age of six months when she was physically and sexually abused but today she is still alive she is the only person i will talk about tonight that survived these brutal attacks these are just a few stories of real people real children in our communities that were preyed on by some sexual predator there is some hope however things are happening to protect children in the united states here in washington d c we have the national childrens alliance it was the idea of the gentleman from alabama who sits on the other side of the aisle proof that child abuse child protection is a bipartisan issue what this national childrens alliance does is protect children that have been abused and sexually assaulted throughout the country there are some 400 different centers where children who are assaulted sexually can go and be treated their medical and emotional needs can be met and they can be interviewed so criminal prosecution can take place against the perpetrator we probably have the best one of these centers in houston texas called the childrens assessment center the reason for these centers is this it used to be when i first started prosecuting cases and then when i was a criminal court judge when a crime was committed against a child especially a sexual assault crime the system continued to sometimes commit crimes against the child the justice system was not really justice for the kid what i mean is they would be interviewed by a police officer then taken to a hospital and interviewed by medical personnel they would sit in the emergency room with other people sometimes for hours then they would go downtown and be interviewed by the police and sometimes the children would be on the elevator at the police station and who else would be on the elevator the perpetrator going to be interviewed for the criminal conduct they would be bounced around all over the city interviewed by different prosecutors but now thankfully because of the national childrens alliance and the childrens assessment center in houston those days are over when kids are sexually assaulted they go to one center where all of their needs are met they are interviewed their physical needs are met when they are continuing to need more physical or mental therapy later they go back to this same center the people that are there are experts in child sexual assault cases and those people are available for trial when the perpetrator is caught and his day in court arrives that is some good news unfortunately we have to have these centers throughout the united states where children go who are sexually abused by the predators in our community this year before the house and the senate it was learned that money that goes to protect victims of crime was being depleted and removed from the budget let me explain in 1994 the president of the united states established what is called voca funding victims of crime act what that allows is for a person who is convicted of a federal crime they contribute moneys into a fund and that money goes to victims of crime for their medical and physical needs what a wonderful idea make criminals pay for the system that they have created by establishing this voca fund once again this is not money that is obtained from taxpayers it is obtained from criminals this year there was about 1 6 billion in the voca funding and there was an attempt and thought to remove this money and put it into the general fund thanks to the efforts of numerous victims groups throughout the united states and individuals on both sides of the aisle in not only the house but the senate that fund has been restored and victims organizations throughout the united states will be able to get that funding where does it go it goes to domestic violence shelters it goes to child abuse sexual assault centers like the childrens assessment center and numerous organizations that receive funds that criminals have contributed that is some good news we have also started this year the victims rights caucus i along with the gentlewoman from florida and the gentleman from california from the other side of the aisle have started the firstever victims rights caucus to raise the profile the plight of victims throughout the united states this is a good start it is important that judges throughout the united states be on the first line of defense of our children what i mean by that is when individuals are caught sexually assaulting our children and they come to court and they have their day in court and they are convicted judges need to understand they have a responsibility to punish those individuals we need to lock them up that is why we build prisons it may be important to prosecute thieves and drug dealers and all those other types of criminals but we build prisons to house and warehouse people who commit sex crimes against our children that is why we build those institutions and judges have an obligation to send them there the cases that i recited earlier many of them they had gone to prison but not for long enough because they got out and did it again we know the fact that almost everybody who goes to prison gets out eventually we also know this about sexual predators on our children that the overwhelming number of them when they leave the penitentiary repeat that conduct so we have an obligation when they get out of the penitentiary to keep up with them to track them so they can no longer haunt our schools our boy scouts our churches and our neighborhoods that is why i introduced legislation called the child predator act of 2005 this legislation requires registration of sex offenders throughout the united states when they cross state lines we lose them they fall through the cracks this legislation will require them to register when they move across state lines they must notify the community and by failure to notify they have committed a federal offense this act this bill has been incorporated in a larger bill sponsored by the gentleman from wisconsin sponsors from both sides of the house called the child safety act this bipartisan legislation when hopefully passed this summer is a measure that will protect the safety of children it will allow for the internet access of parents and law enforcement of those sexual predators that live in their communities states will be required to notify each other when an individual who is a sex offender crosses state lines there are numerous other provisions thatprotect children from sex offenders but basically we will track these individuals when they leave the penitentiary and we will track them for the rest of their lives that is the price they pay when they choose to commit a crime against children we know this about child predators they are slick they are cunning they are evil and they continue to repeat their conduct most sexual predators that show up at the courthouse that have committed sex crimes against children it is understood that they have committed several sex crimes against that one victim and that there are at least 10 other victims that they have committed sex crimes against there is a war on terror going on in this world and we say it is somewhere else we have a war on terror not only abroad but we have it at home the terror here they are child molesters they are the bad guys and they can no longer run and hide because we are going to keep up with them we know that they cannot be rehabilitated all statistics show that so if we do not keep them in prison we need to track them when they leave the penitentiaries it is probably the hope of most of us when we leave this world when we die that we want to be surrounded with the most important people in our life probably our kids this week i had my third grandchild born 2 days ago elizabeth i have four kids three girls a son and now three grandkids they are all very special to me i hope that when i die i am surrounded by those kids the worst thing i think that could ever happen to a parent is to lose a child and especially lose a child to a crime of violence but none of these children that i talked about tonight left this world surrounded by the people that love them they were found in holes in the ground dumped on parking lots thrown in rivers and lakes some of their bodies were burned the last person they saw on earth was not their mother their father their brother their sister but a sex offender that is the last person they saw before they died we need to be sensitive as a people to our children not just our own personal kids but the children down the street our neighbors kids we need to watch for them and protect them we have that obligation we have that moral and legal obligation as a people these kids these children they had the right to life they had the right to grow up play in their backyard go to school have a picnic run through the fields believe in santa claus play sports be in the school play be in the high s6hool prom find a mate all these things were stolen from all of the kids that i mentioned to you tonight and they were stolen by a child predator we must hold these criminals accountable for their conduct as a judge i heard all types of excuses by these sexual predators about why they did what they did those comments by those individuals were nothing more than excuses some of them said they had a bad childhood their mom was not a nice person they saw too much tv violence they played video games they watched the internet they continued to blame something or someone else for their own personal choices we now seem to live in the land of excusable conduct all of us are responsible for the choices that we make every choice we make we are personally responsible for that choice we are accountable for making those choices and those choices must result in consequences regardless of what that crime is our greatest resource in this country is not our oil it is not the trees in the west it is not other natural resources it is not our wealth the greatest resource we have in the united states is our children we as a people must realize that we are not judged by the way we treat the rich the famous the influential the important people in our culture we are judged by the way we treat the weak the innocent the children children are our greatest natural resource we have a legal and moral obligation to protect them the first duty of government is public safety and providing safety for children should be our primary concern and the duty of government i close the way i began this comment because i think the names of these people these real people these children are names that we should not forget dru sjoden 22 north dakota cary ann medlin 8 tennessee nicole parker 8 california chris byers 8 arkansas sherrice iverson 7

as well it just does not make any sense in fact one of the recommendations that came out of the subpanel that i served on was for the house to consider the sequestration of witnesses so that the factfinding process itself would not be colored by conversations among staff and members and as the gentleman knows it was a unanimous report and it was adopted unanimously by the house i hear sometimes comments about lack of due process that is a whole other issue but i am very proud of that product asi know my three colleagues were on the subpanel and not once did an individuals name ever appear in print not once there was not a leak because each of us understood the significance and the importance of taking this unpleasant task on in a role that reflected well on the house and

congressional district which is a rural district and in need of loans by small entrepreneurs there is a disappointment in the way the 7 a program is being administered e 2000 these fee increases particularly are causing lending to drop recent lending figures from sba show that entrepreneurs received 160 million less through the 7 a program for the first half of fiscal year 2006 when compared to the same period the previous year i dont know what you do with that statistic they are receiving less we are providing less funding and certainly the need is not less i can tell you in rural areas it is not over this same span entrepreneurs received 1 000 fewer loans demonstrating that fewer small businesses are able to benefit from the 7 a program fees increase businesses are responsive as consumers are responsive and of course businesses are consumers of this program when fees go up when costs goup people stop participating in the program that is marketplace economics at work here in a government program the damage to our economy is even more severe when you consider that the 7 a program is 500 million below where it was before the fee hikes were imposed another indication that the current program of charging fees and increasingly charging fees and continuing to charge fees and having increased four times in the last 2 years is resulting in the program not being able to be accessed the way it was in the past the gentlewomans amendment addresses some of these concerns and while we are in a tight budget this is an important program i rise to support it"],

in their hiring practices actually when faithbased groups hire employees on a religious basis they are actually exercising their civil liberties faithbased organizations cannot be expected to sustain

catholic church are we going to tell the catholic church whom they can hire and not hire for the good job they are doing that is exactly what we are trying to do here actually it will make it very difficult make them liable for hiring practices when in fact what they are doing is that they are giving back to society in the way that no government entity can actually give back in the way that these religious organizations are giving back so essentially going back to my basic argument since 1964 we have recognized this right of the religious organizations that are involved in these faithbased activities we cannot turn back actually from what we did in 1964 by trying to impose new rules that will simply impair their capacity to handle what they are handling today in such an able
