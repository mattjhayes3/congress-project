what they know about president clintons economic package the details of the polls show however that a very large number of the people support more spending cuts less taxes and more deficit reduction based on the mail and telephone calls in my office i can tell you that the overwhelming majority of my constituents favor more and substantial spending cuts before we consider raising taxes my purpose here today is to accept the presidents challenge to be more specific than he has been on potential spending cuts but first i would like to define the problem president clinton keeps asking his critics to give him specific programs that should be cut unfortunately its not that simple waste runs rampant through practically every existing program many of these programs are justifiable but could be run more efficiently president clinton talks a lot about change well if he has the courage to change i would ask him to make the most dramatic change of all we need to change the entire organizational

region to support itself through the workings of a strengthened freeenterprise economy it has turned into a kind of entitlement handout over the years 6 4 billion has been spent on this program and it

appeared in the august 1993 edition of the readers digest in the record immediately following my statement i recognize the arc will not be eliminated this year we had that vote last night and i congratulate the supporters of the program for a successful defenseof the arc however we can take the important step today of ensuring that the arc isnt expanded to include areas nowhere near the appalachian region h r 2442 includes the creation of a task force which will among other things study whether or not the arc format can work in areas like the ozarks or the mexicanborder region this

to build a mock mine structure where future coal miners can crawl around in a cramped dirty underground environment a similar structure price tag 498 000 was built in sumiton ala at the bevill state community college the trouble with such voced training is that mechanization and global competition have drastically reduced jobs in the coal industry arcs own statistics show that while production has increased from 1981 to 1991 the number of miners has plummeted from 172 000 to 89 000 the gao has criticized the arcsponsored programs which train workers for jobs that do not exist in appalachia thus forcing them to leave the region to find permanent employment in the end the voced program is just another wildly expensive port barrel thus the arch a moore vocational center in leroy w va got

district fourteen years ago the gao complained there was no yardstick for arc success no objective way to determine if the commission was even needed there are no constraints to prevent the appalachian states from believing the program will go on indefinitely the gao said indeed the arcs most remarkable achievement is its selfperpetuation it was supposed to be terminated in 1971 but

amendment therefore i do not object over the last year my home state of tennessee has experienced devastating drought followed closely by immense flooding in rural areas that forced many farmers to rely on federal assistance for survival other areas of the country fell victim to similar situations and congress often must pass emergency disaster assistance bills to pay for crop losses and other damage the federal crop insurance program was designed with the best of intentions but it is not working and we must make some reforms so that the taxpayers do not have to pay for emergency appropriations each time disaster strikes our nation the change made in this bill will improve the delivery and coverage of federal crop insurance programs by offering crop producers premiumfree catastrophic insurance coverage for crops one of the main reasons the current program is inadequate is because of lack of participation this bill provides strong incentives to encourage crop producers

prohibit any action under the act if it would result in a taking of private property directly relative to the piece of legislation we are debating this amendment would also provide for compensation to the property owner if the fair market value of the property is diminished by 50 percent or more as a result of a limitation on property use because of action taken under section 404 of the clean water act the endangered species act due to information from the survey which is the subject matter of the debate before the house the secretary and the landowner have a variety of options to use when it

americans that they will be compensated if government regulations cause them to lose the value of their property and if we are to succeed in protecting and preserving the environment we are going to

and go out and do what they are going to do to build more beds to house prisoners for serving 40 or 25 or whatever percent of their term but they are really going to in conjunction with building these

districts axe in danger and could lose all of their federal funding if they adopt as a policy or de facto not enforce the policy enunciated in the rohrabacher amendment second they do face losing all of their federal funds if either a teacher or the district fails to follow up on an accusation made by either a student or a parent that a child in the district is here illegally in this country finally i think the chairman of the committee on the judiciarys subcommittee alluded to this but it is a question of how quickly will the aclu or some other group bring a lawsuit against a school district or a teacher where there is a false accusation of a child being illegally in this country or where they are illegally here and dismissed from the school for that reason this just invites very expensive lawsuits against the school district and i think it is important just to get to the basic policy we are not saying here that the respect for law is not important we are saying here the issue
