syarhei kavalenka zmitser dashkevich pavel seviarynets mikalai autukhovich eduard lobov and mikalai dziadok while journalist andrzej poczobut has been released pending trial we believe that his arrest for illegally defaming the president was politically motivated and that the conditions imposed on his release are designed to further limit his ability to exercise his human rights moreover recent days have seen the surge of the offices of the union of poles and the confiscation of equipment supposedly related to mr poczobuts case we also recently have seen the arrest and detention and the release of journalist pavel sverdlov of the european radio for belarus for using foul language maybe we should consider that here sometimes such arrests and shortterm detentions are becoming an evermore common means to silence dissent in belarus increased restrictions on alex byalyatski and the court order issued july 4 for seizure of the offices of the vyasna human rights center are very disturbing belarus which already has applied travel restrictions on members of the opposition and human rights activists recently has taken another step to restrict the fundamental freedom of movement

majority has no right to inflict this operational outrage on the local funds of a local jurisdiction the district of columbia the majority may want to incur for the federal government the operational difficulties after all the district of columbia delivers services to federal officials including the president federal buildings foreign embassies and the like but does the majority really want to risk to put the district and its operations at risk or to place what wall street almost surely will do a risk premium on the district due to the uncertainty that we are at bay from cr to cr this is a fragile economy for every big city but d c s local budget was approved a year ago in the city and last summer by the appropriations committees yet the district of columbia is being held hostage to a

there is no disapproval of that here i wager that very few members even know that the district would close down if the federal government closed down would be perplexed by it would have no objection

to this point here today we spent days in important hearings analyzing the intelligence community making sure that we focused on what the intelligence community needed we knew as this country has an issue with respect to the deficit that we had to do some cutting its not about cutting it was what to cut and we wanted to make sure that the cuts that we made in this intelligence bill working as republicans and democrats would not affect the mission for the national security of our country we spent time before the bill passed hours and hours working staff working coming together and whats very unique also about this committee is that both the democrat and the republican staff worked very closely together and i hadnt seen that in the past as a member of this committee for over 9 years right now and thats one of the main reasons that we have such a great effective staff that work together as a team to come together to make sure that we did what we had to do now we are here today to finish the job republicans and democrats have come together to make important choices and to do what is right for the intelligence community and our country this bill makes america safer again i commend everyone who participated in this effort especially the bipartisan leadership of chairman rogers the other members of the intelligence committee and the leadership of senators feinstein and chambliss in the senate intelligence committee again working together we can do our work here but we need the senate to come together and we did and we now have the product here today i would like to

malpractice when they jammed through the congress and into law a washington takeover of health care they did so despite the overwhelming opposition of the american people since its enactment into law what was already a unpopular law has only continued to become more unpopular there is no doubt that we need to reform health care in america however it is not done by assaulting individual liberties

to be essential for health care and finally we are talking about health care not health care insurance as somebody who spent 10 years supervising the safety net for a community of 3 million in san diego county i just wish my colleagues on the other side when theyre worried about pediatricians and primary health care people would understand that if you really want to protect those providers why dont we sit down and talk about true tort reform especially for the pediatricians this is a cost that is bearing down and when youre asking young people to get an education to be a primary health care provider especially a pediatrician explain to them why somebody on public assistance on welfare has more right to sue their physician than those men and women who are serving in uniform the fact is there is no way that we should be sitting up here saying that we really want the next generation to get into health care unless were willing to tell our friends who are the trial lawyers that were going to take the physicians off the counter were not going to allow lawsuits to be part of the overhead that is driving people out of the health care business and i hope to say to both sides if you really want to make sure there are future doctors then lets have the bravery to stand up today and do something about the tort that those future doctors are looking at before they go into school"]]}
