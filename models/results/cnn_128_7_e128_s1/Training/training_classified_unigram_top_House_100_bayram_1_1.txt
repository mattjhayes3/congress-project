for a modernized landbased icbm force first some history in 1983 the scowcroft commissiona highly respected bipartisan group of strategic thinkersconvened to address the continuing problem of modernizing the landbased icbms this highly respected commission carefully reviewed the issues and concluded that attempting to solve all icbm issues with a single missile in a single basing mode made the problem of modernizing the icbm force so complex as to be virtually insoluble therefore the commission recommended a threepronged approach which suggested first prompt deployment of 100 mx missiles in minuteman silos to immediately reduce the soviet advantage in icbm capability second development of a small singlewarhead icbm to be deployed in the early 1990s in such a way to enhance survivability and stability and third vigorous investigation into followon icbm basing technologies to enhance future icbm survivability this approach was accepted by the president and unanimously supported by the secretary of defense the national security council the joint chiefs of staff the secretary of state and the congress which authorized the air force to proceed but as you know the bipartisan consensus did not last long congress decided to cap the deployment of mx missiles in silos at 50 due to continuing concern over survivability we also told the administration to look again at icbm survivability and gave the department of defense funds to explore alternative basing technologies along with the small icbm well the air force did exactly what we asked them to do they came back with another examination of icbm basing and this time combined the elements of mobility and deception we implored them to consider now we have before us the presidents proposal to develop a basing mode to garrison missiles in railroad cars on sac bases and to develop the small icbm this dual approach finally solves the icbm survivability problembut only if we allow development to proceed

exact words after seeing reagan walking arm in arm with gorbachev in red square i think the president is moving a lot closer to my views mr dukakis views who has no record in foreign policy whatsoever we are a lot closer together on soviet relations than he is with bush dukakis efforts to reposition himself as a reaganite says the washington post on foreign policy began at the democratic national convention where he saluted reagan for his achievements on arms control responding to bushs charge monday that dukakis is a stealth candidate hiding his liberalism from public view dukakis told reports that is bush who is the mysteryman do you know where he stands on southern africa i do he says do you know where he stands on the gulf i do and there are plenty of statements on the record and then he says do you know where he stands on central america then at the end he comes back and says that he has supported the endless fiasco of the freedom fighters in nicaragua for all of these years so he knows where he stands there on that one issue i will close this ridiculous page 4 article from the post that if dukakis wins freedom fighters efforts around the world are dead and dukakis even once drew his finger across his throat and said finished for these young men and women some of them teenagers why lay their bodies on the line and die for the freedom of their country now we are finally getting a piece of the cause of the reagan doctrine in angola in the gulf in iraq and iran at the northern end of the persian gulf and it looks like central america will be the last communist
