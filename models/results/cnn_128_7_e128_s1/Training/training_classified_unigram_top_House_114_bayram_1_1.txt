manslaughter and sentenced to life imprisonment even though the news of gosnells child slaughter was largely suppressed by the mainstream media many of my colleagues may remember that dr gosnell operated a large philadelphia abortion clinic where women died and countless babies were dismembered or chemically destroyed often by having their spinal cord snipped all gruesome procedures causing excruciating pain to the victim today the house considers landmark legislation authored by congressman trent franks to protect unborn children beginning at the age of 20 weeks postfertilization from these painfilled abortions the paincapable unborn child protection act is needed now more than ever because there are gosnells all over america dismembering and decapitating paincapable babies for profit men like steven brigham of new jersey an interstate abortion operatorsome 35 aborted babies were found in his freezer men like leroy carhart caught on videotape joking about his abortion toolkit complete with as he said a pickaxe and drill bit while describing a 3daylong lateterm abortion procedure and the infant victim as putting meat in a crockpot some euphemistically call this choice but a growing number of americans rightly regard it as violence against children and huge majorities60 percent according to the november quinnipiac pollwant it stopped fresh impetus for this bill came from a huge study of nearly 5 000 babies preemies published last week in the new england journal of medicine the next day the new york times article titled premature babies may survive at 22 weeks if treated touted the journals extraordinary findings of survival and hope just imagine preemies at 20 weeks are surviving as technology and medical science advances alexis hutchinson featured in the new york times story is today a healthy 5yearold who originally weighed in at a mere 1 1 pounds thus the babies we seek to protect from harm today may indeed survive if treated humanely with expertise and with an abundance of compassion i urge support for the legislation"], [1.704692840576172e-05, 0.9999829530715942, 1, "on april 24 we will mark the 100th anniversary of the armenian genocide 100 years ago 1 5 million armenians along with the syrians and greeks were slaughtered by the ottoman empire in the first genocide of the 20th century the sheer scale of genocide thwarts our capacity to comprehend it 1 5 million armenians killed 6 million jews killed in the holocaust 1 million tutsis the numbers become abstractions sanitized by their enormity it is only when we consider each of those lives individually that the full horror comes into focus the victims of genocide are more than victimsthey are human beings the armenians massacred from 1915 to 1923 were men women and children who were targeted in what was then an unprecedented campaign to wipe out an entire people it is our duty in the modern day to remember those lost and to bear witness that the campaign to destroy the armenian people failed we do so by speaking the truth and we do so by speaking the names of those 1 5 million and by keeping both the way they lived and the way they died alive in our memory earlier this month i asked my thousands of armenian constituents and millions of armenians around the country and the world to submit the names and stories of their family members who were killed 100 years ago the response was overwhelming thousands of people sent the names and stories of ancestors killed in the genocidethe names of infants and toddlers ripped from their mothers arms the names of children and the elderly dying of exhaustion and starvation on a forced march to deir ezzor the names of women and girls raped and brutalized and killed the names of clergy tortured and burned alive in their own churches the names of men robbed of their possessions of their homes and of their lives each victim has a name and a story from glendale to yerevan to jordan and every corner of the world where armenian diaspora lives families sent me those names and those stories it is my honor to read some of those names this hour knowing that it would take more than 1 000 hours more than 50 days to read all of them turkey may deny the genocide our administration may lack the courage to recognize the genocide our congress may lack the courage to recognize the genocide but no one can deny the humanity of its victims and no one can deny our right to speak the truth one hundred years ago 1 5 million armenians were killed in the armenian genocide these are their names george

you in this house with what i call a sunset memorial because you see before the sun sets today in america almost 4 000 more defenseless unborn children will be killed by abortion on demand in the land of the free and the home of the brave that is more than the number of innocent lives lost on september 11 in this country by a multitude of thousands and it happens every day it has now been 42 years since the tragedy called roe v wade was first handed down since then the very foundation of this nation has been stained by the blood of almost 56 million of its own unborn children some of them cried and screamed as they died but because it was amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we couldnt hear them all of them had at least four things in common first they were just little babies who had never done anything wrong to anyone each one of them died a nameless and lonely death and each one of their mothers whether she realizes it or not will never quite be the same all the gifts that these children might have brought for humanity and to humanity are now lost forever yet even in the glare of such tragedy this generation still clings to this blind invincible ignorance while history repeats itself over and over again and our silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victimsthose yet unborn we should remember the quotes of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve it not themselves and under a just god cannot long retain it mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember americas founding fathers when he said their enlightened belief was that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on or degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posterityand that is us mr speaker when in the distant future some man some factions some interests should set up a doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity again that is usmight look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began when authorities entered the clinic of dr kermit gosnell they found a torture chamber for little babies that defies description within the constraints of the english language according to the grand jury report dr kermit gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies he killed them now he didnt call it that he called it ensuring fetal demise and the way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors in the back of the babys neck and cutting the spinal cord he called it snipping over the years there were hundreds of snippings ashley baldwin one of dr gosnells employees said she saw babies breathing and she described one as 2 feet long that no longer had eyes or a mouth but in her words was making like this screeching noise she said it sounded like a little alien for gods sake is this who we really are kermit gosnell now rightfully sits in prison for killing a mother and murdering innocent paincapable children like the one i just described yet if he had killed them only 5 minutes earlier and before they had passed through the birth canal it would have all been perfectly legal in many of the united states of america including here in the district of columbia if there is one thing we must not miss about this unspeakably evil episode it is that kermit gosnell is not an anomaly he is just the visible face of this lucrative enterprise of murdering paincapable unborn children in america more than 18 000 very lateterm abortions are occurring in america every year placing the mothers at exponentially greater risk and subjecting their paincapable unborn babies to torture and death without anesthesia it is the worst atrocity in america today and this in the land of the free and the home of the brave throughout history there has often been great intensity surrounding the debates of protecting the innocent lives of those who through no fault of their own find themselves obscured in the shadows of humanity it encourages me greatly that in nearly all of those cases the collective conscience was finally moved in favor of the victims the same thing is beginning to happen in this debate related to innocent unborn children especially those that are pain capable we are beginning to ask ourselves the real question does abortion take the life of a child we are especially asking the question recently does very lateterm abortion torture and take the life of a paincapable baby and we are finally beginning to realize as human beings that it does ultrasound technology now demonstrates to all reasonable observers both the humanity of the victim and the inhumanity of what is being done to them and we are beginning to realize as americans that taking brutally the lives of the innocent unborn does not liberate anyone and that 56 million children is enough ironically i have heard barack obama speak such poignant words that whether he knows it or not apply so profoundly to the tragedy of abortion on demand in america let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged he went on to say and by that measure can we truly say as a nation that we are meeting our obligations can we honestly say that we are doing enough to keep our childrenall of them safe from harm can we say that we are truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives with happiness and purpose the president went on to say i have been reflecting on this the last few days and if we are honest with ourselves the answer is no we are not doing enough and we will have to change oh how true the presidents words are the president also said we cant tolerate this anymore these tragedies must end and to end them we must change and then the president asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom is this not the most relevant of questions we should all be asking in the midst of this genocidal murder of thousands of unborn babies in america every day the president has said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm finally he said that is our generations taskto make these words these rights these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted and yet this president in the most merciless distortion of logic and reason and humanity itself refuses to apply these majestic words to helpless unborn babies oh how i wish somehow that mr obama and all of us could open our hearts and our ears to his words and ask ourselves in the core of our own soul why his words that should apply to all children cannot apply to the most helpless of all children we honor abraham lincoln most because he found the courage as president of the united states in the days of slavery and he found the humanity within himself to recognize the image of god stamped on the soul of slaves that the supreme court said were not human and that the tide of public opinion didnt recognize as protectable under the law could it still be that president barack obama might consider that perspective as well as his own legacy and even eternity itself and recognize that those little unborn children look so desperately to him now for help could it be that the president might finally remember that on the pages of the bible on which he laid his hands were the words written in red inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me whether he does or not it is time for those of us in this chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here thomas jefferson said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without the due process of law the 14th amendment tells us that we should have equal protection of the laws for all protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights is why we are all here the bedrock foundation of this republic is that clarion declaration of the selfevident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with unalienable rights the rights of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness every conflict and battle our nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core selfevident truth it has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world it is truly who we are yet today another day has passed as so many sunset memorials that i have given another day has passed and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment we have failed our sworn oath and our godgiven responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4 000 more innocent unborn babies who died today without the protection we should have given them so let me conclude this sunset memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express and that it is time we stood up together again and looked up to the declaration of independence and that we remember that we are the same america that rejected human slavery and marched into europe to arrest the nazi holocaust and we are still the courageous and compassionate nation that can find a better way for mothers and their unborn children than abortion on demand it is still not too late for us to make a better world and for america to be the one that leads the rest of the planet just as we did in the days of slavery from this tragic genocide of murdering nearly 4 000 of our own children every day so now as we consider the thousands the hundreds of thousands out on the mall marching to protect these little babies as we consider the plight of the unborn for 42 years under roe v wade maybe we can each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are all numbered and that we too each one shall walk from these chambers one day for the very last time if it should be that congress is allowed to convene on yet another day may that be the day when we finally hear the cries when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children may that be the day when we find the humanity and the constitutional duty to protect these the least of our tiny little american brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our nation called abortion on demand it is now 42 years to the day since roe v wade first stained the foundation of this nation

timetested methods that for generations produced healthy thriving and vibrant forests these forest management practices prevented vegetation and wildlife from overgrowing the ability of the land to support them not only did this assure robust and healthy forests capable of resisting fire disease and pestilence but it also supported the prosperous economy revenues from the sale of excess timber provided a steady stream of revenues to the treasury which could in turn be used to further improve the public lands about 45 years ago we replaced these sound management practices with what can only be described as a policy of benign neglect in 1970 congress adopted the national environmental policy act that opened a floodgate of ponderous and byzantine laws regulations and lawsuits with the explicit promise that they would save the environment well after 45 years of these policies i think we are entitled to ask how is the environment doing well according to every scrap of evidence submitted to our subcommittee by a broad crosssection of experts the answer is that these laws have not only failed to improve the forest environment they have catastrophically harmed that environment surplus timber harvested from our national forests as a result of these laws has dropped dramatically since the 1980s while acreage destroyed by forest fire has increased concurrently and concomitantly wildlife habitats that were supposed to be preserved are now being incinerated precipitation that once flowed to riparian habitats now evaporates in overgrown canopies or is quickly claimed in the fierce competition of densely packed vegetation we have lost vast tracts of our national forests to beetle infestations as weakened trees can no longer resist their attacks the unitedstates forest service reports that in the tahoe basin in my district there is now four times the vegetation density as normal and trees that once had room to grow and thrive now fight for their lives against other trees trying to occupy the same ground revenues that our forest management agencies once produced and that facilitated our forest stewardship have all but dried up this has devastated mountain communities that once thrived from the forest economy while precious resources are diverted for lifeline programs like secure rural schools and pilt despite a growing population visitation to our national forests has declined significantly we can no longer manage lands to prevent fire or even salvage dead timber once fire has destroyed it appeals lawsuits and especially the threat of lawsuits have paralyzed and demoralized the forest service and created perverse incentives to do nothing to manage our lands the steadily deteriorating situation is forcing managers to raid forest treatment and fire prevention funds to pay for the growing costs of wildfire suppression creating a fiscal death spiralthe more we raid prevention funds the more wildfires we have the more wildfires we have the more we have to raid our prevention funds ironically our private forest lands are today conspicuously healthier than the public lands precisely because the private lands are free from so many of the laws that are tying the hands of our public foresters these laws may be making environmental law firms rich but they are killing our national forests h r 2647 is the first step toward restoring sound rational and scientific management of our national forests it streamlines fire and disease prevention programs and assures that firekilled timber can be quickly removed to create both the revenues and the room to restore firedamaged lands it protects forest managers from frivolous lawsuits in my district comprising the sierra nevada mountains in california two major

then he shows us that we open our arms to terrorists from all over the world so many americans gave their lives and gave their limbs for liberty in iraq for liberty in afghanistan in fact in afghanistan if i recall my figures correctly in the 714 years under commander in chief bush from october of 2001 until january of 2009 there were just over 500 precious american lives given for the cost of freedom in afghanistan supposedly we were told by this president the war was pretty much over he sent more troops for a while to afghanistan but even after supposedly the war has been over and troops have been left over there we keep getting americans killed it is because of the rules of engagement that so needlessly tie their hands it is because this administration would rather punish green beret sergeant first class martland for stopping a serial child rapist it would rather punish himthrow him out end his military careerbecause this administration at least here in this country does not want to offend the serial child rapist in afghanistan no wonder people around the world have lost so much respect for the united states in the last 7 years they know that stuff is going on they knew that sergeant martland stood up for the child and for the woman they knew what he did they spread the word then the word spreads when sergeant martland makes international news because this administration wants to punish him for dragging him out of the compoundnot killing not beheading not disembowelingin an act of defense of many third persons they find out this administration punished the military hero the green beret who protected the victims it is incredible i mean any administration that would do that would probably turn around and if it heard about some entity that was allowing unborn babies to be killed and was selling body parts might be tempted to punish the people who exposed it instead of punishing those who did such a heinous act those who have read scripture know there will come a time when right is wrong wrong is right the good are punished and the evil are rewarded but we also know the day will come when the ultimate judge of the world will set things straight so this is a story from martha mendoza maya alleruzzo and brain janssen from the associated press oldest christian monastery in iraq is razed this is heartbreaking this is a monastery americans were devoted to restoring it is a monastery where people came to know jesus of nazareth for the last 1400 years it is a place where god did miracles in peoples lives it is a place where our military were very very careful to protect because they knew the christian significance as this administration miscalculatedapparently our intelligence agencies did not miscalculate apparently our intelligence agencies made very clear to this administration that isis is not a jv team that these are dangerous people and they have to be stopped and you have to ramp it up so it wasnt our intelligence we didnt have bad intelligence the reports are out there the administration thinking it knew better than those on the ground in the area did not take isis seriously now this christian monastery over 1400 years old has been razed the story from iraq the oldest christian monastery in iraq has been reduced to a field of rubble yet another victim of the islamic state groups relentless destruction of ancient cultural sites for 1 400 years the compound survived assaults by nature and man standing as a place of worship recently for unitedstates troops in earlier centuries generations of monks tucked candles in the niches and prayed in the cool chapel the greek letters chi and rho representing the first two letters of christs name were carved near the entrance now satellite photos obtained exclusively by the associated press confirm the worst fears of church authorities and preservationistsst elijahs monastery of mosul has been completely wiped out in his office in exile in irbil iraq the rev paul thabit habib 39 stared quietly at before and afterimages of the monastery that once perched on a hillside above his hometown of mosul shaken he flipped back to his own photos for comparison i cant describe my sadness he said in arabic our christian history in mosul is being barbarically leveled we see it as an attempt to expel us from iraq eliminating and finishing our existence in this land the islamic state group which broke from alqaeda and now controls large parts of iraq and syria has killed thousands of civilians and forced out hundreds of thousands of christians threatening a religion that has endured in the region for 2 000 years along the way its fighters have destroyed buildings and ruined historical and culturally significant structures they consider contrary to their interpretation of islam i find it interesting that these writers know what leaders in this administration still after all these years have not figured out it is martha mendoza maya alleruzzo and brain janssen they point out in this article that these people believe that these sites are contrary to their interpretation of islam yet this administration says no it has nothing to do with islam the article continues those who knew the monastery wondered about its fate after the extremists swept through in june 2014 and largely cut communications to the area now st elijahs has joined a growing list of more than 100 demolished religious and historic sites including mosques tombs shrines and churches in syria and iraq the extremists have defaced or ruined ancient monuments in nineveh palmyra and hatra museums and libraries have been looted books burned artwork crushedor trafficked a big part of tangible history has been destroyed said rev manuel yousif boji a chaldean catholic pastor in southfield michigan he remembers attending mass at st elijahs almost 60 years ago while a seminarian in mosul these persecutions have happened to our church more than once but we believe in the power of truth the power of god said boji he is part of the detroit areas chaldean community which became the largest outside iraq after the sectarian bloodshed that followed the unitedstates invasion in 2003 iraqs christian population has dropped from 1 3 million then to 300 000 now church authorities say christians are under persecution being killed in greater numbers than any time in our history yet it is not the christians being persecuted in greater numbers than any time in history it is not the group that many in the world recognize are the most persecuted religion in the world this administration wants to welcome those of the religion of persecution rather than the most persecuted group in the world that being christians although just recently this article from cns news 550 syrian refugees admitted to unitedstates since the paris attacks and of the most persecuted highest number killed in the history of the world christians this administration admitted two an article from the texas tribune points out that governor greg abbott and my friend democrat unitedstates rep henry cuellar pressed the unitedstates department of homeland security on monday to explain why the agency plans to reduce its aerial surveillance on the texasmexico border mondays request comes as cbp is reporting a new surge in the number of undocumented immigrants crossing the rio grande from october to december of 2015 about 10 560 unaccompanied minors entered texas illegally through the rio grande valley sector of the unitedstates border patrol that marks a 115 percent increase over the same time frame in 2014 what is clear is that as this administration says oh we are arresting fewer people coming into the country illegally these kind of reports make clear well yeah if you close your eyes you will keep arresting even fewer that is what they are doing they are closing our eyes to our ability to see people that are violating our law at the same time we get this report from the washington examiner that sanctuary cities now cross the 300 mark with dallas and philadelphia added to it with so much to be depressed about i want to commend the people of the
