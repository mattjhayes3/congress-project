devoid of a sense of humor but generally most people show wonderful humor some in an extraordinary fashion when i became ill with a disease that would render me immobile and without voice i decided that i had a choice of being angry grouchy irritated rebellious or just plain ornery another choice was to laugh at myself be cheerful and try to see humor whenever possible the second was my choice which with the help of god i have tried to follow to the best of my ability at first i used to drop things and inwardly i would laugh at myself and think how clumsy i was while still able to walk i began to fall one day i fell in my room and could not get up on my chair like a snake i crawled and wiggled slowly on the floor until i reached the phone i blindly knocked the receiver off the hook and dialed the operator when i heard a voice i asked her to send someone to pick me up shortly after i had to go to the nursing home of the franciscan sisters of the sacred heart many humorous events happened during my stay there for over a year one day nurses and aides were helping me from my bed to my reclining chair when suddenly my knees buckled and my helpers lost their grip i was falling when a aide pulled me to the chair where i sat down but to her surprise and mine on her lap in spite of my scary experience i laughed to relieve the distress of the nurses and especially to relieve the embarrassment of the young aide because of weak neck muscles my head used to bobble up and down and move sideways when my helpers moved me i would hit my head on them the wall or the towel rack as a joke i began to count the bumps the nurses and aides would ask me how many times does that make i stopped counting when i reached 120 during my two and onehalf years of helplessness in the nursing home and hospital there were many times my fingernails had to be cut it amused me to have someone cut my nails when her own nails were so long that a bald eagle would love to have them as his talons of course this is an exaggerat ion but some really have nails that are long and sharp sometimes one has the tube for suctioning phlegm from my mouth while another is lifting my leg for exercise and

percussion to loosen the phlegm by pounding on my rib cage with both hands i try to picture the rhythm of african bongo drums each day priests come to lift me from and back to my bed so that i can assist at mass from a reclining chair this is a painful procedure one day after a very difficult time one priest said we didnt do so well today after putting me back in bed they saw me laughing the priest said i guess it wasnt so bad after all another priest replied dont be fooled the more it hurts the more he laughs since it was lent i said for my penance i shall get up an extra time daily one day the scripture reading and homily were about god touching us with his finger the homilist applied this to those with trials difficulties illness suffering etc after mass i with a smile spelled out the following comment in my case it seems that god touched me not only with a finger but used both hands many other things have happened which if written could fill several books but this was written
