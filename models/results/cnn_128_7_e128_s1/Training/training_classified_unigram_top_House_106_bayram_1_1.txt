national police state by further expanding a federal crime to include amongst the list of controlled substances that of ghb a nutrient used for 25 years with beneficial effects for those suffering from cataplexy insomnia narcolepsy depression alcoholism opiate addiction and numerous other conditions of course it is much easier to ride the current wave of federalizing every human misdeed in the name of saving the world from some evil than to uphold a constitutional oath which prescribes a procedural limitation by which the nation is protected from what is perhaps the worst evil totalitarianism who after all and especially in an election year wants to be amongst those members of congress who are portrayed as being soft on drugs or rape irrespective of the procedural transgressions and individual or civil liberties one tramples in their overzealous approach our federal government is constitutionally a govemment of limited powers article one section eight enumerates the legislative areas for which the unitedstates congress is allowed to act or enact legislation for every other issue the federal government lacks any authority or consent of the govemed and only the state governments their designees or the people in their private market actions enjoy such rights to govemance the tenth amendment is brutally clear in stating the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people in his first formal complaint to congress on behalf of the federal judiciary chief justice william h rehnquist said the trend to federalize crimes that have traditionally been handled in state courts threatens to change entirely the nature of our federal system rehnquist further criticized congress for yielding to the political pressure to appear responsive to every highly publicized societal ill or sensational cdme even if ghb is as potentially dangerous as the bills advocates suggest punishing possession of a useful substance because it potentially could be used in a harmful manner is as inconsistent with liberty as criminalizing the possession of handguns and cars moreover this bill empowers health and human services to engage in a national propaganda campaign on the dangers of ghb creates a special unit with the drug enforcement agency to assess abuse and trafficking in ghb and authorizes the justice department to issue taxpayerfunded grants for the development of police officer fieldtest equipment aside from being further abuses of enumerated powers doctrine the substantive questions raised by this legislation make these usurpations of state government authority even more reprehensible additionally this act undermines the recentty enacted dietary supplement health education act dshea at the expense of thousands of consumers who have safely used these natural metabolites of the amino acid gaba according to practicing physician ward dean west point graduate and former delta force flight surgeon hr 2130 appears to be a case of pharmaceuticalcompanyprotectionism because the substances restricted under this act are natural and hence nonpatentable the pharmaceutical concerns lose marketshare in areas for which ghb is a safer and less expensive means of treating numerous ailments in a recent letter from dr dean he states i have extensive experience in the clinical use of gamma hyudroxy butyric acid ghb i have used these substances for over ten years on hundreds of patients and have advised thousands through my books and articles on the subject i have not had one instance reported to me of adverse effects in my patients ghb is the safest most nontoxic sleep inducing substance known it has a wide range of other therapeutic uses the therapeutic threshold for ghb is greater than almost any known pharmaceutical substance the ld50 is 40100 times greater than the sleepinducing therapeutic dose of 36 grams it is incongruous to me that a substance with such a wide range of documented benefits that is so overwhelmingly safe can simultaneously be both a schedule i and a schedule i substance ghb is a naturally occurring substance present in all mammalian tissue as well as many foods consequently everyone is in possession of this controlled substance and every grocery store that sells meat is in possession with intent to distribute these are not frivolous statements in states where glb is a schedule i substance there have been several instances where the charges have been dropped by the prosecution upon receipt of documentation that ghb is in beef from the state in question i believe alleged violations of this proposed federal law will be equally difficult to successfully prosecute although gib has been claimed to have been responsible for a small number of deaths many of these cases are questionable this is due to the fact that ghb is produced in significant quantities by the body post mortem and is readily detectable in 96 out of 100 deceased persons even when no ghb has been consumed for each of the aforementioned procedural and substantive reasons i must again oppose h

is not the united states the totalitarian communist dictatorship in power since 1959 is not a democratic government the regime treats children by law as political raw material to be manipulated and exploited by the state children are forced from infancy to prepare for the defense of the country and its regime parents who follow their conscience and try to shape their childrens values and education are considered enemies of the state and are arrested or persecuted those parents whose love for their children supersedes any individual concern for their safety are punished by the castro regime punished for violating castros laws laws such as the code of the child and youth established by law number 16 published on this law reiterates the requirement that the young generations must participate in the construction of socialism and that the communist ideological formation of children and youth must take place through a coherent system in which the cuban communist party assumes the pivotal role of vanguard and protector of marxistleninism those are the exact words the upbringing of cubas children in other words is the responsibility of the cuban communist party based on this premise the code of the child and youth dictates in its first article that the people organizations and institutions which take part in their education are obligated to promote the formation of the communist personality in the young generations that is their quote if any doubt exists as to the true nature of this code article 3 states that the communist ideological formation of the young generation is a primary goal of the state and as such the state works to instill in them quote loyalty to the cause of socialism and communism and loyalty to the vanguard of marxistleninism the cuban communist party by the same token the state must develop in the children a sense of honor and loyalty to the principles of proletariat internationalism again these are their words and the fraternal relations and cooperation with the soviet union and other socialist communist countries absolute adherence to marxism is the crux of the educational system in cuba article 8 for example underscores that society and the state work for the efficient protection of youth against all influences contrary to their communism formation the regime equates karl marx with cuban independence hero jose marti to mask the content of article 14 of the code albeit unsuccessfully article 14 condones and advocates child labor as it dictates the combination of study and work is one of the fundamentals on which revolutionary education is based the principle is to be applied from infancy in this manner cubas youth acquire proper labor habits and other aspects of the communist personality are developed the supremacy of marxism is irrefutable as evident in article 33 the state bestows particular attention to the teachings of marxismleninism for its importance in the ideological formation and political culture of young students is this the totalitarian society where the communist party and the state dictates the education the upbringing of every child is this what our justice department our ins and

proclaiming the gospelthe good news of jesus christand its message of love hope and reconciliation the holy father walks the path to peace that surpasses understanding the road that leads to heaven how appropriate it is that we honor him with a congressional gold medal as he just celebrated his eightieth birthday last week even after eight decades of doing the lords work here on earth the popes charisma and steadfast faith shine brightly giving hope to millions of people of all faiths during his pontificate the holy father has made an astonishing 176 visits to 117 different countries he speaks some eight languages and has written 13 incisive encyclicals he is truly a world leader and an unparalleledchampion of those who cannot speak for themselves the poor the unborn those condemned to death and those whose basic rights as children of god are trampled upon by oppressive regimes he waged an unrelenting crusade against the forces of atheistic communism and continues to preach the message of life hope and love amid the oppressive tide of the culture of death pope john paul is encyclical the gospel of life evangelium vitae reminds all of usespecially those in public servicethat the gift of human life is so precious so full of dignity that it must remain inviolable and be defended against all manner of violence the pope writes in that important document that this is what is happening also at the level of politics and government the original and inalienable right to life is questioned or denied on the basis of a parliamentaryvote or the will df one part of the peopleeven if it is the majority this is the sinister result of a relativism which reigns unopposed the right ceases to be such because it is no longer firmly founded on the inviolable dignity of the person but is made subject to the will of the stronger part and elsewhere in evangelium vitae pope john paul ii states in unambiguous terms abortion and euthanasia are thus crimes which no human law can claim to legitimize there is no obligation in conscience to obey such laws instead there is a grave and clear obligation to oppose them by conscientious objection in the case of intrinsically unjust law such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia it is therefore never licit to obey it or to take part in a propaganda campaign in favor of such a law or vote for it in the kingdom of god that civilization of life which john paul ii has so fervently sought to build there is no place for the systematic killing of unborn children my family and i have had the awesome privilege of meeting the holy father in newark new jersey in the crowd in 1979 at new yorks shea stadium and most recently in guatemala i have personally witnessed and been inspired on numerous occasions by his power that comes from being so rooted in god and so devoted to the service of others pope john paul ii is truly the vicar of christ on earth a man who has and continues to faithfully and courageously walk in the shoes of the fisherman peter it is said that the holy father has had no personal bank account since being ordained a priest over 50 years ago he has truly stored up treasure in heaven and we are all better people
