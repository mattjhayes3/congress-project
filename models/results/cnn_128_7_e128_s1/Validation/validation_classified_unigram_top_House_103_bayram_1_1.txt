is between radical governmentrun health care as presented in the clintongephardt the clintonmitchell and all the variety of bills thereof if the choice is that or doing nothing they would rather us wait and start over in the next congress and so what i support is a deliberative process i support action i support reform now if it is the right kind of form the american people are saying i think we

boost to school reform in the united states the legislation would implement the presidents education reform proposals called goals 2000 educate america act under the bill 393 million in grants would be awarded to the states as an incentive to improve their elementary and secondary schools each state could apply for these funds through the development of state plans which set standards for education the bill would require states to establish standards of contentor what children should know in english math or other subjects at certain points in their education local school districts would also be eligible for subgrants from the state to develop and implement comprehensive reform at the local school district level as well the bill further establishes a national education goals panel charged with building a national consensus for education improvement and reporting on the nations progress in meeting the national education goals never before has our nation had standards for what students should know these standards will enable america to set voluntary goals for which all students can strive the bill also establishes a national education standards and improvement council this council would develop criteria for certifying voluntary national content student performance and opportunitytolearn standards as well as standards developed and voluntarily submitted by the states these national standards would become available for use by states as guides or models in developing or modifying their academic standards the bill further establishes a 28member national skill standards board intended to serve as a catalyst in stimulating the development of a voluntary system of skill standards the board will encourage and facilitate the establishment of voluntary businesslaboreducation partnerships to develop skill standards systems the bill further provides that the skill standards meet or exceed the highest standards used in other countries h r 1804 is a departure from the way the federal government has previously dealt with education not only does the bill call for voluntary national standards but it calls for the relaxing of regulations and

back home that has been so effective in this congress let us be honest liberals hate grassroots voter pressure it was voter pressure in support of home schooling that forced the liberals to pull out a provision that would have killed home schooling it is the grassroots pressure of the righttolife movement that has sustained a fight that liberals would have crushed years ago it is the grassroots pressure of people who believe in the second amendment which has stopped the efforts by liberals to strip americans of the right to bear arms it has been the opposition to the clinton tax increase by the grassroots which reduced it to a onevote margin when the entire power structure of washington was going to raise taxes on the american people again and again whether it is school prayer opposition to prohomosexual education in first grade or a range of issues which are not politically correct here in washington it has been the grassroots who have risen up the crowning blow to liberals was the

a licensed gun dealer to sell and give handguns to minors however it does not address the very real situations where other people sell and give handguns to minors the current law also does not make it illegal for the minor to possess the handgun the youth handgun safety act makes it illegal for anyone to sell or transfer a handgun to a minor and it makes it illegal for the minor to possess the handgun there are several exceptions for hunting target practice or instruction in the safe use of handguns while under the supervision of an adult but beyond that youths would not be permitted to

from embezzlement to conspiracy to selling cocaine in the house post office we know that there were serious problems there for the chairman of the house administration committee to make the statements

serious problems in the post office we were not informed of it until almost the end of january 1992 when the story broke in the washington times at that time we asked for the information to be laid out before us now although there is a criminal investigation that is going on and rightfully should we as members of this institution have a responsibility to ourselves to this institution and to the

care providers these include 36 bombings 81 arsons 131 death threats 84 assaults 2 kidnappings 327 clinic invasions and 1 murder over 6 000 clinic blockades and other disruptions of clinic activity were reported during that period just this past march dr david gunn of florida was shot and killed murdered by an antiabortion activist this past august dr george tiller was shot and wounded in oregon because he performed legal abortions at a reproductive health clinic and just last month a 19yearold youth set fire to a texas clinic causing 50 000 worth of damage this was the ninth womens health center to be damaged by fire so far this year these acts of violence do not only hurt those directly hit they also affect the thousands of women who need to use these clinics for their health care more than 90 percent of the clinics that have experienced blockades or violence also provide other health services in addition to abortions and many of the clinics targeted for blockades and harassment are located in rural areas they are frequently the only source of reproductive medical care for the women they serve disruptions in the operation of these clinics has therefore deprived many women of a wide range of badly needed medical services including pregnancy and prenatal care while it is true that most state and local law enforcement have the authority to police such violations of their criminal codes in reality this often does not happen in some cases the locality does not have the resources to battle largescale longterm interstate lawlessness including trespass vandalism and assault in other cases they simply choose not to do so clearly a federal remedy is the only answer if we are standardize law enforcement and offer all clinics the same protection until early this year federal courts could act to restrain clinic blockades but once the supreme court ruled in the bray decision that the ku klux klan statute no longer offered protection to clinics and providers we were left with no legal means of ending the disruptions no way to keep these clinics open and safe for women their doctors or nurses and no way to guarantee this constitutionally

bring swarms of locusts and will make the seas boil in the words of that great statesman yogi berra its like deja vu all over again before we take their criticism to heart i think we should check the record and see how accurate their predictions turned out to be last year let us recall some of the words we heard from republicans during last years budget debate one republican told us that the presidents budget would lead to and i quote a jobkilling recession another told us that the budget was clearly a jobkiller in the short run and that the impact on job creation would be devastating another said that the budget would mean and i quote again a higher national debt deficits running 350 billion a year more unemployment higher interest rates and higher inflation speaker after republican speaker repeated the same exact line and one gentleman even said to those of us who voted for the plan this is now your package we will come back here next year and try to help you when this puts the economy in the gutter well guess what next year is here the budget has had time to take effect and each and every one of their predictions has fallen flat on its face the truth is that today interest rates are down and homes sales are up inflation is down and auto sales are up unemployment is down and incomes are up and all told our economy has created more jobs in the past year alone than in the 4 years of president bush combined last summer the socalled experts were predicting that if we passed the presidents budget this years deficit would be 300 billion well the experts were wrong because we passed the plan this years deficit is projected to be under 180 billiona 40percent drop and if we stick with this plan we will post 3 consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since harry truman lived in the white house thats a good start and more needs to be done much more needs to be done but it just goes to show that when you make tough choices you get

care plan now they did not get it then and they dont get it now well the american people get it they want a health system that covers everyone and provides all americans with health insurance that can never be taken away they want a health care system controlled by people who care about our health not just our wallets they want a system that protects and expands medicare and lets people choose their own doctors and health plan and want a health care system that everyone can depend on every day always after 50 years of starts and stops thats the plan president clinton has proposed for

within the next 6 years let me take a few minutes to explain the elements of the series transition payment program in simple terms this programn authorizes the secretary of transportation to pay for the difference in cost between building a vesse which is one of a series in a unitedstates shipyard and building that same vessel in a foreign shipyard a similar construction program in the 197080 timeframe resulted in a tremendous number of ships being built in unitedstates shipyards with the defense buildup in the earlier 1980s our shipyards were essentially converted to naval shipyards these naval ships were often one of a kind and highly sophisticated both in terms of design and weaponry while our shipyards were committed to a naval building program our for sign competitors were building commercial vessels these commercial vessels were not one of a kind but instead were of similar design and specifications this is a critical difference because in shipbuilding as in any heavy

have in effect been building commercial vessels in series for the last 10 years typical the learning curve cost savings over the frst four to five ships in a series before it flattens out is in the 2025 percent raage the savings in manhoum between the first hip in a series and later ships is well domnented a wellknown naval architect dr loyd bergeson analyzed manhour data compiled from 15 shipyards that were dedicated to the construction of liberty ships in world war i the average manhours per shig for all 15 shipyards for the first ship in the series was 1 120 000 the fourth ship in the series averaged 725 0w manhours and the eighth ship averaged 580 00 manhours n another study comparing united states and japanese shipyards the amthor dr howard bunch concluded that the japanese comparative performance advantage whe traceable to the fact the japanese yards have developed concepts of standardlzatten and modularlsaton that permit a law portion of the deeg and engineering activities to be essentially the retrieval of the documentation from fies standardization of designs and overcoming the learning curve are the twin goals of the stp program let me comment on two other points concerning the current stp proposal first a drafted priority for award of contracts is given to those shipyards that can reach the world market price with the fewest number of vessels in the series and with the smallest contribution from the federal government thus unlike the old constructionillfferential subsidy program the stp program establishes mitre unitedstates shipyard competition second a unitedstates shipyard that seeks a transition payment must have two contracts in hand before applying for aid and must demonstrate that upon completion of the vessels in the series that it will be capable of constructing additional vessels of the same type at the world market price and without assistance now with respect to labor rates our shipyards are in fact competitive now for instance the average per hour wage level in germany is 26 50 in italy the average hourly wage in 1990 was 19 22 in japan the wage level was 15 80 per hour in the united states the wage level was 15 50 per hour wages are no more a problem than they are for bmw or mercedes who are relocating their plants to south carolina and alabama respectively if we can in fact overcome the learning curve through the stp program then i am personally convinced we can once again become a major shipbuilding power finally i do not want to mislead anyone here today the stp program will not without more congressional action suddenly end our foreign competitors n0year monopoly of commercial shipbuilding you should also note that our commttee has not requested a specific funding level for the series transaction program this is a conscious decision on our part first because negotiations are currently taking place in eurole between the united states and the european community concerning shipbuilding we did not want t tie the hands of the president in those negotiations in simple terms the appropriation level requested in the presidents budget for fiscal yar 1995 will ber dependent on the outcome of these negotiatiomsa if the negotiations are auecessful then we will need to fund a smaller sum of money to overcome the learning curve phenomenon if however our competitors continue their sub rose subsidies then we will need to look at a higher number the actual funding levels for the stp program will not come util fiscal year 1995 and of course will be subject to additional debate and additional vetes many of you hear in statement after statement that we have effected a delcate balance and that we cannot change this section or that sectionor the whole bill will become unraveled with respect to the current unitedstates shipbuilding requirements in h 2151 1 sincerely believe we have a true compromise that deserves a chance to work i know the vast majority of our unitedstates shipyards are willing to make these provisions work i think most of the operators can work within this framework i just hope that my elleagues and the administration will give it a

principal purpose of the bill which will be explained at greater length in a minute it to permit the exportimport bank whichnow cannot finance any defense good and service unlessit is used solely for civilian purposes or is used primarily for antinarcotics purposes to consider financing for defense goods and services that are nonlethal but only ih the narrow set of circumstances when the unquestionably primaryuse will be for civilian purposes without this legislation we do not have a unitedstates government export finance program that can accommodate dualuse items that are used primarily for civilian purposes h r 4455 as amended was passed by the committee on banking finance and urban affairs on june 29 1994 by voice vote it was reported by the subcommittee on international development finance trade and monetary policy on june 24 by a vote of 17 to 0 the amended version includes the provisions of my original bill h r 4455 and other provisions added to respond to concerns raised by members in the course of the hearing and other consideration of h r 4455 in section 3 the amelnded bill also includes a separate provision added by representative kennedy relating to eximbank promotion of exports of environmental goods and services the original bill corresponding to the first fourteen lines of the amended bill provides an exception to the current prohibition on eximbank financing of exports of defense articles and services but only in cases where the article to be exported is both nonlethal and the primary end use is for civilian purposes thus the bill provides a narrow exception to the current law and it is this members intention to keep the exception narrow this member does not consider the eximbank to be an appropriate agency for financing defense sales for primarily military purposes nor for sales of lethal items many other members share this view an example of an item which cannot now be financed by eximbank but which would be permitted if this bill is passed is radar for air traffic control systems if the radar feeds into both civilian and military air traffic control systems the bill would allow such export sales to be considered for eximbank financing as long as the primary use is for civil air traffic control it does not make sense to cede to our trade competitors the whole field of hightechnology dualuse electronics when the military use or involvement is clearly secondary and subsidiary to the civilian use this step is consistent with the direction of conversion that many defense industries are seeking and being encouraged to pursue and the current inflexible policy impedes export sales of such nonlethal dualuse items that are destined primarily for civilian purposes the bill is supported by the aerospace industries association and the electronic industries association among others six items have been added to the original bill in an abundance of caution first there is a requirement that each transaction proposed for financing under this exception must be reported to the house and senate committees on banking and on appropriations at least 15 calendar days in advance of final approval by the eximbank board of directors this is similar to the reporting requirement of the appropriations committees this provision has been included to respond to the desire of members that close ongoing congressional oversight of the implementation of this provision is needed in order to ensure that this discretion is properly and narrowly construed second as an additional safeguard the provisions of this legislation will sunset on september 30 1997 at that time after about 3 years of experience it will be timely to assess whether this provision should continue in law in the context of the next full reauthorization of the exportimport bank third as a further safeguard against crowding out of other commercial sales the bill limits the amount of eximbanks funding that can be devoted to funding the sales made possible by this bill the cap is set at 10 percent of eximbanks available subsidy appropriation under credit reform fourth the gao will be consulting with eximbank annually and reporting on the end use of articles financed under this provision to provide a followup assessment of the actual use of articles financed fifth section 2 of the amended bill requires a quarterly report on any transactions financed under the authority provided in the earlier part of the bill eximbank already files a quarterly report with the two banking committees on any transaction involving a defense sale which will be used solely for civilian purposes the transactions financed under section 1 of the bill would be added to this quarterly report lastly in section 3 there is a provision on eximbank promotion of exports of environmental goods and services added by representative kennedys amendment during committee consideration this provision was also the subject to a separate hearing by the subcommittee earlier this year in response to questions raised by members at the hearing about the necessity of guarding against fraudulent representation of the primary end use of a sale our staff had lengthy discussions with eximbank personnel about the current eximbank practice in assessing sales with military potential the committee expects the exportimport bank to contfnue its present policy of working with other appropriate unitedstates government agencies to review transactions with military sales potential to determine whether they meet the standards established in this legislation regarding nonlethal nature and the primary end use being for civilian nurposes the bank is expected to continus its present practices of investigating the prospective use of dualuse items and those buld to military buyers requiring the buyer or user to provide a certificate that the use the article or service satisfies the requi ments of the legislation assessing whether civilian use is primary according to a standard requiring unquestionably and strongly predominant civilian use monitoring the actual use of the items especially if there is any reason to suspect that the actual use does not conform to the agreed use requiring accelerated repayment of loans if the buyer has misrepresented the intended use and using other available sanctions such as debarring from access to future exportimport bank credit any buyer or user that violates agreed limitations on the nature or use of the defense articles or defense services financed by the bank the banking committee expects that the eximbank will continue these prbcedures with respect to transactions financed under h r 4455 in order to guard against and deter any fraud and misrepresentation the committees understanding of the term end use is the intended application or use of an item or service as represented by an applicant for financing from the exportimport bank it is worth noting that h r 4455 only addresses the question of export finance any sale of controlled items requiring export licensing still must have whatever licenses are required before being eligible for export with or without eximbank financing it is further worth noting that while the bill slightly widens the universe of goods and services that eximbank is allowed to finance eximbank would not have to provide financing in any particular situation it would still be using its normal financial standards to assess the merits of a particular export deal again this member would like to thank the chairman the gentleman from massachusetts and a number of other members including appropriation chairman obey and representatives kfnnedy and watt for their assistance and that of their staff in crafting amendments to the original bill in a form that apparently satisfies their concerns about oversight concerns about crowdingout of other lending and concerns about guarding against abuse adoption of this bill will help bolster unitedstates exports of dualuse goods for primarily civilian purposes and create and sustain good high skill jobs in the united states as i prepare to yield my time i cannot help mentioning the fact that a very

robeson county and in all of north carolina however i rise today to oppose this bill i represent a district which encompasses the area of the eastern band of the cherokee indians in the early history of our nation congress and the administration often abused the american indians of this nation in my district andrew jackson tried to move the entire cherokee nation to oklahoma many died while walking the trail of tears which many people have heard about they are remembered in a drama on the cherokee reservation by those that stayedthat is those that evaded capture by the soldiersand those that returned back to western north carolina as we have heard before the bulk of indian tribes were established by treaty many of them following wars in this country what does it mean to be a federally recognized tribe it is a formal act that establishes a governmenttogovernment relationship between the united states and the recognized tribe it institutionalize the tribes quasisovereign status giving it the power to tax and to establisk a judiciary and it gives the tribe the right to treatment as a sovereign nation this relationship is unique in the world tribes view it as almost sacred many american indians died for this right it must be taken seriously and protected the history of federal recognition of indian tribes has been plagued with pitfalls and perceived as arbitrary and excessively political in 1975 the interior department after exhaustive consultations with indians established procedures to provide a uniform approach to the recognition process called the federal acknowledgement process fap the regulations set forth seven criteria a petitioning group must meet to be deemed a recognized tribe including a historical genealogical and cultural background what we would be doing today with this bill is to replace that orderly procsea and again return to a method where recognition is granted for arbitrary and political reasons this would be done contrary to the wishes of the majority of the american indians let there be no mistake about this vote this is a vote against the american indians not for them the cherokee nation the eastern band of which are located in my district strongly opposes this bill the hatteras tuscarora located among the lumbees in robeson county have stated that they oppose this bill under h r 334 they will be subsumed but they want to apply for tribal recognition through the fap process i bave received letters that support the fap process and a strict adherence to a systemic recognition process from various tribes in arizona california nevada north carolina oklahoma michigan washington oregon idaho montana california minnesota new mexico what i am saying to you is that the american indian has an established process for tribal recognition they want to keep this orderly process and not return to a political logrolling process do the lumbees deserve federal recognition i cannot answer that question and congress should not determine it if we do this what do we do with the numerous other groups across this nation who want to be recognized do we immediately put bills before this body to consider these groups and what about those groups who were turned down through the fap process can we say that those who were turned down should not be allowed to come back through the legislative process and if they can find a legislator here with enough power that they become federally recognized as a tribe of american indians let me emphasize that what the american indians and certainly the cherokee in my district have expressed eloquently to me is that they do not object and question this bill based on whether or not there will be a financial loss to one tribe versus another tribe they are not considering this from a monetary standpoint we appropriate precious little now to support the tribes of this country the tribes that i have met with have expressed to me their concern that we will dilute a very sacred recognition process and they consider it most serious they feel it will return tribal recognition to a political process that will depend more on political power rather than true

think probably 17 or 18 i do not remember exactly that were brought before the rules committee many of those amendments were strictly there for one purpose and that was they were dilatory they were there to try to weaken the bill to inflame one segment of the population as opposed to the other not all but a large number of them were there were three i think substantial amendments that the house

crime bill before this body today that we are not dealing with assault weapons that we are not dealing withcriminals who take 10 or 15 years for their sentences to be executed that we cannot deal with habeas corpus we had a bill that passed this house last year that said that if you are on death row you have one appeal and it must be done by a qualified lawyer and it must be done within a year we could not get it through the senate the reason these people stay on death row for as long as they do is because there are a lot of jailhouse lawyers other inmates that go to the law library and figure out how to file petitions we put an end to all this and i think that should be before the house i think a comprehensive crime bill should be before the house america is bleeding on its streets and let me say and it was mentioned it is not just washington dc it is not just los angeles ca it is not just new york city where all of this is happening i can remember in my part of the country years ago we thought the drug problem was confined to the major metropolitan area of this country but we soon learned much to our horror that the drug problem was not a problem of the large metropolitan areas only it was a problem of the small communities and bylaws throughout this country and we are going to find out and are finding out that guns are murdering our citizens handguns are murdering our citizens

direction to keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and keeping guns out of the hands of the criminally insane we are going to look back all of us one of these days and will never be able to

to me that there are three options that we canaddress we said then in the context of south africa that there were three options available to us i would suggest in the context of haiti there are three options available to us we can step aside and do nothing that is unacceptable we can talk about the use of force and the invasion of haiti i came here 24 years ago as an advocate of peace i have stood in the well over and over and over again saying that peace is a better idea and diplomacy and political solutions toproblemsare a better idea so i take the use of force off the table which comes then to the third option how do we within the context of the powers that we have available to us stand up in defense ofhuman rights and democratic principles in the context of haiti this issue has been on the back burner for too long the gentleman from new york is absolutely correct this is not the fashion in which this amendment ought to come the committee on foreign affairs ought to bring a bill to the floor of congress to address this we introduced such a bill and had over 100 cosponsors there should be hearings there should be a process by which these matters are dealt with but we all

this moment we now have an opportunity to talk the death and destruction that is taking place in haiti is an abomination and we need to stand up unequivocally and oppose it the drugs that are being trafficked through this situation that have impacted upon our nation are something that we need to address the refugees that are coming toward this country is an example of the deplorable set of circumstances that exist in haiti that must be addressed the issue in haiti the message we ought to be sending around the world and certainly in this region is what is more powerful the bullet or the ballot in the context of haiti the haitian people said the ballot is more powerful than the bullet and if we truly believe that then we must stand in unequivocal opposition to what is happening in haiti i applaud the international efforts that have been taken by this administration but i believe that this administration also on a unilateral basis has an opportunity to impose sanctions and bring stringent pressure on the people in haiti that are denying these human beings their human rights their human dignity their human freedom and their democratic principles remember nelson mandela just raised his hand as the president of a great nation in some part because of what this nation did unilaterally as we stood up in the world community and took a position and said that we must stand in defense of democratic principles can we do less with respect to haiti can we do less in this region we should be buoyed by the experiences of south africa we should be inspired by the installment of nelson mandela in south africa to give us a feeling that we do have a role to play make a significant contribution in elevating the international conscience with respect to this issue i would not have liked to see this amendment come to the floor in this fashion i always believe there ought to be hearings and discussions and debate and deliberation but the fact of the matter is that there is great frustration in these chambers and so we end up in this place the one gentleman has offered an amendment we offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute but at least it takes the issue off the back burner puts it on the front burner of america and allows us to discuss this issue in some clear and unequivocal terms the message that we must send to the elite and the powerful in the military in haiti is that as a great nation we cannot sit by idly and allow these things to happen the world is marching toward a more rational reality the world is marching toward some greater reality some greater commitment to human rights when israelis and palestinians can cross eons of time to shake hands to march forward into the future when nelson mendela and afrikaners can shake hands to march into the future then it is very clear that the world is on a different path we have to be on the right side of history i am concerned that we are not bringing the most stringent pressure that we can on haiti question does sanction create greater dislocation and bring pain to people in haiti the answer is yes but it can be temporary at this point the pain and the oppression are permanent the death and destruction is real on a daily basis my hope is that this separate strategy nonviolent though it be a rejection of force though it be i will stand proudly and clearly saying that i think that there is a nonviolent mechanism that we can use we have always argued in these chambers that before we talk about the use of force that we should be willing to exhaust all nonviolent means to bring pressure to achieve our commitment to democratic principles and to a commitment to human rights well we are not there yet we are not bringing the awesome necessary pressure to bear that we in this

turkey this is probably one of the most tragic incidents of the 20th century april 24 1915 marks the beginning of the massacres on this day hundreds of armenian leaders were exiled and murdered shortly after this thousands of armenians were deported from their homeland and placed in turdsh and kurdish homes and harems they were sent on marches through the syrian desert where they were severely mistreated surviving refugees escaped to different countries which separated families and scattered them all over the globe some would want to forget this tragedy it would be much easier to bury it in the past we cannot ignore what the armenians went through this part of history needs to be remembered with profound sorrow and horror at such a shocking example of the brutality of man on this 78th anniversary of the armenian genocide i wish to join in with the armenian people in a day of remembrance on this day let us think of those people who needlessly lost their lives this incident should serve to remind each of us of the tragic consequences that can result when ethnic racial or religious intolerance spreads unchecked as events in the world unfold particularly in bosnia let us

legislation reforming the general mining law i would have reservations about how to vote and so would others as my colleagues know the senate passed a mining law reform bill in the dead of night last spring justified as a ticket to conference so today the house considers its ticket to conference america does need mining reform this nation is a far different place from 1872 and the rules of that law in which the right to mine is secured if it can be done at a profit are inappropriate in todays world i want to thank the chairmen of the subcommittee and of the full committee for working with those of us from the west who support mining reform but who had great concern abut the rahall bills provisions which would have unnecessarily impeded mining from going forward on public lands the rahall bill would have required a nationwide study of lands as to their suitability for mining and would have imposed such broad criteria that the only thing certain was that unsuitability decisions would have been tied up in the agencies and then in the courts for decades the chairman of the subcommittee worked with those of us who believe on one hand that we should provide the agencies with authority to decide that some federal lands are so environmentally critical that they are unsuitable for mining and on the other hand that the provisions need to be crafted very thoughtfully and with full protection for existing projects or those well into the planning stages the rahall bill would have treated exploration for minerals in the same way that it treated the actual mining of minerals again the chairmen worked with me and others in providing a eparate track entirely for the forest service and blm to consider mineral exploration activities we have uow protected the traditional practice of allowing small miners and explorationists to go on to the public lands and do the same kinds of exploration work they do today under the same procedures they use today and the two chairmen worked with us most recently to resolve what had become the mining industrys most important concern that being the rules of transition in which existing mines and those in the planning process must come under the new system the bill provides for an orderly transition process which will threaten no project which today has a formal relationship with the federal government i have remaining disagreements with the bill and i hope that these are addressed in conference the 8 percent royalty should be reworked and its clear that it will be in conference clearly the american people should be paid for a resource they own the difficulty is to determine both a fair price and a price that doesnt force mines to close and put people out of work the bill does not in my judgment go far enough to protect the small miner the folks who have used their own ingenuity and resourcefulness to go out and do the enormous amount of work it takes to develop a small mine there are hundreds of these small operators in montana they dont have lobbyists and what they think of this bill quite frankly is unprintable i have an amendment which i may offer to give these folks a break from the bills requirement that they pay the full cost of the agencys expenses to process a permit in conclusion madam chairman there is some good work being done here today revenues we receive from the royalty and holding fees will go100 percentto the reclamation of abandoned mines my state has several hundred abandoned mines yet there is no program no source of funds to beginthe cleanup necessary to recover these sites for the first time we will have minimum federal land mining and reclamation standards assuring a basic level of protection for federal lands regardless of the policies of one state or another and for the first time we will have in place federal authority to decide that in some places of significant importance because of their special natural resources mining is simply not appropriate there are many places where mining is appropriate mining is a critical american industry metals are an important national resource let us get on with this reform by passing a bill to conference so we can find

president will make both the president and the congress more accountable to the american people the substitute proposed by jerry solomon peter blute jack quinn and myself is the best method to make our government more accountable for its spending decisions the castlesolomon substitute is the lineitem veto as a former governor i can tell you from experience that a lineitem veto by itself will not end the deficit it will not balance the budget it is not a magic solution to our budget problems however it is an effective method to improve how we spend the taxpayers money by making both the president and congress more accountable for their spending decisions we will produce better legislation with less wasteful spending accountability is the key if the president has the lineitem veto he cannot shirk his responsibility for funding programs that are unnecessary he will not be able to blame socalled pork barrel spending on congress if he does not agree with a specific appropriation he can cross it out and demand that congress justify the spending by disapproving his veto accountability the lineitem veto will make congress more accountable to the american people with the lineitem veto in place congress will take a harder look at the programs it funds congress will not be able to send an appropriations bill to the president that includes projects which do not stand up to scrutiny to my colleagues who fear that the lineitem veto will give the executive branch of our government too much power at the expense of the legislative branch this will not occur rather experienceshows us that the existence of the veto simply encourages the executive and the legislature to negotiate reasonable responsible legislation which does not fund pork barrel projects today the true lineitem veto is contained in the castlesolomon amendment this amendment would authorize the president to rescind or cut any discretionary appropriation for the next 2 years these cuts would go into effect unless both houses of congress voted against the spending cuts this is the crux of the matter congress should have to vote to disapprove the presidents cuts the sprattstenholm bill allows either house to derail the cuts simply by not passing legislation to approve them to be honest this wiggle room will allow congress to avoid confronting the tough decisions the american people want them to make on spending the castle solomon amendment is a true lineitem veto it would require both houses of congress to disapprove the presidents cuts the president could then veto the disapproval bill and his veto would have to be overridden by a twothirds vote in both houses if this fails the cuts go into effect a true lineitem veto will not tilt the balance of power in the federal government
