ceasefire i cannot answer all the allegations the gentleman made regarding the misuse of funds by the freedom fighters but what i would like to say is that many of us believe strongly that the reason that the communists came to the conference table was not because of their good will but because they made the incursion into honduras and they thought that might have switched some votes in the unitedstates congress which would lead to additional contras military support from this body for that reason alone they wanted to stop that military assistance from getting there so they sat down at the conference table and said lets have a truce that truce is leading to the result that we see here today humanitarian aid without any military assistance to the contras so they are getting in essence what they were after in my view i support this bill today because it is going to give humanitarian aid to starving freedom fighters who have laid their lives on the line it is going to help their families so from that standpoint i support it however this vote will not end the conflict in central america until the communists in nicaragua are removed from power there will be conflict there will be war it may stop from time to time when they feel threatened by the united states in some way that is direct military aid to the contras or maybe the threat of unitedstates military involvement but the conflict will then continue why because they want the revolution to spread into all the countries in central america and south america they said this to us they have told us all this time and

have in hungary and yugoslavia and other communist countries but they do not have freedom remember this and we want to say it again and again regarding central america peace without freedom is not

approved similar resolutions for the past 6 years to recognize the valuable services of home care programs and personnel and i look forward to congressional passage once again as you all know thousands of home care agencies around the nation have responded to the need to offer effective alternatives to our health care delivery system by providing skilled medical assistance to those who can be properly treated outside the hospital or nursing home setting these agencies recognize the demand for new health care options and conserve tax dollars currently expended on needless placement in these institutions this valuable concept of care provides a serviceable answer to the needs of our health care system and offers a comforting dignified environment for patients alternatives to our health care programs must be offered and home care agencies have proven very effective in answering that need as you know one of the most critical issues to face our nation today centers around our health care system while the growing elderly population expected to total well over 30 million by the year 2000 places greater demand on our current system home care agencies have helped many of the elderly remain at home and in their communities this creates an atmosphere of greater independence and dignity and promotes an easeful recovery for this service home care agencies and persons employed

legisation which was passed by the house on septembor 7 these aviationrelated provisions have strong support on both side of the aisle and are noncontroversial over the past year the committee on public works and transportation has conducted an indepth investigation into what the federal aviation administration could do to better assist the drug interdiction and enforcement efforts of local

aircraft more difficult it is also clear that there is need to improve the faas information of pilots and aircraft ownership to facilitate investigations of and legal actions against drug smugglers when drug enforcement authorities learn that a particular aircraft is being used in drug smuggling activities it is sometimes difficult or impossible to discover the identity of the true owners the difficulty is cause by the ease with which the faas aircraft registration and pilot certification requirements can be circumvented by smugglers in addition there are some significant holes in the faas system of registering aircraft and pilots even when a pilot or owner is acting in good faith the faas registration system is adequate to its purposes of recording liens on aircraft however it is not well suited to assisting in drug interdiction and enforcement h r 4844 directs the faa to initiate a rulemaking to reform the registration of aircraft and pilots so that the records on pilots and

before we come across with these types of photographs suggesting that the contras have gone out and somehow systematically killed folks that we ought to be very careful because the truth of the matter is that it is impossible to engage in any type of war without there being innocent victims can my colleagues imagine for a moment what would have happened if just after world war ii or worse yet during world war il unitedstates news correspondents had shown on the evening news or just in the newsreels in the various movie theaters the bodies of individuals that were victims of our bombing germany and other places during world war ii we know for a fact that individuals when there is a war are going to be casualties but what bothers me is the suggestion that somehow these individuals were not in the areas for example one of the photographs this morning was from an airstrip an individual in a military target was killed i would have to say that when an individual goes into a known combat zone they certainly assume the risks i am just troubled by the fact that we are somehow separating these photographs and the suggestion of these photographs from the reality of what is going on in central america if my colleagues go back to the american revolution they will find that there were undoubtedly americans that were killed as part of a war war means that it is regrettable but the point here is there is war in central america not because of american intervention because let us remember under the carter administration we pumped over 100 million into the sandinista government before we learned that they were avowed communists at that time i think that they were the equivalent in terms of our policy with the philippines today we are doing exactly the same thing there has been a successful revolution we aided those individuals in their revolution and now we are seeking to help them establish a legitimate democracy we did exactly the same thing and it was not until the soviet union through their puppets whether it is the east germans or the cubans began the massive military buildup that caused even president carter to withdraw further aid and our president our current president to say we are not going to not only aid them any further we are going to try to help these individuals many of whom were original sandinistas who wanted a revolution who wanted to have free elections who wanted to have a free press who wanted to have freedom of religion all of whom quickly saw through daniel ortega and his communist friends and they left the ruling junta they left the communist government and they established the contras so the contras exist not because of american interventionalism in a military fashion but because of soviet interventionalism just as

section 5 of the house passed bill h r 2642 the two tribes are voluntarily converting their water right to a state water right if they choose to use it off reservation the resolution guarantees that the tribes may continue to hold their water rights on their reservations subject to the terms of the agreement the amendment was offered in order to alleviate the concerns of other tribes that section 5 c 1 of h r 2642 might somehow subject indian reserved water rights to the principles of abandoment and forteiture contained in state law put more simply this resolution is consistent with the intent of h r 2642 the indians water rights only become state water rights when used off reservation and only if the tribes elect to use the water off reservation the resolution also ensures that h r 2642 is not viewed as a precedent for future settlement or judicial decisions involving the issue of offreservation leasing of indian reserved water rights this has been accomplished by elaborating on the exi

title i and title ii authorizing funding for health programs that are exclusively within this committees jurisdiction the substitute before the house authorizes two health initiatives for the homeless

and human services would make grants to public or private nonprofit organizations to deliver outpatient health care services for the homeless the services covered would include outpatient mental health services outpatient substance abuse services and case management services the precise mix of services would depend on the needs of the homeless population in each community to assure that limited federal funds are targeted on those communities that are most committed to meeting the health needs of the homeless grantees would be required to come up with nonfederal funds or inkind contributlons of 25 percent of the cost of operating the project the secretary would waive this local matching requirement but only in certain limited circumstances this program is modeled on a successful private sector initiative now underway in 18 cities throughout the country funded at 25 million by the robert wood johnson foundation and the pew memorial trust this program has demonstrated how health care services can be delivered to the homeless a population that is completely uninsured unpopular with providers and notoriously difficult to reach the second committee initiative relates to the community support program run by the national institute of mental health the csp program which is currently appropriated at 15 million provides communitybased service to chronically mentally ill adults and children the committee initiative would authorize an additional 25 million for this program in fiscal year 1987 for project grants to states localities or private nonprofit agencies for the delivery of community mental health services to the chronically mentally ill who are homeless the services that could be made available under this authority include outreach case management and assistance with residential programs let me highlight a few basic points about these two initiatives first these programs can be implemented in a short period of time if appropriations are made available soon qualified programs can be operating throughout the country by the end of this year second the benefits of these programs are targeted on the homeless which the bill defines as individuals who lack housing third funding under these programs could go to rural as well as urban areas the committee recognizes that homelessness is not just an urban problem so long as an applicant is qualified and meets the local matching requirement the secretary is authorized to make grants to both rural and urban areas finally the committee has insisted on reporting

the states through block grants including the alcohol drug abuse and mental health block grant however the plain fact is that these programs are not reaching the homeless and many of the homeless are not getting needed care to reach the homeless you have to go where they areon the streets in the shelters in the soup kitchens you have to be prepared to offer a number of different servicesprimary

mean let me also say that incest is a form of rape only it is within the family let me say also abortion does not cure that familys situation something more has to be done to get the poor victim of the incest away from the perpetrator of the incest and abortion does not go to that at all but i think to understand fully this soulwrenching issue let us focus for a moment away from the woman just for a moment and look at the other victim the unborn child and let us try to figure out what an abortion does to that child now it is not a tonsillectomy it is not an appendectomy by definition by

you a picture a little newborn baby that you are holding in your arms think of that when you vote on this issue and ask yourself if you can be an accessory to exterminating that little child because his father committed a crime that is as real a picture for you to form in your mind as anything else it is a matter of focus of emphasis i ask you to extend your compassion to that abstraction that you cannot see you cannot touch it because it is in the mothers womb that tiny child of transcendent human value surrounded by a woman who has been victimized but who indeed is a mother in the fullest sense of the term this is a human rights issue and you have in all of these situations conflicting rights conflicting rights you have the right of the first victim to have her body free from the consequences of a criminal act of rape that is over here and over here you have the very right to life itself the right to live of the second victim the unborn now when rape and incest occur a great injustice occurs an enormous monstrous inhumane humiliating brutal injustice occurs in all honesty i cannot say other than that forcing a woman to carry to term the child of the rapist is anything but a terrible injustice but that having been said must we visit another injustice on top of that must we superimpose that on this crime of rape by destroying in the womb an innocent preborn child it is not a tumor it is not a bad tooth or swollen tonsils that little microscopic entity is a tiny member of the human family that has committed no treason has committed no crime and we must perform an act of virtue some act of will to transfer due process and the equal protection of the law to the second victim because that is the second victim but it is a far greater injustice to kill the child superimposing that injustice on the injustice of the rape we cannot avoid injustice in a rape situation we cannot avoid injustice in an incest situation we can ameliorate we can mitigate we can help we can nurture we can alleylate but we cannot escape injustice but why must we compound the injustice by adding to it the extermination of an innocent human life one that cannot rise up on the street cannot speak out cannot defend himself or herself and cannot escape the injustice of rape lasts at least nine months it is a terrible injustice but it can be helped psychologically financially and

double tragedy of rape and exterminating an unborn child there are very very few such pregnancies in this country we cannot get the statistics there are studies i can quote for the members that say it almost never happens but i must suggest to members that we should let planned parenthood pay for those who insist on punishing the child for the crime of the father why must the federal government supply the only answer and be an accessory in the extermination of an innocent life these are poor women yes but there are poor babies they are defenseless defenseless babies ethel waters was a great black actress who passed away a few years ago she played a famous role in cabin in the sky i do not know whether many remember it perhaps only i do but perhaps some who are a little older will

abstract this little atom of humanity defenseless and innocent and let us know that while rape is a terrible thing an abortion is worse because rape with all of its horror is not killing where there is life surely there is hope but abortion terminates a life and one of those little lives might have found the secret to cancer to multiple sclerosis to world peace one of those little lives that is now thrown out like a crushed empty beer can it is a tough vote but i plead with the members to support the gentleman from kentucky and support the gentleman from massachusetts who have been like

of certain amendments added by the other body to the fair housing amendments act of 1988 my colleagues will recall that the house considered the fair housing legislation on june 22 and june 23 and finally approved the legislation on june 29 subsequently when the housepassed bill went to the other body a series of negotiations ensued to resolve the remaining differences between the civil rights community and the administration our purpose here today is to consider and hopefully accept the changes to h r 1158 adopted by the senate it should be pointed out that these changes have the support of the unitedstates department of housing and urban development the department of justice as well as key elements in the business community principally the national association of realtors and the national association of home builders the amendments adopted in the other body do no harm to the spirit of the balanced compromise approved by this house just a few weeks ago in fact many of these amendments serve to enhance and reinforce some of the provisions contained in that compromise for example many members of this house were concerned about the potential adverse impact that the coverage of families with children could have on senior citizens retirement communities under the language of one notable senate amendment existing senior citizen communities will have increased flexibility and possibility to qualify for the exemption from the familial status requirements just as important is the senateadded language providing a transition period for the current residents of housing that excludes children they will not be required to leave that housing nor will they be subject to eviction that is existing residents whose presence in a community or apartment complex might otherwise cause the community to fall outside the protections in section 807 b 2 will not be counted in calculating whether the exemption should apply the bottom line is that senior citizens retirement communities across the united states will have a greater chance of qualifying for the housing for older persons exemption furthermore no one will be evicted whether in a senior citizens community or an alladult community because of the enactment of this bill litigation authority was also an issue when we considered h r 1158 on this floor approximately 6 weeks ago the language contained in the bill before the house today fully consolidates in the department of justice the authority to represent the federal government in all of the enforcement actions under the fair housing act however while the litigation will be conducted by lawyers from the department of justice the decision as to whether or not prompt judicial action is necessary to obtain injunctive relief or to seek court enforcement of a finding of discriminatirn will still be lodged with the secretary of housing and urban development so under the latest compromise the secretary will decide whether or not litigation should occur where the secretary authorizes the litigation it is transmitted to the attorney general and lie is required to promptly commence and maintain such action consistent with the terms of the senate amendment the amended version of h r 1158 also contains a technical amendment to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies making it clear that certain interim certifications by hud are included in the bill the language adopted in the other body also makes it clear that this legislation is not requiring the establishment of a federal building code because of the accessibility and adaptability requirement for newly constructed multifamlly dwellings these and the other changes made in h r 1158 are improvements and refinements fully consistent with the spirit of the housepassed compromise bill we are in the final stretch run of a circuitous race that began nearly 10 years ago this bipartisan effortto strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1968 law and expand the coverage of the fair housing protections under title viii of the civil rights acthas tested the stamina of many of us in this house my good friend and distinguished colleague from california civil and constitutional rights subcommittee chairman don edwards in particular is to be commended for his patience determination and effective leadership in this effort we are on the threshold of finally passing a federal fair housing law that is workable and effective thirtysix million disabled persons will receive the protections of this fundamental civil rights statute families with children will no longer be arbitrarily limited in their choice of decent housing the secretary of hud will have new and significant powers to investigate discrimination complaints and to enforce the rights guaranteed under this statute if discrimination is found and proven state and local fair housing agencies will contintic their vital integral role in fair housing enforcement all across the united states the states and localities are given an adequate grace period to bring their statutes and ordinances in line with the new federal law so that they can continue to handle a majority of these fair housing complaints complainants and respondents in fair housing discrimination cases are guaranteed due process rights in administrative proceedings and the fundamental right to a trial by jury in a unitedstates district court in instances where they so elect either the adjudication or the trial that results from the election is intended to be a final decision concerning the claims raised by the aggrieved person or any intervenor the aggrieved person or any intervenor may not relitigate the same claims raised in the complaint or seek additional or alternative relief through a direct action in federal court as was reflected in the colloquy between the gentleman from california and myself during consideration of this legislation in june res judicata applies and the intent is that claims based upon the same set of facts should be consolidated into one case before concluding i want to take this one last opportunity

deserves acknowledgment and acclaim for his many contributions in addition i also want to give muchdeserved credit to our former colleague and friend from the other body the distinguished senator from maryland charles mcc mathias for many years mac was the principal sponsor of this legislation in the senate and was always ready and willing to lend his time and his advice to this effort pivotal

naacp kerry scanlon of the washington lawyers committee for civil rights under law wade henderson of the aclu and penda hair of the naacp legal defense fund also brought their usual fairness and balance to this effort the compromise that brought about prompt approval of this legislation in the house of representatives just a few weeks ago could never have occurred without the assistance of these and other representatives of the civil rights community their willingness to compromise was the key this is also an appropriate time to give recognition to many of the unsung heroes which you

texas new jersey and maine and the beaches of the west coast as well there were few surprises in what we found as we collected the refuse of our own beaches for the most part though we came up with

who came to enjoy our beaches this summer the people who did bring their suntan lotion and their towels and their blankets but i know that a great deal of what we found last saturday and a great deal of what others will find on their beaches this fall are items that were simply tossed overboard from ships in the atlantic ocean or the pacific ocean or the gulf of mexico twenty years ago i was a

did sink and perhaps most of it never did show its face again and never posed a problem to any of us today much of the refuse that is dumped by naval vessels and much of the refuse that is dumped by merchant ships and much of the refuse that is dumped by fli hing vessels is plastic it floats and we are going to see it again we saw it again last satuday and we will see it again next saturday and in the saturdays ahead as our volunteers found out last saturday much of this stuff floats it does not degrade it is with us for a long long time the time has come though to put a stop to this

rationale first we were told that it was vital to protect the interest of our allies but in venice when our allies were asked they saw no interest to protect and no policy to support then we were told it was because of american oil dependence only to discover that 6 percent of american oil comes from the gulf and that kuwait provides only 15 percent of all oil in the region and that indeed most of the oil is flowing over land and only iran has an exclusive dependency for exporting through the gulf then we were told that it was the sanctity of freedom of the seas indeed but the only ships we are protecting are kuwati not international shipping not even ships owned by american companies bringing oil to america under foreign flags there is no issue of sanctity of international shipping fourth we were told that it was the interest of our friends in the gulf our friends who have denied access for american air cover to defend our own naval vessels then finally it was the question of the soviet union this is the question that when the presidents chiefs of staff were asked they thought perhaps it was a good thing this is the soviet presence that has now been offered to be withdrawn the soviet presence which consists of three mine sweepers this now is the final the last gasping rationale of an american policy i know that members feel a responsibility to support the president we have one but we have other responsibilities too we have a responsibility that before america acts we act together there are deep divisions in this house and indeed in this country and who would contend

several points the first point is that in the instance the gentleman has suggested he is correct that the court made the determination that there was an unconstitutional deprivation of rights in his particular case that is not the history of this incident the incident was challenged in the courts all the way to the supreme court and it was the judgment of the supreme court at that time that franklin delano roosevelt was within his constitutional powers as commander in chief to issue this order and to have it implemented so in fact there was not a violation of constitutional rights as understood at that time the gentleman knows the argument now with respect to mr bork in the other body is whether the constitution is a continuing evolving document members of his side of the aisle generally accept that argument at the time of the acts in question here it has evolved to such a point that in fact the president of the united states was within his constitutional rights and therefore the constitutional rights of the individuals involved were not violated what we are doing now is looking back 45 years later one of the reasons we have economic recompense in a case like that of the gentleman from california is not because there was a financial calculation that it was worth 7 500 for each person to be denied the amount of time they were to be given to consult with the gentleman on the steps of the capitol but in essence because that was considered a serious enough financial burden on the government to be a deterrent to that conduct in the future and there was a close connection between the violation of civil rights perpetrated by the government and the penalty placed on the government so that those in power or those they represented were immediately punished that is very different from what we are talking about now we are talking about an action that was reviewed by the supreme court 45 years ago and determined to be constitutional at that point now we are coming in 45 years later and saying despite the fact that it was constitutional at that time in retrospect we think it was wrongincidentally i agree it was wrongand therefore we are going to give recompense if we read the committees own language they say the reasoning for it is deterrence i find that faulty reasoning we are not going to deter somebody from action now by saying 45 years from now that other people unelected maybe not even alive at this time are going to suffer the consequences of the decisions we make so i think these are very very different circumstances what i am saying is as we correct the historical record as we make it abundantly clear that there was not disloyalty visited upon this country by any japaneseamerican or any japanese national here as we make abundantly clear that any shadow of a doubt ought to be lifted as we try to take the lessons out of that that is the important thing we ought to be doing rather than by saying that the only way to judge the sincerity of our action is by the amount of money behind the dollar signs given to the individuals involved so i understand the gentlemans point i think his point is absolutely relevant to his experience i have tried to point out the vast difference between his experience and the experience we are judging now"], [0.0018634796142578125, 0.5018634796142578, 0, "i thank the gentleman for his comments today we are going to be facing these two amendments that are going to be brought up and i can say that the bipartisan delegation that went to the persian gulf area signed a statement

not the policy for us to take because our president has declared that policy they are still having some problems with the approach we have taken as i do but we are declaring our support for the position of this country and the response that has been received by the leaders of those persian gulf states and the negative reaction that would occur if we backed down on that commitment but the second amendment that is going to be offered is the lowry amendment and my problem is that in my opinion the vote on the lowry amendment today is going to be a cya vote it is going to be a vote by the membership of this body as to whether or not they will cover their rear ends on the issue of reflagging i say to my colleagues if you are totally opposed to reflagging stand up and be counted and vote for the bennett amendment but i say if you are not opposed to reflagging if you think the president of this country sets the policy and that we need to work with him and improve those areas that are weak then there is an alternative and i agree that there are some weak areas in terms of european involvement in terms of gcc commitment and some of the other strategic things we have to look at and in terms of our u n resolution support of which i am fully supportive and will push the administration to more aggressively support than it has been with the nonaligned nations so what i say is that

and we are going to sneak out of this chamber by voting for the lowry amendment when we know it is not going to take effect because we know we are not going to get the twothirds vote required in the house and the senate to make that become law it is a charade on the american people i do not think it is the proper course to take i think we as americans have to stand up as leaders even though it might not be the most popular position in this instance and support our president i urge a vote against both the bennett amendment and the lowry amendment"], [0.0019218623638153076,

of genocide are too great to be held in peoples memories for too long we need constant reminders of what humankind has been capable of in order to ensure that the world will never see an attempt to exterminate an entire people this day provides us an opportunity to remember prior to 1914 there were over 2 million armenians living in turkey since the end of the first world war there have never been more than approximately 100 000 this is a truly staggering fact that a population could be reduced to 5 percent of its original size in the space of a few short years is almost incomprehensible the 20th century has seen horrors previously unknown and unimagined by human beings the final solution in hitlers germany the firebombing of dresden by the allies during world war ii which left that historic city looking like the surface of the moon in cambodia we still see the horrors of pol pots regime weapons have been developed and used which have destructive power that is almost beyond understanding all of these horrors have been acknowledged by the world community and all have been subjected to the shame of universal denunciation yet before any of these terrible events occurred the armenian population of turkey was reduced to onetwentieth its previous size the world community has been strangely silent on the methods through which this happened in 1908 there was a revolution in the ottoman empire and the group which would come to be known as the young turks rose to power the young turks endorsed a policy of turkish supremacy and attempted to assimilate all the various nationalities within the ottoman empire into one huge turkish people the armenian people had preserved their cultural integrity for centuries they had a tremendous sense of themselves and pride in their history needless to say they would not allow their rich cultural heritage to be stripped away armenians resisted conscription into the ottoman armies and in some cases formed armed resistance groups these groups gave the young turks the excuse they needed to systematically slaughter an entire people the turkish government began wholesale deportation and murder of armenians claiming it was necessary for reasons of national security united states ambassador morgenthau in turkey and witnessing these activities wrote that the treatment given the convoys clearly shows that extermination was the real purpose the turkish government claims that the armenian genocide is a fabrication cleverly created by the armenian insurgents i find this hard to believe the armenian genocide happened millions of people were killed in a deliberate attempt to eliminate an entire culture the united states and the rest of the world cannot must not continue to deny history the armenian people resisted the efforts to crush them and their courage and strength in the face of tremendous adversity should be praised it has been 80 years since the young turks came to power how much longer will the world wait to acknowledge the tragedy that befell the armenian people genocide is a crime against humanity that is unrivaled by any other when we next hear the plaintive cry never againt let us think of all peoples who have been crushed under the iron hand of an oppressor and had the strength and the will to resist and rise another day"], [0.002074122428894043, 0.502074122428894, 1, "house resolution 175 waives all points of order against the education and labor committees amendment in the nature of a substitute for h r 1451the older americans amendments of 1987for failure to comply with section 303 a 4 of the congressional budget act as my colleagues are aware the house adopted house resolution 171 yesterday which provided for the consideration of h r 1451 because of an oversight the rules committee was unaware when it reported the first rule that the substitute was in violation of the budget act section 303 a 4 of the budget act prohibits the consideration of any measure that would provide new entitlement authority that is to take effect in a fiscal year for which a concurrent resolution on the budget has not been adopted by congress section 42 of the substitute as it was reported from the committee on education and labor would make senior day care centers eligible to receive the same benefits that are received by child day care centers under the school lunch act since the provision creates a new entitlement to these federal benefits that first takes effect on october 1 1987 and since a concurrent resolution on the budget has not yet been adopted for fiscal year 1988 this provision renders the education and labor committee substitute in violation of the budget act and the waiver is required in order for the committees work to be considered i urge my colleagues to adopt house resolution 175 so that we may consider the education and labor committees recommendation with respect to this important bill"], [0.00251924991607666, 0.49748075008392334, 0, "i take this time to instruct conferees relating to a matter that has become perhaps the no 1 issue in america at least certainly in the area of public health namely the aids epidemic it is a major public health issue of immense dimensions when anyone in the political process in the public health world or in a conference or in a state legislature begins to talk about taking certain steps in the public health world to control the epidemic inevitably one comes into contact with the group that has contributed 73 percent of the aids cases in america male homosexuals we cannot avoid it it is a public health issue but as i say when steps that we should be taking but are not taking to control this disease are not being pursued in the public health world that are advocated by this member from california such as reportability and testing the people who contribute the largest percentage of the cases in america object claiming and this is the essence of the debate that the civil rights of those that are involved with the disease in their view takes precedence over the public health of the rest of us who choose not to acquire the disease because whether we like it or not we are talking about homosexuality in our society i think it is appropriate for us to examine and find out a little bit about how extensive the movement of homosexuality in america has become in terms of changing the cultural values of our society so that we will accept and equate homosexuality on a par with heterosexual lifestyle that is why this member from california is offering this motion to instruct conferees on this hhs appropriations bill very simply it says that none of the money that is appropriated to cdc in atlanta ga the centers for disease control can be used directly or indirectly for propagating or expanding directly or indirectly the homosexual lifestyle when any of us makes such a claim or a motion immediately the question properly arises congressman what evidence do you have that there is any necessity for this kind of a motion at all is your justification for making this motion merely hypotheses that it might happen or do you have any empirical evidence that federal funds are now being used to propagandize and expand the homosexual lifestyle in the event that there may be some in this chamber who think that this evidence does not exist please disabuse yourself of that notion because i have it right here a publication of a group in new york city called the gay mens health crisis which in the last 2 years has received two grants totaling 674 679 from cdc in atlanta for conducting their operations i would like to share with my colleagues how this member got involved in this particular aspect of the issue a good friend of mine now living in texas called the unitedstates public health service hotline maintained here in washington dc an 800 number and he received a recorded message at the end of the recorded message a counsellor came on the telephone and advised this caller that if more information was desired they could call the american social health association in new york and gave him a phone number and an address my friend called this number that was given to him for the american social health association in new york and talked with a person at that office at the conclusion of that conversation the operator at that office in new york referred my caller my friend to an outfit in new york city called the gay mens health crisis my friend called this gay mens health crisis on the telephone and explained that he wanted some information that could be useful for teenagers in order to instruct them as to how they could avoid getting aids in response to that request for that kind of information this material was mailed out from the gay mens health crisis in new york city it consists of probably 25 pages in comic book form and i can share with my colleagues that the pictures in this text have 2 men engaged in any physical contact involving the sex orgms that the mind of man can conjure in a nutshell as one supreme court justice said i cant define pornography very well but i know it when i see it what was mailed out from this gay mens health crisis center in new york city that received 674 000 of the unitedstates government in the last 2 years can only be charitably described as pornographic clearly trash if the american taxpayer was familiar with what is coming out of this gay mens health crisis they would be on the telephone to all of us immediately saying do what you have to do but cut out this nonsense it is not the function of the unitedstates taxpayer or the unitedstates government to directly or indirectly advance or encourage the homosexual lifestyle we live in a pluralistic america and people if they choose to pursue the homosexual lifestyle i conceded have the right to do that but i submit to my colleagues they do not have the right to advance that lifestyle by applying to an agency of the unitedstates government and getting federal funds and then put out trash like this when a caller calls in and says they want information for teenagers as to how teenagers can avoid getting aids so that is what this motion does i would hope that my colleagues would see fit to vote aye in favor of this motion to instruct conferees because i believe it is the only rational course that our body should pursue"]]}
