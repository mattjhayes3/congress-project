national forests the exchange involves approximately 1 200 acres of forest serviceland for approximately 1 100 acres of georgia power land the exchange will allow the forest service to acquire one of two remaining nonfederal properties within congressionally designated wilderness areas in north georgia this tract is in the middle of the rich mountain wilderness and totally surrounded by other national forest lands the vast majority of lands to be transferred by the forest service lie at the bottom of lake oconee and are not actively conveying any public benefit the remainder of the properties being relinquished to georgia power is currently occupied by georgia power facilities in rabun county these properties are of minimal value to the national forest and would be more appropriately owned by georgia power the forest service as detailed by the forest supervisors decision memo has determined that the transfer complies with the national environmental policy act of 1969 and is supportive of the bill in addition 67 percent of the lands of rabun county are currently part of the chattahoochee national forest this concentrated ownership poses a considerable strain on the ad valorem tax base of rabun county included within the land exchange is the conveyance to georgia power company of over 145 acres of property in rabun county that currently houses georgia power

the gentleman from minnesota and the ranking member the gentleman from pennsylvania for their excellent work as a first term member of this committee i am impressed with the efficiency and the bipartisan cooperation and the outstanding staff i want to thank the members for considering and authorizing on a contingent basis the antelope creek project for the fourstate missouri river mitigation project and particularly for helping the taxpayer by the coordination of flood control and highway construction related to the sand creek reservoir it is an outstanding opportunity to coordinate this it was timeurgent and therefore very much appreciated that this legislation was moved forward i urge my colleagues to strongly support this legislation this member is especially appreciative that he has had the opportunity in the 106th congress to serve on the transportation committee and the water resources and environment subcommittee clearly it has been one of the highlights of the 106th congress for this member this important legislation presents a tremendous opportunity to improve flood control navigation shore protection and environmental protection this member is pleased that the bill we are considering today includes contingent approval for the sand creek watershed project in saunders county nebraska this proposed project which is a result of the lower platte river and tributaries flood control study is designed to meet federal environmental restoration goals help provide state recreation needs solve local flooding problems and preserve water quality it is sponsored jointly by the lower platte north nrd the city of wahoo and saunders county the plans for the project include a nearly 640acre reservoir known as lake wanahoo wetlands restoration and seven upstream sediment nutrient traps the sand creek watershed project would result in important environmental and recreational benefits for the area and has attracted widespread support it is especially crucial that the sand creek project is included in wrda this year as the nebraska department of roads is ready to begin design of a freeway in that area that will be routed across the top of a dam if the project is approved if the sand creek project is not included in wrda a new bridge will have to be planned and built which would make the project not economically feasible with this authorization contingent because of facts yet to be checked and planning study elements yet to be resolved the way is clear to save the taxpayers funds secure mutual project benefits in highway construction and flood control this member is also very pleased that contingent authorization of the antelope creek project is included in wrda 2000 antelope creek runs through the heart of nebraskas capital city of lincoln the purpose of the project is to solve multifaceted problems involving the flood control and drainage problems in antelope creek as well as existing transportation and safety problems all within the context of broad land use issues this member continues to have a strong interest in this project since he was responsible for stimulating the city of lincoln the lower platte south natural resources district and the university of nebraskalincoln to work jointly and cooperatively with the army corps of engineers to identify an effective flood control system for antelope creek in the downtown area of lincoln antelope creek which was originally a small meandering stream became a straightened urban drainage channel as lincoln grew and urbanized resulting erosion has deepened and widened the channel and created an unstable situation a tenfootbytwentyfoot height and width closed underground conduit that was constructed between 1911 and 1916 now requires significant maintenance and major rehabilitation a dangerous flood threat to adjacent public and private facilities exists the goals of the project are to construct a flood overflow conveyance channel which would narrow the flood plain from up to seven blocks wide to the 150foot wide channel the project will include trails and bridges and improve bikeway and pedestrian systems another nebraska project was included on the contingent authorization list is for western sarpy and clear creek for flood damage reduction frankly this member must say he has substantial reservations about the clear creek project in light of concerns expressed by constituents in adjacent saunders county and the lack of enthusiasm by relevant state officials this member reserves judgment whether the benefits outweigh costs and dislocation of property owners in the area this member is pleased that at least part of the language regarding the missouri river valley improvement act that he originally prepared to be offered as an amendment during subcommittee consideration of wrda is included in todays bill last years wrda legislation included a provision this member promoted hich helps to ensure that the missouri river mitigation project can be implemented as envisioned in 1986 congress authorized over 50 million more than 79 million in todays dollars if adjusted for inflation to fund the missouri river mitigation project to restore fish and wildlife habitat that were lost due to the construction of structures to implement the picksloan plan at that time the corps did not choose to include funding requests for implementing that act in their budgeting process that is why this member with assistance from other members who represent the four states bordering the channelized missouri river nebraska iowa kansas and missouri has taken the lead in providing funding to implement the missouri river mitigation project which has just begun to become a reality during the last few years this project is specifically needed to restore fish and wildlife habitat lost due to the federally sponsored channelization and stabilization projects of the picksloan era the islands wetlands and flat floodplains that are needed to support the wildlife and waterfowl that once lived along the river are dramatically reduced an estimated 475 000 acres of habitat in iowa nebraska missouri and kansas have been lost because of federal action in creating the flood control projects and channelization of the missouri river todays fishery resources are estimated to be only onefifth of those which existed in predevelopment days the success of the project has resulted in a concern related to the original study that outlined habitat needs under this study acreage goals for each state were listed and these goals are generally considered to be an acreage limitation for each state nebraska and kansas have already reached their acreage limits and missouri is fast approaching its ceiling before long iowa will also reach its acreage limit to correct this problem the wrda legislation enacted last year authorized provisions initiated by this member to increase mitigation lands in the four states of 25 of the lands lost or 118 650 acres in addition the corps of engineers in conjunction with the four stateswas directed to study the amount of funds that would need to be authorized to achieve that acreage goal the study has been completed and it appears that cost estimates for restoring the acreage authorized in last years wrda will amount to more than 700 million over the next 3035 years this member greatly appreciates the inclusion of an increased authorization level of funding for the missouri river mitigation project of 20 000 000 for each fiscal year from fy2001 through fy2010 this increase would allow the project to better balance the needs of nature recreation and navigation it will also benefit communities preparing for the bicentennial of the lewis and clark expedition beginning in 2003 until funding authorization is increased the corps and the states cannot finalize plans to add habitat restoration identify and prioritize sites for restoration respond to willing sellers or engage in construction or maintenance activities it is important to note that many frequently flooded landowners along the missouri river have asked the corps to buy their land to avoid annual flood losses however in most years the corps has had insufficient funds to meet the needs of these struggling landowners finally the wrda bill also includes legislative language initiated by this member to authorize a pilot program to test the designbuild method of project delivery on a maximum of five civil engineering projects such a program will provide significant benefits and yield useful information in closing this member urges his colleagues to support this important bill in the short time left in the 106th congress we must work to ensure

formation we could not have done a better job our tax system is the largest impediment to people moving from the first rung of the economic ladder to the second because the harder you work the more you save the more you invest the more we take it is a system that is inefficient we have seen testimony from the kemp commission to harvard studies that says for a small business man or woman to comply with the code and to collect and remit 1 in business income taxes it costs them anywhere from 4 to 7 the current code is not understandable our own irs tells us that if you call the irs for help in filling out your own tax return 25 percent of the answers they give you will be given in error over 50 percent of americans have to pay others to decipher the tax code and do their taxes for them in an effort to show how complex the irs code has become money magazine created a fictional american family and asked tax professionals to prepare an irs tax return incredibly every one of the tax professionals came up with a different tax total and not one of the tax professionals calculated what the editors of money magazine believed to be the correct income tax the current code invades

no tax return at all and you would never have to keep a receipt or a record not one let me simply say that any of these proposals as i said earlier any of these tax reform changes would be better than

to strengthen social security by locking away 100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by

wealthiest 2 percent in our country to pass vast fortunes to their heirs without a penny of tax while working families are taxed on every dollar they earn further congress would be passing a greater

budget office estimates that estate and gift tax will generate nearly 50 billion as a result the revenue loss in the second tenyear period explodesto more than 500 billion at a time when our country can least afford it as baby boomerswilt be retiring and social security shifts from cash surplus to deficit it is important to recognize when considering this full repeal of the estate tax relief that only 2 percent of decedents have enough wealth to be subject to the estate tax at all under current law further of the 2 percent of americans subject to the estate tax only 3 percent are small business people or farmers additionally only 6 in 10 000 american estates are farms or small businesses subject to estate tax i believe that we must provide relief to family farms and small businesses

immediately raise the special exclusion from the estate tax from 675 000 to 4 million for a couple owning a farm or small business and would lower the estate tax rates by 20 percent across the board our current strong economy has begun producing surplus federal revenues and as you might imagine there is no shortage of ideas for using the surplus i am in favor of addressing negative effects of the estate tax as evidenced by my past votes but i also believe we should give priority to using these surplus funds to save social security and medicare and pay down the 5 7 trillion national debt surplus funds allow us to pay down the principal on this burdensome debt thus reducing the annual interest payments which amount to approximately 250 billion annually in fact federal reserve chairman alan greenspan stated saving the surplusesif politically feasibleis in my judgement the most important fiscal measure we can take at this time to foster continued improvements in productivity a lower national debt would help reduce interest rates resulting in tremendous cost savings for all american families who make credit card car mortgage and loan payments lower interest rates will also reduce

weird or unfortunately at times even dangerous behavior to get noticed at small schools young people have a better chance to make a sports team or serve on the student council or become a cheerleader

individual attention and individual opportunities gigantic schools unfortunately centralized schools unfortunately breed weird behavior and even help lead to columbinetype situations seconaly this socalled teacher shortage is one of the most artificial contrived and easily solvable problems that we have in the country today there would be no teacher shortage if we removed the straightjacket of education courses and let school boards use intelligence and common sense to hire teachers a school board should be allowed to consider an education degree as a real plus but not be restricted or harmed or hindered by it right now in most places if a person with a ph d in chemistry and 30 years experience in the field wanted to teach he could not do so because he had not taken a few education courses this is ridiculous right now a person with a masters degree in english and who had been a successful writer say for a magazine or for newspapers for years could not be an english teacher in a public school because of not taking a few education courses this is crazy someone who had been a political sgience professor at a small college for several years and then had several years experience on capitol hill for example could not teach american government in a public high school without a required education course this is stupid and it is why we have this artificial governmentinduced

significant federal barrier to a more competitive electric power industry more than 20 years ago the public utility regulatory policies act purpa was enacted as one of the original components of the carter energy plan convinced that we were running out of natural gas and that the price of oil would soar to 100 per barrel or even more by the year 2000 congress passed purpa to encourage conservation and promote the use of renewable fuels to generate electricity it did this by establishing a special class of power generators known as qualifying facilities ofs and it required utilities to buy all the electricity that these facilities wished to sell at a price determined generally by federal regulators and specifically by state regulators congress sought in drafting purpa to ensure that customers would pay no more for purpa power than they would have to pay for other power it did this by providing in purpa that the maximum price for electricity from qfs would be the cost that the purchase utility would have incurred if it had generated the electricity itself or had purchased it from a source other than the qf unfortunately this has not proven to be the case because govemnment projections of utility avoided costs have been seriously in error one recent study estimates that purpa is costing electricity consumers nearly 8 billion a year in excess power costs since over 60 percent of purpa contracts will not expire until after the year 2010 consumers will continue to pay these excess costs well into the future purpa also stands in the way of a more competitive electric industry by granting special status to some electricity generators but not others purpa encourages the creation of uneconomic projects just to qualify for purpa benefits moreover purpa was premised on utilities continuing to be the exclusive suppliers of electricity to all consumers within their franchise territories in many states today customers have the ability to choose their own electric supplier requiring utilities to purchase new purpa power when they may no longer have retail customers to whom they can resell power makes no sense with 20 years of experience behind us it is clear that purpa has outlived its usefulness my legislation would do three things to reform purpa 1 it would prospectively repeal purpas mandatory purchase obligation on the date of enactment so that there would no longer be any new obligations to purchase this power 2 it would respect the sanctity of existing purpa contracts and 3 it would ensure that purchasing utilities would continue to be permitted to recover the costs of existing purpa contracts as long as these contracts are in effect as i said upon introduction of virtually identical legislation during the last two congresses my only interest in introducing this bill lies in achieving the most efficient and most costeffective means of electric generation for americas consumers while it would prospectively repeal purpa and
