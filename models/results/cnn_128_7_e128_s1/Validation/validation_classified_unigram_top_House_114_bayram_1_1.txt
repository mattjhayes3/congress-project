revelations that planned parenthood is harvesting and selling the body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america was meant to be and for those noble americans who died to make it come to be abraham lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation these are indeed days that will be considered in the annals of history and i believe in the councils of eternity itself this bloody shadow has loomed over america for too long it is time for the senate to pass the paincapable unborn child protection act because in spite of all the political noise protecting little paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue it is not a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here it is time for all americans to open our eyes and our hearts to the humanity of

most disturbing is that it is a completely manmade crisis it grew out of the same kind of stubborn faith in austerity measures that has handicapped our ability to govern for years it grew out of a failure to protect the flint river from environmental damage it grew out of both a failure to invest in flints crumbling infrastructure and in the willful disregard for the people of that city a city in which more than 40 percent of the residents live below the poverty line and in which the majority of families are african american my colleagues and i are here on the floor this evening to urge every member of this body to understand one thing if we fail to acknowledge the issues that led to the flint water crisis we will see similar and equally devastating events in more and more cities across the country we need to recognize that tunnel vision for deficit reduction creates more problems than it solves the emergency manager appointed by governor snyder instituted a plan to run flint like a business in order to bring it back from the brink of death in the process he sought out the least expensive options for basic needs like water in doing so he decided to pull from the corrosive and contaminated flint river without ensuring the treatment protocol necessary to ensure the water was clean we now know that although the flint river is in poor shape a little additional spending could have prevented this crisis instead flint went the bare bones route leaving a generation of residents to suffer the permanent consequences congress has once more been so focused on reducing the deficit that we have lost sight of our responsibility to govern only a few months ago did we finally abandon the absurd policy of sequestration which has hampered the functioning of countless programs over the past several years the benefits of austerity and small government are questionable at best flint has proven that and we would all be wise to remember it unfortunately that is not the only lesson that we can take away from this crisis this congress has made undermining environmental and energy regulations one of its core missions in the first 100 days of the 114th congress it voted on more environmental and energy issues than on any other topic and not a single one was aimed at protecting resources like the flint river from the kind of contamination that allowed its water to corrode lead pipes if reducing the deficit has been the first priority for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle allowing corporations and big businesses to take whatever liberties with our environment they choose has to be a close second under the majority of this house our babies would choke on smog before we limit the amount of pollution a single smokestack can spew out our streams and rivers would poison even the fish swimming in them before we would set restrictions on where these companies can dump their chemical byproducts our forests and farmlands would turn barren before we would question the longterm impact of fracking it took years to turn the flint river into the downright dangerous water source that has caused so many problems but for other rivers lakes or streams there may still be time to repair or prevent the damage that we have done flint should move us to strengthen not weaken our environmental protections there is one more lesson to learn here and it is perhaps the most important the infrastructure in flint like in so many other cities is outdated and no one at the local state or federal level seems willing or capable of making the necessary investments today in our oversight and government reform committee hearing one of the topics of concern was that even if individual homes had replaced their old lead pipes the citys pipes would still have caused a major problem that is a matter of infrastructure at the most basic level in my home state of new jersey we spent more than a decade leading the way in the battle against lead poisoning but with the onset of governor christies administration all these advances have also come to an abrupt halt there there are now 11 cities with levels of lead higher than what has been reported in flint right in my state of new jersey this contamination from lead comes from paint instead of water nonetheless it is a reflection of the reduction and diminution of services and resources to make our environment safe for our communities two of these cities are right in my district still governor christies administration has ignored the problem and thoroughly failed our children by choosing not to fund our states lead abatement fund here at the federal level we can take this even further our failure to invest in transportation and energy infrastructure is building up to a crisis of a different kind a time when our roads our bridges and our power grids begin to fail there are so many lessons we need to learn from flint i have a number of colleagues who are here with me this evening

leadership and availability to us in a bipartisan way in our democratic caucus for years irans rapidly accelerating enrichment capability and burgeoning nuclear stockpile has represented one of the greatest threats to peace and security anywhere in the world we all stipulate to that that is why we need an agreement that is why i am so pleased that we have so many statements of validation from

words of diplomats and soldiers generals and admirals and diplomats by the scoredemocrats republicans and nonpartisan we heard from our most distinguished nuclear physicists we heard from those scientists and we heard from people of faith i would like to quote some of them more than 100 democratic and republican former diplomats and ambassadors wrote in our judgment the jcpoa deserves congressional support and the opportunity to show that it can work we firmly believe that the most effective way to protect unitedstates national security and that of our allies and friends is to ensure that toughminded diplomacy has a chance to succeed before considering other more risky alternatives that is the diplomats the generals and admirals wrote there is no better option to prevent an iranian nuclear weapon if the iranians cheat our advanced technology intelligence and the inspections will reveal it and unitedstates military options remain on the table and if the deal is rejected by america the iranians could have a nuclear weapon within a year the choice is that stark twentynine of our nations most prominent nuclear scientists and engineers wrote we consider that the joint comprehensive plan of action the united states and its partners negotiated with iran will advance the cause of peace and security in the middle east and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements i quote and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements this is an innovative agreement with much more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation framework they went on to say more 440 rabbis urged congress to endorse the statement writing the obama administration has successfully brought together the major international powers to confront iran over its nuclear ambitions the broad international sanctions move iran to enter this historic agreement they urge support 4 100 catholic nuns wrote to congress stating as women of faith followers of the one who said blessed are the peacemakers we urge that you risk on the side of peace and vote to approve the iran nuclear deal treasury secretary jack lew

distinguished colleague from california said indeed they would be more likely to blame us for walking away from a credible solution to one of the worlds greatest security threats and would continue to reengage with iran he went on to say instead of toughening the sanctions the decision by congress to unilaterally reject the deal will end a decade of isolation of iran and put the united states at odds with the rest of the world we certainly dont want to do that today something very interesting happened it was a statement put forth by u k prime minister david cameron french president francois hollande and german chancellor angela merkel they wrote an oped for the washington post and said this is an important moment it is a crucial opportunity at a time of heightened global uncertainty to show what diplomacy can achieve this is not an agreement based on trust or any assumption about how iran may look in 10 or 15 years it is based on detailed tightly written controls that are verifiable and longlasting they went on to say we condemn in no uncertain terms that iran does not recognize the existence of the state of israel and the unacceptable language that irans leaders use about israel israels security matters are and will remain our key interests too we would not have reached the nuclear deal with iran if we did not think that it removed a threat to the region and the nonproliferation regime as a whole we are confident that the agreement provides the foundation for resolving a conflict on irans nuclear program permanently this is why we now want to embark on the full implementation of the joint comprehensive plan of action once all national procedures are complete our own president wrote to congressman jerry nadler i believe that jcpoa which cuts off every pathway iran could have to a nuclear weapon and creates the must robust verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program is a very good deal for the united states for the state of

of my grave concern about the genocide occurring against christians alawites shiites druze yazidis and other religious minorities in syria however i was extremely disappointed by amendment language

this amendment is an obvious attempt to make isis look like their cause is legitimate this is absolutely unacceptable and undermines the very heart and intent of this resolution this is very unfortunate because the problem of the genocide against christians yazidis and other religious minorities in syria is very serious in fact the main area in syria where christians and other religious minorities have any protection today from being slaughtered and where they can practice their religious faith without fear of prosecution is in the territory that is still controlled by the syrian government of assad the reality is that the language added to this resolution coupled with its sister resolution house concurrent resolution 121 is really aimed at justifying the overthrow of assad the result of which would be a complete assault and elimination of christians and other religious minorities in syria the fact that this resolution which was originally introduced to increase protection for christians yazidis and other religious minorities has now been hijacked so that it becomes a vehicle to increase the likelihood of an even greater genocide against those religious minorities is an absolute disgrace the reality is that if the assad regime is overthrown tomorrow every christian every yazidi and every other religious minority and ethnic minority in syria will be in even greater danger than ever before from the genocide being perpetrated by isis al qaeda and others who are slaughtering them this resolution is no longer a sincere effort to protect religious

to strengthen opioid abuse treatment and recovery options for those struggling with their addiction the comprehensive opioid abuse reduction act is an important piece of this puzzle while state and

general to make grants available to states and localities for a number of services related to opioid and heroin abuse the grant program contains eight allowable uses of the grant funds which are
