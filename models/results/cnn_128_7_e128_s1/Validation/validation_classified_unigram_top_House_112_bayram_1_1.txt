deficit and longterm debt is to grow our economy to help businesses create jobs at a time when our economy is emerging from the worst recession in our lifetimes when millions of americans are out of work and millions more are struggling to make ends meet this continuing resolution takes exactly the wrong approach instead of making needed investments in education medical research infrastructure and other priorities this bill takes a meat axe to them instead of strengthening the middle class on main street this bill gives sweetheart deals for wall street instead of investing in our workers it protects special interest subsidies for big oil companies and hedge fund managers a few weeks ago on this floor republicans told us that veterans programs education child nutrition and health care research would be protected it is clear now that those were empty promises for veterans the bill eliminates a program that offers housing vouchers for homeless veterans in education the bill decimates the pell grant program by reducing the maximum award by 800 and by cutting another 4 9 billion from other education programs for child nutrition the bill cuts 750 million from the women infants and childrens program and the bill slashes 2 5 billion from the national institutes of health jeopardizing important research into diseases like cancer and alzheimers and diabetes it destroys the land and water conservation fund a commonsense program to preserve and protect our natural resources and outdoor recreational space helping local economies grow when we brought up the prospect of these cuts a few weeks ago we were accused of demonizing the debate now that we have seen the numbers before us i am sad to say it is worse than any of us could have predicted i find the cuts in education funding to be particularly troublesome as president obama made clear in his state of the union we must invest in our children if we are to compete in the 21st century economy in order to maintain our economic standing in order to create the jobs of the future in order to compete against china we must have a welleducated workforce so why on earth would we slash pell grants which help millions of families 12 000 in my district alone pay for college we shouldnt this bill will also decimate important lifesaving food aid programs to feed hungry children and refugees it would literally take the food out of the mouths of some of the most vulnerable people around the world retreating from the global war against extreme poverty and hunger will undermine not just our moral authority but our national security as well i also want to point out that this bill continues the same misguided policy under republican and democratic presidents alike that borrows hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for the wars in iraq and afghanistan if we are truly serious about reducing the deficit then those wars need to be ended or paid for along with my colleagues like walter jones and others im going to continue to talk about this issue these wars are bankrupting us and we need to have a meaningful thorough debate about them so again i believe this continuing resolution contains exactly the wrong

near and too serious not to vote for this agreement i am happy to see that this compromise provides longterm economic certainty raising the debt ceiling until 2013 this will give our markets investors and economic partners abroad confidence in the unitedstates economy and our ability to pay our bills it also takes a bold step toward fiscal responsibility resulting in over 2 1 trillion in deficit reduction as recently scored by the congressional budget office i believe it is important to seriously address our national debt so as not to burden future generations the bill will immediately enact strict tenyear spending caps on both defense and nondefense programs resulting in 917 billion in savings it also creates a bipartisan congressional committee which will identify an additional 1 5 trillion in deficit reduction by november 23 2011 including from entitlement and tax reform both the house and senate will hold an up or down vote on the committees proposal i believe this compromise cuts too far into many important government programs and that these spending reductions will not be easy to swallow discretionary spending will be brought to its lowest levels since the eisenhower administration i am reassured however that cuts will not be made to social security medicaid unemployment insurance programs for lowincome families pell grants for lowincome college students or civilian and military retirement programs i am greatly disappointed that this compromise does not immediately include revenue increases for the wealthiest americans and i believe it places the brunt of the burden of deficit reduction on lowincome and middleclass families i am optimistic however that the future plan set forth by the bipartisan congressional committee on deficit reduction will include such revenue increases instead of protecting tax breaks for big oil corporations that ship jobs overseas and the very richest among us these groups should share in the sacrifice we could each sit here refusing to support a bill that does not mirror our individual priorities allowing the unitedstates to default on its loans and permitting an economic catastrophe or we could come together

lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are less than or equal to emissions from an equivalent conventional fuel produced from conventional petroleum sources in summary my amendment would stop the government from enforcing this ban on all federal agencies funded by the cjs appropriations bill the initial purpose of section 526 was to stifle the defense departments plans to buy and develop coalbased or coaltoliquids jet fuels this stifling was based on the opinion of environmentalists that coalbased jet fuel produces more greenhouse gas emissions than traditional petroleum i recently

last year to exempt the defense department from this burdensome regulation we must ensure that our military has adequate fuel resources and can efficiently rely on domestic and more stable sources of fuel but section 526s ban on fuel choice now affects all federal agencies not just the defense department this is why im offering this amendment again today for the cjs appropriations bill federal agencies should not be burdened with wasting their time studying fuel emissions when there is a simple fix and thats not restricting their fuel choices based on extreme environmental views policies

steady increase over this 38month period of time of his presidency so far gasoline prices have risen an average of about 5 cents per gallon per month this is staggering when we think about the fact

committee i was somewhat surprised when a suggestion was made just a few days ago that there are some who believe there is no relationship between unitedstates production of petroleum and the price of gasoline in the united states that simply is not true and it cannot be true with oil being the input ingredient into gasoline it is the precursor for gasoline anytime we do anything that cuts off or restricts or limits the supply that is necessarily going to have an impact on the price and it does the fact that it is indisputable that there are other factors which also influence the price of gasoline makes it no less true that we have to produce petroleum at home in addition to buying it from other places in order to keep gasoline prices at reasonable levels we have to produce more there are some things we can do in order to help improve that trend for example we could open anwr for drilling we could open our countrys vast federal public lands to development of oil shale it is a little known fact that in three rocky mountain states a small segment of rocky mountain statesutah colorado and wyomingwe have an estimated 1 2 trillion barrels of proven recoverable oil reserves

which is one of our most important partners and coalitions in the region funding for the northern distribution networks and numerous other coalition partners who are helping in the fight against terrorism i wonder if we could talk you into amending your amendment or rewriting your amendment to make it specifically to pakistan and let me say this to you before you answer and then i will yield to you in this bill the money for pakistan cannot be spent we have fenced this moneyall of ituntil the secretary of defense with the concurrence of the secretary of state certifies to congress that the government of pakistan is doing this cooperating with the united states in counterterrorism efforts including taking steps to end support for terrorist groups and preventing them from basing and operating in pakistan and carrying out crossborder attacks pakistan is not supporting terrorist activities against the united states or coalition forces in afghanistan pakistan is not dismantling ied networks and is interdicting precursor chemicals used in making ieds preventing the proliferation of nuclearrelated materials there are four or five more and i wont take the time i want to do what you

strong support of chairman millers managers amendment to h r 1383 the restoring gi bill fairness act of 2011 the bill would increase the cap on tuition and fees set by the post9 11 veterans education assistance improvements act of 2010 passed by congress on december 16 2010 as signed into law by president obama as public law 111377 the new law made several changes to the post9 11 gi bill including imposing a national cap of 17 500 per academic year on tuition and fees paid to private institutions unfortunately the cap will reduce va payments on behalf of up to 30 000 veterans already enrolled in these private schools by thousands of dollars in at least seven states those states would include new york texas michigan pennsylvania arizona south carolina and new hampshire h r 1383 as amended would raise that cap to 27 000 for a period of 3 years for veterans already enrolled in these private schools as of april 1 2011 veterans who enroll after that date would be subject to the 17 500 cap on tuition and fees in determining the amount of the new temporary cap we found that the college board data showed that the average net tuition and fees charged to independent students attending the most expensive tier of private schools was roughly 22 540 therefore we believe that when combined with other federal benefits like pell grants and the post9 11 g i bills yellow ribbon program the vast majority of veterans attending private institutions would not experience outofpocket costs i would also point out that the yellow ribbon program offers schools the opportunity to make up any difference between the basic benefit and actual charges by sharing the difference dollar for dollar with the va finally i support the revised paygo offset by meeting this change we meet our statutory budget rules and allow veterans monthly stipends to reflect the most current amount of basic allowance for housing paid to servicemembers at the e5 with dependents rate i urge my colleagues to support

strongly as i do and states rights as strongly as i do and have you on the appropriations committee i mean what better place for a conservative limitedfederalpower person to be than on the appropriations committee thank you im grateful for the work of john culberson there on our behalf it is supposed to be a government limited as i note the president said previouslytalking about that people interpret this constitution as a bunch of negative powers things the congress cant do or the government cant do we ought to focus on all they can do well i like the fact that all that congress all that the presidency all that judiciary is supposed to be able to do is specified everything else as my friend mr culberson pointed out is resolved to the states and the people congress has this power to create the courts federal courts states take care of their own state system its one of the reasons though that i voted against a couple of bills recently because medical malpractice reform was being dictated from here in congress for every state in the country i love what texas did with medical malpractice reform in its state court system but its a state court system i also know that if the congress decides we need to start dictating to every state what their state court system can or cant do then when a far more liberal congress comes in they will be able to say look you socalled conservative republicans dictated to the states what their state tort law should be so now were going to dictate to the states what we think it should be and it ends up being a federal takeover of something that is entirely a state system when it comes to the states tort system the state court system its none of our business unless there is an adequate federal nexus thats guided a couple of votes that may have surprised people that i made but i simply could not support federal takeover of state tort law here is a supreme court decision from 1922 never been overruled in that the court saidits at 260 unitedstates 226 klein v burke construction company it says only the jurisdiction of the supreme court is derived directly from the constitution every other court created by the general government derives its jurisdiction wholly from the authority of congress that body may give withhold or restrict such jurisdiction at its discretion provided it be not extended beyond the boundaries fixed by the constitution thats exactly what the constitution intended congress can create federal district courts federal commissionswhatever drug court immigration court whatever we feel appropriate as an inferior court to the unitedstates supreme court we can do it under article i section 8 or article iii in my amendment to give people adequate feeling of protection we wanted to ensure that peoples rights would be adequately protected and no presidentwhether it would be the prior republican president this democratic president or the next presidentwould have the power that should not be his were it not for an overyielding united states congress the amendment the gohmertlandry original amendmentoriginally the landry original amendmentjust said nothing in the authorization for use of military force or in the national defense authorization act shall be construed to deny the availability of the writ of habeas corpus that was what came from the committee i was very grateful to jeff landry and scott rigell for allowing me to discuss and negotiate and work with them but thats what went to committee i wasnt comfortable that that protected americans rights because we still had the provision in the authorized use of military force from september 18 2001 that said the president still had all this power and he could detain people indefinitely that is a reasonable interpretation of this aumfnot the ndaa but the aumf that was a reasonable interpretation of the 2001 aumf and so to simply say someone would have the right to a writ of habeas corpus in a hearing on that habeas corpus proceeding was not adequate for me to gather back to the american people the rights that should be theirs if it were not for the aumf so the proceeding without further amendment to that language could have gone like this an american citizen is ordered detained by the president of the united states he is taken to military detention he is placed therein he would get a writ of habeas corpus hearinghabeas corpus meaning to surrender the body youve got to bring the body forward ive had writ of habeas corpus hearings as a judge many times you have to determine is there sufficient evidence more likely than not that this person committed acts that justify the detention and the retaining of his body in that detention if the courts give proper credence to the 2001 aumf then the court would have that hearing and say okay there is evidence that makes it more likely than not that this person the writ applicant committed acts that authorize the president under the 2001 act to place him in indefinite detention in a military facility so there he would have had his writ hearing but hes still in indefinite detention in a military facility in my 4 years in the army i became very familiar with those military facilities so i began checking with constitutional scholars i respected i even got back with my old con law professor i started running different language by how about if we say this how about if we say that and others would make suggestions and we would tweak the language this has been going on for weeks well lets change this word well what if we add this phrase and that phrase well that doesnt really do it because youve still got this problem and so it was great talking with people who are really thinking and trying hard to come up with a solution and the goal that i had and in talking with mr landry mr rigell mr duncan and mr barletta the goal is very simple the authorization for the use of military force from september 18 2001 gave the president unbridled discretion in confining detaining american citizens and others we wanted to put american citizenswe wanted to put people who were lawfully in the united states in the same situation they were in before the unlimited gift of power from the legislative branch to the executive branch i wasnt here but im sure a week after 9 11 while we were still reeling and those of us in other places had just been out on our courthouse square holding hands singing hymns praying together hoping praying that our country would not be attacked again and so many peoples lives lost destroyed so many losing hope crushed to know theyd never see their family member never even be able to have a legitimate funeral with their loved ones remains im sure i know that people meant to do the best they could to protect the country but 10 years later 11 years later almost we can look back and we could restrain that power once again so that was the goal lets get people back to the position they were in the day before this incredible extension of power to the president was given so the language that with the help of others smarter than i we were able to put together to get us to that day before this incredible grant of power to the president was that nothing in the authorized use of military force act from 2001 nothing in the ndaa from months ago nothing from the ndaa that were taking up now nothing was going to be construed to deny the availability of writ of habeas corpus which were the landry rigell words and then heres the additional language or to deny any constitutional rights in a court ordained or established by or under article iii of the constitution for any person who is lawfully in the united states when detained pursuant to the authorized use of military force act and actually and we looked at this a number of different ways a lot of scholars just by referencing the authorized use of military force act from 2001 it actually includes the subsequent amendment to that aumf by the ndaa some months back or the amendment that we voted on today the ndaa is actually an amendment to the aumf some had asked louie why did you say deny any constitutional rights in a court ordained or established under article iii constitute for any personwhy didnt you just say american citizens thats who were most concerned about and again i come back to this i wanted to get back to where we were before this incredible extension of power to the president occurred for people who were lawfully in the united states i dont have any sympathy for people who may be sneaking across the board as we speak through tunnels or over fences or through openings in fences or across rivers ive got no sympathy for people coming in who want to destroy our way of life and are sneaking in illegally to destroy this life we have and the freedoms and liberties we have so those who are not lawfully in the united states who are trying to do us harm killing americans destroying people this is not for them but for anyone who is lawfully in the united states we want to return them to the same position of liberty they had before the unbridled extension of power to the president september 18 2001 to do that thoughthere are people who were lawfully here in the united states not unitedstates citizens but people who were lawfully here who committed acts whether of violence or other things who before this extension of power to the president in 2001 had no right to go into a federal district court they had the right to go to an immigration court and thats it no right to go before an article iii court and so we wanted to make sure that for those people who did not have a right to get a full jury trialimmigrants do not have that right theyre subject to the immigration courts if theyre going to be deported they go to the immigration court they dont have a right to go have a federal trial in a united states district court over whether or not they get to stay in the united states thats been ruled on many times they dont get that kind of court so weve added the language at the end of subparagraph a who is otherwise entitled to the availability of such writ or such rights so we reestablished in the gohmert landry rigell amendment and duncan and barletta as well in that amendment we reestablish that for anynot just any american citizen but anybody lawfully in the united states that is entitled to these rights before september 18 of 2001 youre entitled to them again and nothing in the aumf nothing in the ndaa from months ago nothing in the ndaa today all amending the aumf nothing in this shall be construed to deny those rights to an individual now my good friend justin amash he wanted to fix things but actually his fix extended new rights that did not exist prior to september 18 of 2001 and i understand his intentions and although i did not appreciate my friend mr smith alluding to a smokescreen you dont spend hours and hours and hours trying to perfect language to create a smokescreen you do that to fix legislation and thats what i believe we did thats what i believe weve done today here on the house floor but having been in the military and having continued as a member of congress to go to each funeral of people who as lincoln said gave the last full measure of devotion for their country having attended all of those in my district over the last 7 years i know the price our military pays i know the rights that you give up when you go into the military and so people without realizing the full scope of the different types of rights to different types of people in the constitution who say everybodys entitled to constitutional rights under the bill of rights under the constitution yeah but theyre different rights and youre in the military you dont have a right to freedom of speech so we had a young man a devoted member of the united states military who said some very bad things about our president unflattering things whether or not theyre truthful is not the issue for a member of the military it is under a matter of the uniform code of military justice that was created by congress because congress has that power under article i section 8 to create that court system and to not give members of the military all of the rights that everybody else in america has there were some mornings at 5 that i would love to have had the freedom of assembly and that i would have loved to have had the freedom of speech to tell my commander where he could go with his assembly at 5 and with the 25mile march that was going to follow that that was a time when we were not at war nonetheless you have to have discipline in the military even though i may have totally agreed with the commentsi dont know what all of them were but this individual is in the militarywhen youre in the military you do not have the right to criticize anyone in the chain of command and it has to be that way in my heart i was so deeply offended by the way in which president carter was failing to do anything about our hostages and about the act of war that was perpetrated against our embassy under everybodys interpretation of international law an attack on a countrys embassy is an act of war against that country it should have provoked a response from this country that made so clear to all of those radical islamists that attacked our embassy in 1979 that when you attack the united states of americain our embassy or on our home soil either onetheyre both acts of war and we will respond you will not get away with an act of war like that against us because we failed to respond in any measurable manner other than for so long just basically begging them to give us our people back we appeared to be a paper tiger we appeared to be a country that didnt have the guts to step up and protect itself that fact is still being used to recruit people around the world to these radicalized groups of islamists though i felt strongly about the impropriety of the way the president was handling those things in 1979 and 1980 it was not appropriate for a member of the military to publicly ever criticize a commander in his chain of command thats what the commander in chief is so whether or not any of us agrees with the soldier who criticized president obama you have to have discipline in the military and thats not appropriate so why shouldnt he have had the right to come before an article iii court and say hey im a member of the military what happened to my freedom of speech rights under the constitution congress has the power to set up the rules and the rights for the military and you dont have that right because weve got to have a disciplined military for immigrants many have said why dont i have the right to go get a jury trial and prove my case why your country should be forced to allow me to stay here its because you dont have that right under our constitution the right you have under our constitution is to go to an immigration court there are exceptions of course but thats the main right we have the authorization and the power under the constitution to create those systems and as my friend mr culberson pointed out theyre limited to what is prescribed in the constitution so that subparagraph a was the extent of the gohmertlandryrigell amendment originally but there were others who were concernedbut look look what if the president does detain somebody even though he doesnt have the power to detain if this subparagraph a passes and becomes part of the law then the president wont have the power to detain an american citizen or an american lawfully in this court who he didnt have the power to detain before september 18 of 2001 but what if he does that anyway and it has happened people abuse their power we know that so what if it happens that a president abuses the power that he does not have lets get that right to a writ of habeas corpus hearing so that you can come forward and establish and bring out the gohmertlandryrigell amendment and say look that authorized use of military force in 2001 that gave the president the power to just detain people indefinitely including in a military confinement got changed today in the house in 2012 therefore at the writ hearing that would be granted under subparagraph c the judge would have to say youre right i see that gohmertlandryrigell amendment the president doesnt have the right to do that anymore so were going to have to let you go but the key would be to get a writ hearing in order to advocate the proper position of the law as changed in subparagraph a because if you cant come before a judge then nobody is going to have the power to order you released so i could understand that since i know extremely well that i sure dont have a corner on the market of best language i realizeand our friend bob goodlatte was pushing this issue and i know bob to be a brilliant lawyer just a great american patriot i know whether we agree or not on every issue when bob goodlatte talks about an issue i ought to listen because hes a smart caring man i realize he has got a point which is that a does fix the problem according to the people that i worked with and checked with and we worked the language together to get it to work but hes right what if the president does detain somebody against what the law says in a how do you get that heard okay we added subparagraph b that says not later than 48 hours after the date on which a person who is lawfully in the united states is detained pursuant to the authorization for use of military force the president shall notify congress of the detention of such person so the president if he does detain somebody against the law in section 103 subparagraph a has got to notify us then im sure there would be a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who would come forward and say hey weve changed the law the president cant do that under subparagraph a you dont have that power anymore we took that away from you the way you had it since september 18 of 2001 that has changed now that youve notified us we are going to help that person file for a writ of habeas corpus hearing in court as specified in subparagraph a it will be an article iii unitedstates federal district court and we know we will have a proper hearing thats why subparagraph c says a person who is lawfully in the united states when detained pursuant to the authorization for use of military force shall be allowed to file an application for habeas corpus relief in an appropriate district court not in an immigration court not in a military tribunal but in a federal district courtnot later than 30 days after the date on which the person is placed in military custody now there are some whove tried to say in the last couple of days that actually this gohmertlandryrigell amendment restricted the right of writs of habeas corpus hopefully they meant well but the truth is were aware of writs of habeas corpus that happen long after 30 days there is no requirement that if there is ever going to be a writ of habeas corpus hearing that it has to be within 30 days so what we were doing was not restricting the right of writs of habeas corpus we were actually making them stronger so that the president unless he is going to break the law and act illegally by not notifying congress within 48 hourswell guess what things have a way of working the truth out and if the president were to violate this kind of law it might be the basis for an impeachment proceeding to go around and to intentionally violate the law this is serious stuff we knew by putting it in the law it would give that kind of ability to congress to enforce what weve done with regard to my friend justin amash and adam smiths amendment it appeared to be a choice with their amendment it was going to give new rights to terrorists that would be greater than any member of our united states military has or under the gohmertlandryrigell amendment it would return the power to people that they had before september 18 2001 this unlimited ability of the president to detain people indefinitely in potentially a military detention facility i appreciated the bipartisan support for our amendment today we had democrats that voted with us on this issue people that care very deeply about this issue we had republicans that did not vote with us i think 19 republicans didnt vote with us but i believe 243 people from both sides of the aisle voted for this amendment to fix this power we needed to rein in the power of the presidency and we did that im very grateful to heritage for embracing the concept that was pursued here rather than a concept that would extend greater rights to terrorists on american soil than our own american soldiers would have i think its a good day i think its a good day people have heard me talk about how we have messed up whats going on in afghanistan the taliban was defeated they were routed we had less than 1 500 americans in afghanistan when the taliban was defeated and so many americans have forgotten but for so much of the iraq war people were sayingnow the way the taliban was defeated in afghanistan thats the way to fight a war on foreign soil you empower the enemy of our enemy give them support we gave them aerial support we gave them embedded special ops and intelligence people that were a tremendous help ive heard that personally the biggest hero of those battles general dostum i met with again just last month that was over in afghanistan theyre our allies for those that say you republicans are a bunch of xenophobes or islamaphobes these are muslim friends they buried family and friends while americans were burying family and friends because they had fought together they initially defeated the taliban and they did it very effectively then we began to add troops by the tens of thousands and we became occupiers in afghanistan we began to pour billions and billions and billions of dollars into afghanistan then pakistan began supporting the taliban and they continue to support the taliban and were continuing to support pakistan another good thing today was amendments that said hey pakistan if youre going to keep funding our enemies and helping our enemies were not going to keep giving you any funds that was another good measure that got bipartisan support today that was a good measure but as long as weve got troopsi dont think president obama has handled this very well in afghanistan i think hes gotten some bad advice i think president bush got some bad advice but as long as we have troops on foreign soil we should never again do what was done to our military in vietnam yank their feet out from under them and leave our allies to be killed with that i

priority to hold a vote here in the house to repeal obamacare so early in the first session of the 112th congress we saw a vote here that was bipartisan and it was unanimous among republicans to repeal obamacare that is a very sound a ringing sound rejection of obamacare by the american people as a result of the election of november 2 by the people they sent here 87 new freshmen republican many of them very very solid then after h r 2 passed the house with unanimous republican support and bipartisan support it went over to the senate where they said it could never pass over here and its a symbolic vote well the republican leader mitch mcconnell did force a vote on the repeal of obamacare it would have taken 60 votes to break the filibuster under those rules well every republican in the united states senate voted to repeal obamacare so we are in this situation today where if you look in the house and in the senate with far larger republican numbers than we have had in past years every republican in the house and the senate has voted to repeal obamacare every single one they are serious and they want to get the job done and their constituents insist that we get the job done as well so now that we have taken this position that we are all of us for repealing obamacare and consistent with two thirds of the american people if we voted to repeal it it would be completely inconsistent for us to vote then to turn around and fund obamacare well if the cr has language in it that allows for funding of obamacare then a vote in support of the continuing resolution is a vote that funds the very thing that we voted to repeal which would be inconsistent and i do not believe that we will have inconsistent members here in the house of representatives i think they voted to repeal obamacare i think they are happy to vote to cut off the funding to obamacare and i believe that we will have universal support for that among our conference and i believe the senate if they have an opportunity for the vote would do the same thing down party lines perhaps but they would do the same thing but herein is the difficulty and its this that the funding that might otherwise be in this continuing resolution or may perhaps actually come out tomorrow in it is not very large in comparison to the overall cost the chairman of the budget committee has said that the spending under obamacare is 2 6 trillion 2 6 trillion now there are taxes enacted by it and we know how the cbo scored the information that they were given but 2 6 trillion in spending would be shut off if we repealed obamacare today we have voted to do so in the house the senate wasnt successful the president likely would veto it is his signature bill it is his identity he is the one that called it obamacare at the blair house february 25 and now its in our dictionary my spell check spells it out for me obamacare but in any case the 1 billion or so that might be cut out of obamacare in the cr if we say none of the funds that are written into this bill can be used to implement or enforce obamacare that 1 billion pales by comparison to the funds that are automatically appropriated that are written into the obamacare bill itself and it is an unusual practice to have that happen when you have a large authorization bill like obamacare come through generally it authorizes the appropriations they are authorized to be appropriated under this section x many dollars to go to implement or enforce the various provisions of obamacare thats where the money is and the real money thats up in that thats automatically appropriated obamacare anticipates and authorizes trillions of dollars to be appropriated to fund it and it authorizes the collection of i believe trillions of dollars in fees and taxes to fund it over time but the automatic appropriations that are unusual but written into obamacare that a lot of people didnt know was in there when it was voted on they will automatically appropriate a number that approaches or exceeds 100 billion in automatic appropriations we are crunching these numbers now and i have to qualify these numbers our low number is down around 65 3 billion our upper number is up around 107 billion crs doesnt have a number cbo doesnt have a number apparently nobody has pressed them to produce the numbers of the automatic appropriations in obamacare in all this time so we are taking this apart and putting it back together and thats why the range is its my shop doing the math on this range 65 3 billion on the low side 107 billion on the high side lets just call it around 100 billion for round figures we could come here on the floor next week and debate a cr and we could see an amendment come thats in order that would cut off all funding in the cr that would be used to fund obamacare if we do that we are cutting off about 1 2 billion in spending if we bring an amendment that shuts off all the funding thats automatically appropriated in obamacare and if we are successful we shut off maybe 100 billion that would be used to implement and enforce obamacare one billion versus 100 billion a 1 percent solution versus a 100 percent solution and if we dont use the 100 percent solution then 100 billion as much as or perhaps more will be aggressively used by the obama administration to implement and enforce obamacare and if they do that the cancerous tumor thats growing because of what it does to our liberty and our freedom sends its roots down deeper and it gets bigger and stronger and harder to eradicate that is part of the strategy so i am hopeful that leadership and the chairman of the appropriations committee will get together and sometime tonight as they put the finishing touches on the cr legislation that they say will come out tomorrow that they will write into the bill the language that i have proposed and since we deal with 2 500 page bills here in the house and we are chastised if we dont read and understand every word of them i have an amendment here that i can read every word of and perhaps it could be understood by everyone in america this is the amendment that shuts off the automatic appropriations to obamacare it is this and i quote notwithstanding any other provision of law none of the funds made available in this act or any previous or subsequent act may be used to carry out the provisions of public law 111148 public law 111152 or any amendment made by either such public law thats the amendment that shuts off not just the funding in the cr to obamacare but it shuts off the selfenacting automatic appropriations that were i believe inappropriately written into the obamacare bill and the reconciliation package that came over from the senate as part of their deal that is why i gave you two bill numbers instead of one but they encompass what we commonly refer to as obamacare that is the amendment that needs to be made in order here on the floor that allows the house to work its will that allows the house to work within order under the rules and by the way regular order is holding committee meetings holding hearings holding subcommittee markups and subcommittee appropriations chairman rehberg would be seated at one of those markups i would think and that would be useful a full appropriations committee markup at all of those stops there would be an opportunity to introduce this language in committee and then succeed i believe in dealing with a parliamentary challenge or if its written into the base bill certainly there would be no parliamentary challenge and if this goes out of the appropriations committee up to the rules committee and doesnt have my language in it at that point the rules committee can protect this language from a point of order but if i bring this language to the floor under an appropriations bill i know that i am facing a parliamentary challenge to this language and it will be hard for the house to work its will if we get to the point where we have a parliamentary challenge on a piece of language that mirrors the will of the american people mirrors the wishes of the american people and mirrors the will and wishes of the members of congress the majority of the members of congress and mirrors the will and the wishes and the votes of 100 percent of the republicans in the united states house and the united states senate and is bipartisan at least in the house that is the endeavor that we need to be successful with and i am very determined to have this kind of debate and find a way to have this vote if we are blocked from a vote that is essential to work the will of the house how then can we say how then can we say that the house has worked its will if the house has been denied an opportunity to work its will i know there are arguments on both sides but i would point out that the language that i have read into the record is not a precedent it doesnt stretch the rules or the history or the traditions of this house it doesnt stretch any written rule that i know of and it is this there is ample precedent ample precedent in the form of the appropriations bills that were used to shut off the funding for the vietnam war now i disagreed with the decision back then i remember reading about it in the news in 1973 and 1974 in fact my recollection says also 1975 but i dont happen to have those notes

aisle have argued that these grants encourage flexibility by promoting state control of the exchanges yet this argument is based on the premise that states can actually design the right health care plan for their citizens under the patient protection and affordable care act but when you look at the law you understand that this concept is actually not true in reality the relationship between the states and washington the states are the servant not a partner of washington under this health care law the secretary of health and human services will control what benefits must be bought must be bought in an exchange a benevolent central planner and i underscore the word benevolent but a benevolent central planner will decide whether you your doctor your nurse your clinic your hospital can provide care to you through an exchange plan a regulation writer at the department of health and human services will decide whether or not your health savings account complies with their rules rather than promote local control the patient protection and affordable care acts exchanges have only the veneer of providing states flexibility and they certainly rob an individual and they rob families of health care choice even if they are happy with the coverage that they currently have the welch amendment does not authorize a grant program for states to establish exchanges that is exchanges written with a lower case e but rather health benefit exchanges all caps that are contemplated in the patient protection and affordable care act section 1321 of the bill has the title state flexibility in operation and enforcement of exchanges but a reading of that section shows the title could not be anymore misleading the section is littered with phrases such as other requirements the secretary determines appropriate or words such as the secretary determines that an electing state has not taken the actions the secretary determines necessary section 1311 k i have referenced that previously section 1311 k states that an exchange may not establish rules that conflict with or prevent the application of regulations issued by the secretary i am encouraged that the supporter of the amendment believes that we should not provide the secretary with a blank check however i oppose this amendment because it perpetuates the idea that the federal government should dictate how states establish exchanges last year we were told we need to read the bill to know what is in it today i ask those here in this body to ignore the rhetoric and actually read the bill those who do will clearly see that
