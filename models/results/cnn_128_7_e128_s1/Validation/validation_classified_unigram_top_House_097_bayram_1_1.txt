bronx and the message is loud and clear oppose president reagans cuts i share the concerns of my constituents apparently the public outcry against these proposals is so great that the administration is slowly backing away from them certainly the 960 vote in the senate against the cuts and the unanimous vote of the house democratic caucus against them should convince the administration to abandon its intolerable proposals which run counter to president reagans campaign pledges these cuts must not become law i shall do what i can to see that they do not certain groups would be hit especially hard by the cuts there would be a onethird cut for the totally disabled and a 40percent cut for those forced to retire before age 62 these cuts which would save 82 billion over the next 5 years are far greater than is necessary to insure the stability of the social security system president reagan and budget director david stockman are not attempting to protect the social security system their intent is to balance the budgetand on the backs of senior citizens their dependents and the disabled these proposals would break faith with millions and millions of workers who have contributed to the social security system let us not forget that social security represents a compact between a worker his employer and the federal government the reagan proposals if enacted would tear that compact asunder benefits are a rightan earned rightand any attempt to cut these benefits would be a statement that the unitedstates government is not as good as its word the reagan administration has claimed that only one of its proposalsthe delay in the effective date of the costofliving adjustmentwould affect current retirees unfortunately this is not the case the administration has proposed eliminating the minimum 122 social security benefit for 3 million people now receiving it such persons would see their benefits calculated to reflect their actual earnings many of them would not lose money spouses benefits and ssi payments would make up for any loss but there are some 1 5 million people who would see their income reduced tragically these would be our most needy senior citizens in fact tens of thousands of americans above the age of 90 would be hit hard if this proposal became law president reagan would also cut benefits for 800 000 students who are survivors and dependents of workers these students would have their benefits cut 25 percent the first year 50 percent the second year 75 percent the third year and then eliminated in the fourth year this would badly hurt thousands of middle and lowincome students many of whom would be forced to end their educations current recipients would also be hurt by the proposals to delay the tcostofliving adjustment cola from july to october and to base the cola on a costofliving comparison over a full year rather than two calendar quarters as is now done the costofliving adjustment must be protected there are those who argue that the present cola is too high because it is based on the increase in prices rather than on wages i disagree it is perhaps true that the consumer price index on which we base the cola overstates the impact of increases in housing costs but in three other areasfood fuel costs and medical expensesthe cpi does not reflect the special needs of the elderly in these areas the elderly suffer from higher costs more than the average midleaged person the administrations proposal to drastically cut benefits for future early retirees is especially brutal most people who take the age 62 retirement option do so because they are sick or because they were forced out of their jobs now the administration announces that it will cut benefits for early retirees by some 40 percent and that this cut will go into effect in just 7 months this is terribly unfair today workers retiring at 62 receive 80 percent of their full entitlement each year that ratio goes up so that those retiring at 65 receive the full 100 percent entitlement but the administration would reduce that 80 percent entitlement to 55 percent over his expected lifetime the average person would lose 31 percent of their benefits by retiring early this is no social security reform it is a travesty and if enacted would undermine and tend to destroy public faith in the social security system fortunately this proposal has very little chance of passage the administration has also proposed changing the benefit computation formula for all future retirees by 1987 this change would permanently reduce monthly benefits by approximately 10 percent this will result from the reduction in the socalled replacement rate today a retiree receives an average of 42 percent of his or her 30year average earnings president reagan would reduce that replacement rate to 38 percent this will especially hurt low and mediumincome workers who in most cases will have no other income besides social security benefits after retirement the presidents proposal would also cut disability benefits by severely tightening eligibility requirements today disability is determined by looking at a number of variables in addition to medical factors the determination takes into account experience age and training obviously a condition that would disable a 60yearold bricklayer might not disable a secretary or a clerk the reagan proposal would not permit examiners to look at the whole person the only criterion considered would be medical condition the administration would also require applicants for disability insurance to have worked 7 years out of the last 10 and also 1 years out of the last 3 years this will badly hurt those suffering from degenerative diseases who may not have been incapacitated at a single moment in time but over the course of years such people are often employed only intermittently before meeting the definition of totally disabled under the reagan proposal a person suffering from a disease like multiple sclerosis might not be disabled enough to qualify for disability insurance but might suffer enough from the condition to be rendered basically unemployable by the time this person became totally disabled he might be rendered ineligible for benefits because of the test of recent earnings these proposals are as unnecessary as they are unfair the administration argues that these proposals will save the social security system from bankruptcy if forsees an 11 billion deficit in the trust funds by 1986 but the cuts proposed to eliminate this deficit would not save 11 million they would save more than 82 billion by 1986 clearly these cuts are part of an administration strategy to balance the budget while at the same time increasing defense expenditures and cutting taxes at one time it was charged that such a feat could only be accomplished with mirrors we now know that it is possible to achieve these goals without mirrorsby taking billions of dollars out of the social security system i am confident that the congress will not permit this to happen there is a shortterm social security financing problem but it can be resolved by allowing the three social security funds to borrow from each other we can also permit the trust funds to borrow from the treasury particularly during times of high unemployment when contributions to the system dwindle the longrange financing problem if it ever develops must be addressed through partial general revenue funding of social security this was forseen by social securitys original sponsors in the 1930s it may be inevitable and it is certainly preferable to cutting benefits i have always favored this approach after all the wellbeing of our senior citi zens is certainly worthy of funding by the treasury these general revenue dollars are tax dollars which come out of the pockets of each and every one of us here we have an administration which is willing to spend billions and billions on the pentagonwith no conoern for costbut which shrinks in horror at the thought of using our tax revenues to pay social security benefits i trust that the congress will not be bamboozled into enacting these illconsidered and punitive proposals by the administrations talk about averting the bankruptcy of the social security system that system cannot and will not be allowed to go bankrupt the administration must understand that cutting benefits does not solve the problem of social security financing on the contrary cuts in benefits are the very disasters we must work to avoid i will fight these proposals and will do what i can to see that the social security system remains on a sound footing without unfair and regressive cuts a balanced budget is a desirable goal but a budget that is balanced on the backs of senior citizens is a travesty the reagan cuts in social security benefits must be rejected"], [0.03821779415011406, 0.03821779415011406, 0, "i than the gentleman for yielding and i especially thank the gentleman for

reimbursement for temporary lodging when changing duty stations emergency home leave for those stationed overseas consolidation of authority for hazardous duty pay and an increase in the ceiling for

detailed hearings on h r 3380 with witnesses from the office of the secretary of defense the military aervices and the gleneral accounting office the overwhelming substance of the testimony clearly dictates that the military pay raise for october 1 should be targeted the committee believes that a pay raise as high as 22 percent should be granted to the more highly zvilled and experienced enlisted personnel who are in short supply with others receiving raises in varying lesser amounts but with no one receiving a raise of less than 7 percent the net effect of our proposal is to give a pay raise that will average 14 3 percent as opposed to the acrosstheboard proposal of 14 3 percent recomnmended by the armed services committee i am committed to making the allvolunteer force work however the approach recommended by the armed services committee would leave the pay tables in the same proportion that was designed in the early 1970s without making any adjustments by pay grade based upon almost a decade of experience just as field testing is used to make needed adjustments in the design of a tank or aircraft before it is put into longterm production we should use the accumulated evidence of nearly 10 years experience to make military compensation support the allvolunteer force in the most economic manner possible the relationship between career and entry pay has significantly eroded over the years to the point that today a promotion to sergeant the beginning of the career force will gain an individual only 20 a month in basic pay how can we convince it highly qualified young person that increased responsibility in the military is adequately compensated all the services are seriously short of skilled personnel in the appropriations committee report on the fiscal year 1981 defense budget we estimated that dod was short over 100 00 ncos those numbers have changed little over the last year many of our army divisions are not ready because of these shortfalls the navy must juggle crews in order to get marginally ready ships to sea air force maintenance personnel shortages reduce the number of planes we can put into the air according to the

force by 19 000 trained and experienced leaders our proposal and the one supported by the senate armed services committee is to give a pay raise that will average 14 3 percent as opposed to the acrosstheboard proh16172 co posal of 14 3 percent contained in the initial version of h r 3380 there is strong support in the military services for a targeted pay increase army chief of staff e c

one of the first actions they took was to arrest wallenberg for suspicion of spying the charges were unfounded and the act unpardonable instead of being hailed as a hero wallenberg was carted off as a common criminal today a mystery surrounds the fate of raoul wallenberg since his incarceration by the soviets 36 years ago after repeated inquires as to his fate the soviets issued a statement claiming mr wallenberg died of a heart attack in 1974 however former prisoners in the soviet gulag system have claimed to have seen a man resembling mr wallenberg during their confinement in 1975 a russian jew jan kaplan met a swede in the butyrka prison who had been imprisoned for 30 years but still seemed healthy if this man is raoul wallenberg then the soviets are once again heinously guilty of repression and the denial of human rights why will the soviets not reveal the real truth about raoul wallenberg how much longer must we accept the lies and falsehoods offered to us by them hopefully the actions we are taking today as representatives of the people of the united states will help clear up the mystery of raoul wallenberg if he is alive after all these years of unnecessary penal servitude then grant him his freedom so that he can live out the remainder of his years with dignity if he is dead then perhaps the knowledge of his fate will permit his soul to rest in peace regardless of his fate i am both proud and honored to join with my colleagues in asking the congress of the united states to bestow honorary citizenship upon raoul wallenberg"], [0.9706249833106995,

provision the urgent supplemental which is now before the house does not contain the 3 billion housing subsidy i support this bill and i will vote to override the presidents veto this bill contains some 44 individual items totaling 5 9 billion in budget authority 5 7 billion in rescissions 36 million in transfers and 8 million for the liquidation of 1981 obligations the bill reimposes the 3 000 limit on tax deductions for members living expenses on a bill which contains that many items and that much money the position of any member must be a matter of individual conscience and individual judgment my own judgment is that this bill should be enacted into law the objections of the president notwithstanding we have been debating urgent supplementals since march and on at least 4 different bills so i would like to takxe a minute to summarize for the members of the house the items contained in the bill before us first of all the bill contains 15 separate items which have been designated as urgent by the administration 3 billion for food stamps urgent transfers for programs in the department of labor and the department of health and human services appropriations for the pell grant program in the department of education 2 4 billion for epa construction grants urgent appropriations for the cab the icc the merit systems protection board administrative expenses in the department of commerce social security mailing costs the unitedstates customs service the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and 1 billion for food stamps the bill contains a number of other appropriations which have been added by the congress 63 million for summer youth employment 210 million for community service employment for older americans 00 million for health services 57 million for the work incentives program 23 million for refugee assistance 24 million for the corporation for public broadcasting 150 for the government national mortage association 48 million for the coast guard 103 million for the federal highway administration 2 7 million for the secret service 62 million for the postal service 6 5 million for the national archives and records service 1 5 million for the tax court 2 million for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for weather stations 40 million for the corps of engineers for use in the mount st helens area i believe the president was right to veto the first urgent supplemental the bailout for the housing industry was a precedent we simply could not afford to set i supported him on that issue and on that issue alone the bailout issue has been settled in the presidents favor the first urgent supplemental was reported by the committee on appropriations in march since that time the urgent supplementals for fiscal 1982 have been frustrated and delayed by 4 months of demogogery and political chicken it is easy to see the importance of 1 3 billion for student loans it is not so easy to see the consequences for innocent federal workers the merit systems protection board has been forced to furlough some 300 workers those workers are in effect being paid half time i ask my colleagues how would you like to support your families and to pay your bills on halftime pay these employees and others have suffered enough from the political games that have been played with these supplementals this bill should be enacted and i will vote to override the veto because of the delay in final enactment of this urgent supplemental appropriations bill the merit systems protection board has been forced to curtail its operations drastically and place its employees on halftime halfpay furloughs inasmuch as there was no certainty as to when or whether the urgent supplemental would be passed the board had to slow its rate of spending remaining funds in order to allow for a skeletal operation to continue if the urgent supplemental question is settled the board will be able to resume full operations with the supplemental funds and it will be able to use the remaining funds under the continuing resolution to pay its employees for the time lost due to the emergency situation it is my understanding that an agency may place employees on administrative leave or excused absence for short periods of time when i has been forced to shut down in whole or in part for emergency or management reaspns in this case the boards furlough was forced by its efforts to maintain a minimal level of operations when there were no assurances that a supplemental appropriation would be approved and signed thus allowing the necessary funds for fulltime operations it seems to me that the board took the only reasonable course available to it under the circumstances when it furloughed its employees instead of spending ahead as if everything was a certainty they attempted to stretch out their remaining funds in case there was no urgent supplemental it would be unfair to penalize the employees because of the failure of congress to pass the necessary legislation to allow the board to operate atfull scale i consider the boards action to be responsible management and in my opinion once the urgent supplemental is passed and available to the board the furlough should be treated as a situation justifying administrative leave or excused absence so that employees can be justly paid"], [0.966764509677887, 0.966764509677887,

throughout the nation affecting not only the shipment of freight but commuter and passenger operations and this situation has resulted from the inability of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and the railroads represented by the national railway labor conference to reach agreement after all peaceful means under the railway labor act have been exhausted the continuation of this rail strike will have a devastating impact upon the economy witnesses who testified before the energy and commerce committee yesterday confirmed that the strike is costing the american people approximately 80 million per day and should the strike continue will result in hundreds of thousands of nonrailroad employees becoming unemployed layoffs in the auto industry have already begun the steel industry will follow soon admittedly this remedy is a drastic step but this type of legislation is not unique there is ample precedent for congress to intervene where the public interest is at stake as it is here this nationwide rail strike was precipitated after failure of the parties the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and the national railway labor conference to settle their differences through the collective bargaining process even after consideration of the recommendations of presidential emergency board no 194 negotiations have gone on for 18 months on a labor contract the parties are at an impasse the one unresolved issue between the brotherhood of railway engineers and the national railway labor conference that resulted in the ble action relates to the wage differential between the engineers repre sented by ble and other train crew members represented by the united transportation union utu as the washington post correctly pointed out in this mornings editorial this is essentially a jurisdictional dispute the utu testified yesterday it was not opposed to this legislation i am concerned as i believe all members should be with the impact that any resolution to the present strike will have upon the tentative agreement that was worked out between the nrlc and the utu further delay could jeopardize that argeement according to the testimony yesterday by fred hardin the president of the utu i believe that secretary lewis quite appropriately indicatedthat the president based upon a careful weighting of the countervailing considerations made a judgment call to recommend the specific approach set forth in senate joint resolution 250 i believe it is the proper judgment call therefore i urge my colleagues to support senate joint resoultion 250 and oppose the amendment to be offered by the gentleman from new jersey the washington post editorial follows locomotive economics the brotherhood of locomotive engineers is providing the reagan administration with a small but useful lesson in the realities of labor economics the engineers strike is not really against management but against other unions whose members have won supplemental pay in a deal to reduce the size of train crews the engineers position is a simple one they have always been the bestpaid men on the train by a certain differential hallowed by tradition with clenched teeth and white knuckles they declare that they want their differential and they are prepared to keep their industryand many othersshut down until they are assured of it when mr reagan came to office he made it clear that he intended to keep his administration out of labor negotiations the general thought was that the free market was to operate unimpeded in labor as in everything else some of the administrations economists felt that unions would see the tight restraint of the money supply expressed in the weekly figures for m1 and perceive that the day of the inflationary wage increase was over other economists thought that unions probably would not moderate wage demands until unemployment began to rise but then surely wages would hold to the noninflationary trend as things are working out it seems that the locomotive engineers have not been following m1 as carefully as they were supposed to certainly they have not taken its austere message to heart that will be a deep disappointment to the economists of the rationalexpectations school there seems to have been a collision between rational expectations and the engineers expectations nor has the thought of unemployment deterred the strike the country is now in the 15th month of a severe recession and the unemployment rate is nearly 10 percent in railroading the number of jobs has been falling for a generation but the engineers want their differential sometimes in a situation like this a unions leadership understands perfectly well that a large raise is out of the question but the members not all of whom follow economic policy closely do not necessarily understand it they pursue their traditions and traditions are slow to bend thats why throughout the national economy as a whole wages are still rising at an average rate of about 7 percent a year thats why president reagan was right to rise above principle as the late sen everett dirksen used to say and intervene in the engineers strike and thats why congress

acquiring an additional lease until they have achieved both commercial production and are within 15 years of exhausting the recoverable resource on the existing lease the bill includes two provisions aimed at conservation of the resource the first provision allows the secretary of the interior to lease minerals that are comingled with oil shale provided they cannot otherwise be mined economically second there exists a provision to allow for maximum recovery by leasing small tracts which would be bypassed as unecoiomic by themselves the bill solves the problem of disposing shale after the oil has been extracted by providing noncontiguous offsite leases for this purpose no oil shale development may occur on these tracts and they are available only to federal lessees h r 4053 assures the

20 in the other body what the bill does is to say to our trading partners yes you can continue to have access to the enormous united states market in automobiles but if you take advantage of that market you have to make a certain percentage of your product in the united states it provides a schedule of penalties for any company that fails to meet those standards that are geared precisely to the domestic content requirement so that to the degree by which they fail to meet the domestic content requirements they will have a penalty against their permissible imports i think that this is modest and totally justified legislation what we have seen in the united states for some time is our trading partners taking unconscionable advantage of us we have seen that particularly with respect to japan taking over our electronics industry which we developed taking over our markets in televisions steel radios recorders and photographic equipment and many other products now in automobiles the japanese have more than 23 percent of our market total imports are better than 30 percent of our market with all the best of intentions our trade negotiators not only under this administration but under previous administrations have failed to stem this flow and our efforts in congress to try to stem this flow have been of no avail this came about historically in a very understandable way after world war ii we wanted to help build up europe and japan so in addition to helping them with the marshall plan we were very lenient with respect to our trade relations with them and we lowered our barriers far below the point at which they have lowered their barriers today japan and the common market have achieved economic parity with us but our trade imbalances have not been rectified as we have now entered into hard times we find both europe and japan actually increasing their barriers against the united states and the answer that we hear from the opponents of this bill is that we ought to be the champions of free trade and we ought not to take any meaningful action so in effect we have been acting like tncle sucker we have seen our entire industrial base eroded and we have done

vote on representative findleys administration bill to repeal the final adjustment of the dairy price support the most obviouq and compelling reason to reject this proposal is that it is a callous breach of faith with americas dairy farmers 4 years ago we voted in favor of passage of the 1977 farm bill among other things this legislation mandated the continuation of a successful government program which maintained stability in the market for a commodity precious to millions of americans milk the milk price support program should be looked at in an historical context in the early 1970s president nixon attacked the program publicly and held down prices while allowing increased imports consequently an average of 20 000 dairy operations per year went out of business for 3 consecutive years milk production dropped and what followed was the sharpest increase in dairy prices ever experienced by consumers it should be noted that in the years that the present 80 percent of parity support price has been in effect the increase in the cost of dairy products has gone up at an average rate of 12 percent less than the price rise of all other foods thus the consumer has benefited greatly from the stability this program has there is no question that we must make some effort to reduce the government stocks of dairy products on hand there is no disagreement on the issue itself but rather on the method by which it is done perhaps as important as revising the price support mechanism is the question of changing the commodity credit corporations ccc sellback policy currently the ccc buys up milk and dairy products stores these commodities and then sells the stores back to processors at 105 percent of the current purchase price obviously with interest rates over 15 percent processors have no incentive to retain inventories instead they use the ccc as their reserve and months later buy back stocks at what amounts to a mere 5 percent increase or loan nor does the processor pay any of the warehousing costs in essence the taxpayers subsidize the storage costs which figure large into the usdas dairy program and pay the added interest rate as well the sellback price should be raised this would reduce the cost of the program milk productionand overproductionis clearly related to the price of grain and feed during the past 2 yearsuntil just recentlygrain prices were very low more cows were kept because feed was cheap milk prices were steady and beef prices were also quite low the result overproduction now with grain prices somewhat higher some dairy cows are being culled out and sold this will reduce production and help bring it into line with demand i realize that farmers constitute only 2 8 percent of the nations populace and an even smaller percentage is involved in dairy farming for this reason i submit that the dairy vote has become a symbolic rather than a substantive one the record will demonstrate that i have always been in favor of cutting the costs of government and balancing the federal budget but it will also show that i have treated proposed reductions on a casebycase basis i urge my colleagues then to cast their votes on this question in a manner consistent with fairness to the dairy farmer i came really prepared to make a different speech but i want to address one point that has been repeatedly raised on the minority side today and on occasion from our side and that is that we must not we will not and we shall not ask the dairy farmer to stand alone that all are going to bear this equally this sounds remarkably like the rhetoric of the carter administration when they put on the embargo that the farmer would not bear this burden alone we should all bear it equally let me suggest to my friends on this side of the aisle there is no intention of this administration to ask everybody to bear the cost equally we have been recently for example in another committee at work on an investigation of the energy department and the investigation within the energy department of the special counsels office the proposal of this administration is to trip that office of 80 percunt of its resources this will mean that essentially the 7 billion additional that the american consumer bore because they were overcharged by the oil companies during the price regulated period will go essentially unchallenged the oil companies have already started backing out of tentative agreements to settle out of court now there is no intention of this secretary of energy to bear that cost equally so when we say here today that we are going to insist that all bear it equally i am going to challenge the members of this side of the aisle to join with us when we give them a chance to make good on their commitment today that all shall bear the cost equally of the reagan program because they are not geared to do that if my friend from illinois my friend from minnesota and others join us when we come in on that particular issue

tremendous amount of work that he has done on this issue from the very beginning i remember at the earliest stages of the consideration of the upcoming budget that he circularized a dear colleague letter to all of us in which he outlined in detail exactly the areas in which these tax expenditures could be cut back without doing any harm at all to the body politic and indeed make it a more democratic society for all of us with his having done that so early and with such detail and precision as to why in fact it was not found acceptable in the consideration of the budget to include some of those very provisions so that in fact the american people could feel that this congress considered not just the defenseless in the budget cutbacks but also those who can more than adequately take care of themselves i wonder what the gentlemans experience was as he attempted to impose these cutbacks in tax expenditures"], [0.0022295117378234863, 0.5022295117378235, 1, "the recent act of

human being individuals who take to the well to advocate the right to bear arms a questionable right indeed would be well advised to reexamine their priorities i think that a human life is far more important and that life is far more sacred than the right of a citizen to carry a handgun and granting for the sake of discussion that there is a right to bear arms that right is bestowed by society and this body when confronted by two conflicting rights can only choose the higherthe right to lifeand move to protect that right by enacting legislation that would stem the flow of handguns it seems to me that we must control the instruments of violence that are so readily accessible to those among us who have no respect for life i think that now is the time to confront the issue of violence and to control the handguns which are too easily available"], [0.003679513931274414, 0.5036795139312744, 1, "mr not forced to live with the mess they speaker i intend to vote with the gen make of our

legislation deserve a good deal of credit for moving this bill to the floor with all deliberate speed we should now extend that good work and get this bill adopted and over to the senate and on to conference i have some misgivings about portions of this legislation i am sure that all members do however the bottom line is this the legislation is sound the need for it is immense and the time to act is now we have before us a bill that does what it should this legislation meets a real need both in terms of the jobs it will create and the improvements that will be made in our highways and bridges this legislation also provides the means to meet that need by providing for the additional revenue necessary it has been our habit around here to be quick to meet needs but reluctant to provide the means that is how we dug ourselves into the recession this time we are putting the house to the test you cannot reap the rewards of this legislation without paying the price we are backing up our political inclinations to build roads and create jobs with the tax revenues with which to do it this bill gives you the opportunity to be fiscally responsible while you are politically responsive that combination is the only one that will help us dig our way out of the recession i suspect that before this congress ends we will be offered the temptation to revert back to the golden days of buy now pay later politics the siren sounds of makework jobs are already filling our cars the vote will be very easy to cast there is nothing like creating millions of mythical jobs without providing for one dime in taxes to pay for them this legislation on the other hand may be a tough vote politically as it will be for me but it is the only responsible way out as i mentioned there are provisions of this bill that are not appealing to me the authorization is extended for too long a period and we are making some changes in highway programs that are not necessary or desirable there is too much provided for the operation of mass transit systems however when i look at my own state of illinois i know all too well the very immediate need there for repair and maintenance of our transportation network and the very criticalneed for the 26 000 jobs it will create there i hope some of the gliches can be worked out in conference and no additional unacceptable items added before we vote on final passage this legislation will provide 5 5 billion and create 170 000 construction jobs and nearly as many more in other fields the problem is obvious to anyone who travels on our nations highways we have got 4 000 miles of interstate in need of resurfacing half of the total system will need major work in the next 15 years 50 percent of our primary highways will need work in this decade and 40 percent of all our bridges are reaching the end of their lifespan in this decade this financing mechanism will allow us to finish the interstate system in the next 10 years meet most of our critical repair needs and rehabilitate all of those bridges now classified as structurally weak or too narrow for present day traffic these funds will be distributed through existing highway programs so that the effect can be felt this spring there will be no long delays while we create new bureaucracies and mountains of new regulations and that is the real key to this program having an immediate impact on the economy that will be positive for those out of work this legislation has been criticized because it does not do enough to resolve our unemployment problems it is true that 320 000 jobs do not put a very large dent in unemployment of 12 million but part of our failure to meet recessionary jobs needs in the past has been our penchant for massive programs that hold out the hope of the ultimate solution and do nothing more than bring on another round of inflation meeting the unemployment problem means attacking it on many fronts not just one this is but one frontal attack there are a number of other innovative and fiscally responsible ways to address unemployment and i hope the new congress will put them at the top of the priority list i hope we will not be so irresponsible as to try to solve the entire problem with one grandiose sweep of our magic wand i urge my colleagues to take this major step and enact this legislation"], [0.0037987828254699707,

twiceayear costofliving adjustment for retired federal employees under the age of 65 this outcry of distress is coming from elderly citizens who have suddenly realized that their wellthoughtout plans for retirement have the potential of being marred it is not that they object to making their contribution to society it is that they have already contributed greatly up to this point had have looked forward to the day when they could relax comfortably and enjoy the fruits of their accomplishments in other word1s the safety net of programs of which the president spoke in his statement of february 18 should certainly extend to the pension benefits earned by retired civil servants there are several reasons why many believe a change in the cola would be unfair and unjust first of all some federal employees are placed on mandatory retirement plans where they have to retire before the age of 65 for example special agents of the fbi are required to retire at the age of 55 air traffic controllers of which there are 17 000 are forced to retire at age 55 to name only two organizations affected is it fair to penalize these persons who would rather stay at their jobs until the age of 65 and also have a very difficult time in gaining further employment i would submit that this is not an equitable situation another factor that may not have been considered by the author of the reduction proposal is that for many persons one of the incentives to accept federal employment is the retirement benefit by making government jobs less attractive we will certainly lose some of our most competent individuals we must make the federal sector of employment competitive with the private sector in order to retain and encourage the most qualified people in the field to enter and to stay we must also consider the extensive hardship and disappointment that our elderly citizens may have to endure after having made future life plans around an income that had been promised them early in the stages of their careers at this late point in time they would be told to alter these plans that what they had counted on and had expected to secure them in a supposedly nonhectic peaceful time of life can no longer be relied upon they have already gone through the stage in life where one scrimps and saves do they deserve to go through that again not at this point in life please let us not break a promise that has already been made it is a moral obligation that should be binding on all of us mr speaker i am not exaggerating these claims this is the way it has been presented to me by concerned and upset citizens let us not alter or upset the lives of those who have already contributed to society and who have previously been secure in the knowledge that the future they have made for themselves will

states to operate programs aimed at reducing drunk driving and instructs the transportation department to establish a computerized national driver registration program to aid states in locating potential problem drivers this piece of legislation represents a strong meaningful commitment from congress to combat the problem of intoxicated drivers on our nations roads when we speak of alcoholrelated traffic accidents we are not just talking about traffic accidents we are talking about crime and statistics show that drunk driving is the most frequently committed violent crime in the united states today last year alone 25 000 people were killed in alcoholrelated crashes and more than 650 000 others suffered serious injuries the leading cause of teen deaths are traffic accidents and most of these are alcohol related the fact is approximately 70 american citizens are killed daily in alcoholrelated crashes yet only 1 out of every 2 000 drunk drivers are caught these statistics are intolerable but statistics do not begin to tell the story the tragedy of a single drunkdriving accident i would like to conclude these brief remarks by submitting to the record an editorial which was written by one of my constituents in connecticut about his experience with a drunk driver perhaps this personal account can best convey the personal trauma of alcoholrelated accidents and the need for explicit farreaching remedies last saturday evening after a pleasant vacation dinner my girlfriend and i came close to becoming another statistic in the long list of deaths associated with drunk driving we were fortunate suffering only concussions cuts and bruises however with a slight change in circumstances we would now be dead waiting to make a lefthand turn i was at a complete stop with my signal light on as i waited for the oncoming traffic to clear i noticed headlights advancing toward me in the wrong lanemy lane something was terribly wrong the collision which i dont remember occurred only seconds later paramedics were in the car checking the extent of our injuies when i awoke as i opened my eyes i saw that we were face to face with another cara car which had driven head on into ours its driver was drunk a car is a safe and convenient means of transportation when used responsibly when used irresponsibly it becomes a weapon with more killing power than a gun a drunk driver is a weapon on the road capable of snuffing out innocent life in a split second my experience showed me that life is indeed both a precious and a fragile gift a driver must always remember how easily he can destroy a life if he is drunk and out of control i realize that although this letter may be persuasive to some only strict laws with mandatory enforcement will persuade others it is the duty of all citizens who feel indignation concerning this and countless similar incidents to lobby for the passage of sensible laws before more innocents are killed"], [0.004460930824279785,

grain on the markets if they are in dire need of cash in my opinion this could precipitate the kind of grainmarket debacle that these government programs were designed to prevent so we must have action to pass this supplemental request in the quickest possible time i have taken part in the hearings on this matter hearings held expeditiously as soon as could be arranged after the resumption of

widespread notion that most americans do not have to worry about having any farmers and about their disastrous economic plight as long as we have plenty of supermarkets i am telling the house that an economic depression so severe and so dangerous that i cannot remember anything comparable is gripping our foodproducing sector and while it sounds good right now in terms of helping hold down food prices continued low prices to farmers for their products cannot long continue to subsidize the american consumer without grave consequences this bill providing 5 billion of additional financing for all farm programs must go through immediately or else the farm sectors already crashing economy will quite simply collapse discussions as we have here today by themselves tend to depress grain prices

senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations i say that this is not the proper forum in which to contemplate serious limitations on the use of ccc funds risking delay in approval of this desperately needed money this is not the forum to make a decision on tying the presidents hands on foreign policy therefore i have recommended to my committee and i suggest now that one appropriate
