still deeply concerns me that there are members of this body that have been constantly misinforming the public about prewar intel ligence on iraq and demanding timetables for troop withdrawal they seem to bq wholly unaware of the dire consequences of even talking about pulling our troops out let alone demanding it our brave men and women in uniform have always fought desperately to preserve those unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness endowed by the creator himself and that is exactly what they are doing now in iraq and we should all be deeply grateful for that one of the things that i am so desperately worried about is whether the people in this body and in this republic truly understand what we are facing not only as a nation but as western civilization the question we must ask ourselves is not whether we can win this war we must win this war the question now is what will happen if we do not i am so concerned that this nation does not yet understand that we are at war with an ideology an ideology that threatens the existence of the free world this war did not begin on 9 11 this war began many years ago when certain muslim extremists embraced a divergent islamist dogma that dictates that all infidels must die our nation was first attacked during its very early beginnings in the late 1700s by the barbary terrorists of the day more recently we were attacked in 1979 in iran our embassy and our marine barracks were attacked in beirut in 1983 the first world trade cen ter attack was in 1993 and we still did not wake up to what was happening at the time our military complexes and soldiers have been targeted throughout the world the khobar towers in saudi arabia in 1996 our embassies were blown up in kenya and tanzania in 1998 we witnessed the attack on the uss cole in 2000 1 year later on september 11 terrorists murdered nearly 3 000 american civilians on our own soil and i wonder tonight have we forgotten that since then our soldiers and our contractors have been kidnapped and executed their bodies mutilated and dragged through the streets and we are not alone this has taken place throughout the h11028 cc world in serbia and bosnia soldiers pows and civilians were beheaded by mujahideen in beslan russia 186 children and 158 teachers and parents were slaughtered in a terrorist assault against a grade school and just weeks ago in indonesia three young girls on their way to school were attacked and beheaded by muslim extremists their names their names were theresia ida and alfrita churches are being attacked pastors have been kidnapped tortured and beheaded and it seems there is not a day that goes by without a suicide or a car bomb attack in iraq we have witnessed the horrific bombings in spain london indonesia jordan and israel rioters have completely disrupted hundreds of cities in france we simply cannot deny that we are fighting a war against enemies with an evil ideology that is bent on the destruction of the western world they are committed to killing us and any others that hold in their mind to be infidels we truly are at war and to undermine the sacrifice and bloodbought advancement of our valiant american soldiers who are at this very moment fighting terrorists in iraq and across the world is unconscionable a nation divided against itself simply cannot stand and those of us in this body along with all americans must unite against this evil we must win the war in iraq we must give our troops unequivocal support and everything else in our power to help them finish this job our troops have never failed us andwe must not fail them if freedom is to survive to allow islamist terrorists to declare war and victory in iraq is not an option we must win and we cannot leave before the job is done because if we leave too soon we will not be able to go on with our daily lives as we once did because the world has truly changed and those without conscience are relentlessly seeking

rise in opposition to this rule and the underlying budget conference agreement more than a month ago the house passed a concurrent budget resolution that left average americans out in the cold the budget slashed domestic programs for education health care and veterans health benefits in order to make room for more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans i voted against it because i thought it left out the needs of the middle class and working families and would hurt my constituents in my hometown of sacramento today we are considering the conference agreement to that budget which has been negotiated in secret over the past several weeks and rushed to the floor without time for members to even read through it but it appears that these several weeks have not yielded many improvements the cuts to the most vulnerable are still there the cuts to education are still there and it still favors big oil companies at the expense of our natural treasures by allowing drilling in anwr more fundamentally this is a budget agreement without courage during president clintons administration congress took up the hard work involved in weighing our nations competing priorities and it meant that we were able to create a social security surplus for future generations in a very responsible manner but it has been just the opposite under this republican majority they are spending every dollar of the social security surplus in order to finance their april 28 2005 cc deficits and their tax breaks for the wealthiest of americans just as irresponsibly this budget is trying to hide the presidents plan to privatize social security the president wants to divert social security payroll taxes out of the social security system and into private accounts replacing a guaranteed benefit with the risks of wall street is bad public policy it would mean an average benefit reduction of 152 000 it is not surprising that the american people have rejected it we should be strengthening social securitys fundamental commitment made from one generation to another instead of weakening it conveniently the budget agreement before us ducks responsibility for this reckless plan we know that privatizing social security would require borrowing 2 trillion over the next 10 years debt borrowed against our children and our grandchildren not surprisingly this inconvenient reality is left out of the conference report the budget is our federal governments statement of priorities crafting it involves tough choices among many competing and worthwhile programs nonetheless democratic priorities are clear making health care more affordable strengthening social security investing in our local communities i do not believe this budget has these priorities in mind and i urge my colleagues to vote

homeland security all this kind of stuff but when it comes down to the printed word when it comes down to the budget that is handed out from the white house and when it comes down to what this republican majority does it is 2 000 from what the 911 commission called for and what we called for as house democrats versus the presidents proposal and you can look it up on line that only asks for 210 agents democrats fought for the funding on almost five different occasions again for the record ms wasserman schultz h r 1268 a motion to recommit and 2 000 vote number 160 and that happened on 5 5 05 also you look at house bill 2360 was blocked it was an obey amendment vote number 174 that was on 5 17 05 it failed 223 to 185 on a partisan vote h r 1817 a motion to recommit 2005 again vote number 188 again failed on partisan lines you start talking about on border security and closing the gaps on nine separate occasions over the last 5 years democrats put forth motions here on this floor because that is the only thing we can do being in the minority we are not able to bring the bills to the floor because the majority is blocking those bills from getting out of committee and they are noted right here and i am not going to go through that at this particular time but all of this is on line housedemocrats gov if anyone wants to go on and get this information also when you start talking about aviation security democrats offered a motion to require air cargo to be screened within 3 years the motion was rejected by republicans again 2005 vote number 188 5 18 05 democrats have spoken repeatedly on the issue of transit security making sure that we authorize including a 2 8 billion initiative to improve transit security and a 1 billion initiative to improve rail security

i wish the rubber stamp republican majority would stop fighting us and start saying to the president guess what we no longer want to rubber stamp everything that you send here i just wish the republican majority would just leader up and say hey mr president so you start reading the paper could someoneget me a newspaper please because i want to just have it as a prop because as americans start reading the paper they are reading about how republican members of the house and the senate the president flies into town they get on the plane and leave town some even get in their car and go i was on the other side of my district well let me tell you something if the president of the united states is in my district i think i would know i think it would be some sort of news flash or some sort of email that would come to me and say you know the president is coming in your district today will be in an elementary school maybe you want to be there he is the leader of the free world maybe you want to be there the reason why they are taking flights while the president is coming in the reason why they are finding something else to do while the president is in their town is the fact that they dont want to be caught in the same situation with the president of the united states because they have not stood up to the president and said no you cant put us in a financial situation as far as the eye can see as it relates to deficits and foreign countries running the world you cant pick up the paper today not talking about a republican running from the president of the united september 12 2006 co states and dont want to be around when the president is around or explaining why they are not there that is some excuse i hope i never get to the situation where i have the president of the united states coming into my district and i have to explain that i am somewhere else while the president is there and the bottom line is this people cannot face the music when it comes down to dealing with the policies of this administration and better yet you being in the position there is only 535 of us being in the position as i come in for a landing ms wasserman schultz to be able to bring about change on behalf of the american people to say this is not going to happen to say i know you want to start a war in iraq but we still got this business over here with al qaeda who had everything to do with 9 11 who trained the individuals that carried out the 9 11 plot but meanwhile while we are over therelooking for osama bin laden and we have him cornered i got this unfinished business the president said over here in iraq because i got a problem with this leader over here we got to take him out but what about the after player what is going to happen once you get to baghdad how are you going to bring stability who is going to be in the coalition calling up a couple of friends ill send 25 troops ill send 30 troops you are not allowed to talk about it everything is secret we have the then sitting attorney general comes to the unitedstates congress over on the senate side and tells the senate you are either with us or you are with the terrorists 0l 2340 what kind of mess is that so when it comes down to article i section 1 and if the american people want the kind of representation they need i am not talking as a democrat even though we were given an hour by the deqiocratic leader and we are all members of the democratic caucus this is america i guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot ms wasserman schultz i cannot help but imagine the kind of chaos and protest and finger pointing and them and they and all of the things that will be said some of the stuff will have to be stricken from the record because the republican side will be carrying on about the democrats but they cannot say it they cant do it they cannot even kind of paint a picture because they have been in charge of the whole thing since it started so if the american people want a new direction if the american people want accountability if the american people want a house and a senate that will carry out article i section 1 of the unitedstates constitution and a lot of blood is on this constitution but if they want that then they will vote for a new direction in november i am done ladies and gentlemen with begging the republican majority to stand up on behalf of the american people because i am looking at what the oil companies are getting they are getting theirs i am looking at what these contractors are getting either it be katrina or the war in iraq they are getting theirs i am looking at the issue of health care and all of the people that are running to the bank with all of the dollars and all of the influence and all of the access into this congress they are getting theirs meanwhile we are sitting around here talking about the minimum wage and we cant even get a doggone bill passed off this floor to be able to provide the american people with a minimum wage meanwhile we are giving ourselves a nice fat pay raise every year 4 100 here 3 100 there oh we have the money for that but we dont have the money for the people who are punching in and punching out every day this has to come to an end and that is the reason why ms wasserman schultz that i believe there is a wind of change it may not be outside the hall of this chamber but it is out there in

for the wealthy when the nation is at war and the national debt is over 8 trillion indeed i think it is unconscionable to be considering voting another tax cut to the wealthiest 0 3 percent of americans the joint committee on taxation estimates that this estate tax proposal will cost the federal government 602 billion plus an extra 160 billion when interest is accounted for only 0 5 percent of the richest families in america currently pay estate taxes moreover under current law in 2009 only 3 out of every 1 000 estates will pay a penny in estate taxesall couples with estates up to 7 million 99 7 percent will pass on their entire estates taxfree any compromise proposal which deviates from 2009 current lawsuch as h r 5638is therefore crafted entirely to benefit this tiny sliver of the richest estates american voters stand strongly against drastic estate tax legislation according to recent polling data nearly 60 percent of voters hold the initial unaided view that estate tax should be left as is or reformed and only 23 percent support repeal when asked about the estate tax in the context of other budget priorities voters rank repealing the estate tax as the last priority and 55 percent of voters oppose repeal this socalled compromise nearly as regressive and costly as a full repeal is no compromise at all passing even this compromise legislation would constitute one of the most regressive tax cuts in the history of the united states middle and lowerclass americans will be forced to shoulder the burden of radically decreasing the estate taxboth monetarily and through decreased public programs in order to cover the monetary gap the government will plunge further into debt which will limit its ability to address the social security solvency gap and reduce the money available for public programs it will also have to tap other tax sources like payroll taxes which will overwhelmingly hinder lowerincome families i urge my colleagues to uphold the core american values of fairness and belief in meritocracy by rejecting this tax cut if we really wish to help the most deserving american families we should raise the minimum wage from 5 15 to 7 25 over 3 years did you know that todays minimum wage of 5 15 today is the equivalent of only 4 23 in 1995 which is even lower than the 4 25 minimum wage level before the 199697 increase it is scandalous that a person can work fulltime 40 hours per week for 52 weeks earning the minimum wage would gross just 10 700 which is well below the poverty line a minimum wage increase would raise the wages of millions of workers an estimated 7 3 million workers 5 8 percent of the workforce would receive an increase in their hourly wage rate if the minimum wage was raised from 5 15 to 7 25 by june 2007 due to spillover effects the 8 2 milli6n workers 6 5 percent of the workforce earning up to 1 00 above the minimum would also be likely to benefit from an increase raising the minimum viage will benefit working families the earnings of minimum wage workers are crucial to their families wellbeing evidence from the 199697 minimum wage increase shows that the average minimum wage worker brings home more than half 54 percent of his or her familys weekly earnings an estimated 760 000 single mothers with children under 18 would benefit from a minimum wage increase to 7 25 by june 2007 single mothers would benefit disproportionately from an increasesingle mothers are 10 4 percent of workers affected by an increase but they make up only 5 3 percent of the overall workforce approximately 1 8 million parents with children under 18 would benefit contrary to popular myths and urban legends adults make up the largest share of workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase seventytwo percent of workers whose wages would be raised by a minimum wage increase to 7 25 by june 2007 are adults age 20 or older close to half 43 9 percent of workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase work full time and another third 34 5 percent work between 20 and 34 hours per week minimum wage increases benefit disadvantaged workers and women are the largest group of beneficiaries from a minimum wage increase 60 6 percent of workers who would benefit from an increase to 7 25 by 2007 are women an estimated 7 3 percent of working women would benefit directly from that increase in the minimum wage a disproportionate share of minorities would benefit from a minimum wage increase african americans represent 11 1 percent of the total workforce but are 15 3 percent of workers affected by an increase similarly 13 4 percent of the total workforce is hispanic but hispanics are 19 7 percent of workers affected by an increase the benefits of the increase disproportionately help those working households at the bottom of the income scale although households in the bottom 20 percent received only 5 1 percent of national income 38 1 percent of the benefits of a minimum wage increase to 7 25 would go to these workers the majority of the benefits 58 5 percent of an increase would go to families with working primeaged adults in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution among families with children and a lowwage worker affected by a minimum wage increase to 7 25 the affected worker contributes on average half of the familys earnings thirtysix percent of such workers actually contribute 100 percent of their familys earnings a minimum wage increase would help reverse the trend of declining real wages for lowwage workers between 1979 and 1989 the minimum wage lost 31 percent of its real value by contrast between 1989 and 1997 the year of the most recent increase the minimum wage was raised four times and recovered about onethird of the value it lost in the 1980s income inequality has been increasing in part because of the declining real value of the minimumwage today the minimum wage is 33 percent of the average hourly wage of american workers the lowest level since 1949 a minimum wage increase is part of a broad strategy to end poverty as welfare reform forces more poor families to rely on their eamings from lowpaying jobs a minimum wage increase is likely to have a greater impact on reducing poverty the opponents of the minimum wage often claim that increasing the wage will cost jobs and harm the economy of course there is no credible study to support such claims in fact a 1998 epi study failed to find any systematic significant job loss associated with the 199697 minimum wage increase the truth is that following the most recent increase in the minimum wage in 199697 the lowwage labor market performed better than it had in decades and after the minimum wage was increased the country went on to enjoy the most sustained period of economic prosperity in history we had historic low levels of unemployment rates increased average houriy wages increased family income and decreased poverty rates studies have shown that the best performing small businesses are located in states with the highest minimum wages between 1998 and 2004 the job growth for small businesses in states with a minimum wage higher than the federal level was 6 2 percent compared to a 4 1 percent growth in states where the federal level prevailed so much for the discredited notion that aising the minimum wage harms the economy it does not but it increases the purchasing power of those who most need the money which is far more than can be said of the republicans devotion to cutting taxes for multimillionaires americans overwhelmingly side with progressive principles of rewarding hard work with a living wage in a recent poll conducted by the pew research center 86 percent of americans favored raising the minimum wage in the 2004 election voters in florida and nevada two states won by president bush overwhelmingly approved ballot measures to raise the minimum wage even in nevadas richest county 61 5 percent of douglas where bush received 63 5 percent of the vote voters supported raising the minimum wage fortythree percent of americans consider raising the minimum wage to be a top priority in contrast only 34 percent considered making the recent federal income tax cuts permanent and only 27 percent consider the passage of a constitutional amendment to ban samesex marriage as top priorities members of congress have legislated a minimum salary for themselves and have seen fit to raise it eight times since they last raised the minimum wage it is time we gave the americans we represent a longoverdue pay raise by increasing the minimum wage to 7 25 over 3 years even this amount does not keep pace with the cost of living the minimum wage would have to be increased to 9 05 to equal the purchasing power it had in 1968 and if the minimum wage had increased at the same rate as the salary increase corporate ceos have received it would now be 23 03 per hour"], [0.001240849494934082, 0.9987591505050659, 1, "this evening as i do

members of the fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition because you will find this poster as a welcome mat by each door of a blue dog member as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 419 147 820 878 and some change your share of the national debt that is every living man woman and child including the children born today every american citizens share of the national debt is 28 134 as members of the blue dog coalition it is what we call the debt tax debt and that is one tax that cannot go away until this republican congress and this administration gets our nations fiscal house in order last week the president made a big announcement about how the deficit really was not as bad as what his white house had first thought and reported it would be i think the best way to sum up the events of last week can be found in an editorial july 11 2006 from the los angeles times entitled another mission accomplished and i will not read the entire editorial but i think it sets the stage for what we plan the spend the next hour discussing this evening it starts off like this the release of the white house midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets not by a fulldressed presidential dogandpony show but president bush plans to preside today with members of congress and invited guests in attendance by all indications including his own in his weekly radio address last saturday he plans to turn this into a celebration just in time for the fall campaign the editorial from the los angeles times dated july 11 2006 continues this is proof if anyone still needs it that this administration is desperate for something to boast about on mr bushs watch tripledigit budget surpluses have turned into annual tripledigit budget deficits there is no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly dispiriting fact yes the report is expected to project that this years deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last years probably somewhere between 280 and 300 billion versus a 318 billion shortfall in 2005 and it concludes that part of the editorial by saying that is not much to crow about well they are right last week the administration released its midsession review of the budget and after further examination lets take a closer look at what the report actually tells us the report actually tells us that what we have here is another record deficit the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit makes 2006 one of the four largest deficits in our nations history it is hard now to believe that we had a balanced budget in this country from 1998 to 2001 but it did not take this administration and this republicanled congress very long to turn fiscal responsibility into record deficits i 2000 as you can see the largest deficit ever in our nations history occurred in 2004 when the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was 413 billion in red ink in hot checks if you will the year 2003 was the second largest deficit ever in our nations history where for the first time in over 50 years the republicans controlled the white house the house and senate and they gave us the second largest deficit ever in our nations history 378 billion the third largest record deficit ever in our nations history again occurred while the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was in 2005 and it was 318 billion deficit the third largest deficit ever in our nations history then this year the president has a press conference has a grand ceremony and event to announce that the deficit for fiscal year 2006 is only 296 billion the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history i think the editorial in the los angeles times had it right when it said that is not much to crow about the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit as i indicated makes 2006 the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history while this number represents an improvement over the 2005 deficit of 318 billion it still ranks as the fourthlargest deficit ever in our nations history these revised estimates do not account for the extent of our budget problems because they include in the calculation the annual surpluses in social security the first bill i filed as a member of congress when i got here in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund this republican congress refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why because they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund this outofcontrol deficit this outofcontrol debt this reckless spending that we are seeing occurring in our nations capital and the way the republican leadership is running our government and

republican administration this republican congress has given us the largest budget deficit ever in our nations history for 5 years in a row as blue dog democrats we are sick and tired of all the

making good progress paying down the debt and we had 4 years a row in balance and paying down but there is one very critical thing that happened in 2001 and that was that the paygo rules were suspended those rules were put in place by a bipartisan congress in 1997 and those paygo rules said that you had to pay for what you spent just like we have to do in our home budget and if you were to spend more money you had to either find a budget cut someplace or you had to find tax revenues to pay for it so for 4 years on a bipartisan agreement negotiated between newt gingrich and president clinton the country lived within its means then in the year 2001 those rules were suspended since that has happened we have amassed some of the biggest deficits in the history of our country all financed or virtually all financed unfortunately through deficit spending and that is being financed by foreign governments in fact our colleague john tanner is very often quoted as saying that we have borrowed more money from foreign governments in the last 5 years than in the rest of the history of the united states combined in fact he is also fond of saying that if we were going to have to go in if there was a war between china and taiwan and we went in to defend taiwan like our treaties obligate us to do we would have to borrow the money from china to defend taiwan against china that

for her outstanding leadership on thisissue it is high time to eradicate a sickening deficiency of the united nations its pathological persecution of one member the democratic state of israel whose performance and standards are vastly superior to those of most of its nondemocratic detractors over the years the united states has occasionally used diplomacy at the united nations to address this sickness especially during the tenure of our distinguished ambassadors daniel patrick moynihan and jeanne kirkpatrick recently a renewed spasm of antiisraeli activism has polluted critical united nations mechanisms such as the general assembly and the socalled commission on human rights one of the most disturbing experiences i personally have had during my service as a member of congress took place in august of 2001 when i was a member of the united states delegation to the united nations world conference against racism at durban solpth africa secretary general kofi annan was anxious to use this conference as an opportunity to reinvigorate the world community in the fight against racism bigotry discrimination and religious and ethnic intolerance but instead we witnessed the hijacking of the conference by those who turned it into a vile outpouring of antisemitism and antiisrael sentiment this conference was one of the most vicious antisemitic displays i have seen since i witnessed the holocaust in hungary in the 1940s the draft document presented to the conference included phrases such as the racist practices of zionism and where the holocaust had been cited as an example of racism taken to extremes arab and muslim states proposed replacing it with the term holocausts in the plural and lower case which was yet another manifestation of propaganda to deny and to diminish the unique character of the holocaust in which 6 million innocent human beings perished despite repeated efforts of the united states and some other delegations to work with the problematic countries at durban south africa the underlying antisemitism disguised as criticism of israel could not be resolved and it was my privilege to lead the walkout of the unitedstates delegation from that conference what could have been an important effort to revitalize the fight against racism and intolerance was turned into a lost opportunity it is time once and for all for our diplomats to apply themselves in a sustaindd manner to defeating the absurd series of antiisraeli resolutions that continue to crowd the agenda of the united nations pushing aside long overdue consideration of critical issues such as terrorism aids climate change poverty human rights abuses and famine our resolution takes note of the efforts of some u n member countries to delegitimize the state of israel by denying its opportunity to participate in u n organizations including the security council and the human rights commission it also notes that the united nations has been used to attack the state of israel for example of the emergency sessions of the general assembly that have been called six of the 10 were devoted solely to attacks against the state of israel our resolution commends recent examples of outstanding leadership in the fight against antisemitism i want to single out secretary general kofi annan who led the effort to call an unprecedented special session of the general assembly this past january to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz concentration camp during world war h at that special session kofi annan said the united nations must never forget that it was created as a response to the evil of nazism or that the horror of the holocaust helped to shape its mission that response is enshrined in our charter and in the universal declaration of human rights

of america today there are 148 do the math 184 is a smaller nutmber by 176 than 324 there are a lot of reasons for it but one of the reasons is this flow diagram to my left to the left we have all of the permits that are required for what is called new source review that is if they want to expand an existing refinery now this is actually the permitting application to expand an existing refinery in the state that i live in the state of texas in the new source review every one of thesesteps has to go forward on the right of the chart are additional permits in addition to the new source review this is not a madeup chart this is the law as it exists today what companys board of directors in their right minds would want to go through this process and tie up billions of dollars for years and years if they did not know that they would at least get a definite decision in a timely fashion tho bill before us may not be the best bill it may not be the only approach but it is a fact that we use 21 million barrels of oil a day in this country and we only have the refining capacity for about 16 on a good day and unfortunately since katrina and rita we have had many good days we are down to 14 million barrels of refinery capacity that is available and we need 21 million barrels of refinery capacity to refine our consumer demands that we have right now in this country so this bill before us today does not eliminate any of these requirements it does not lower the standard what it does do is require the environmental protection agency and the department of energy to appoint officials within their agencies to consolidate and to coordinate all of these reviews if if a state governor wants them to or if the president of the united states wants them to on federal property if a governor does not want it to expedite the review they do not have to and this stays in existence which means in those states they will not get any new or existing refineries built or expanded 1 0 1145 but in some states and i hope my state of texas is one i think governor perry wouldask for this expedited review if that happens and if we can get a company that wants to invest in a new refinery or expand an existing refinery you will actually get a decision in a timely fashion i have reason to believe that if we pass this bill and if the senate passes this bill within the next year you are going to see americas systems step forward and actually ask to build new refineries in the united states of america this is a good bill we should vote for it we should send it to the senate encourage them to vote for a similar bill and then go to conference and produce a conferenc6 report that the president can sign and let us get our country moving again and at least begin to start the process to lower gasoline prices for every american in this country in the days right after hurricane katrina gasoline prices shot up past the 3 dollar mark almost everywhere shortages caused some gasoline stations to run dry americans nationwide worried if the price would be higher on their way home from work than it was in the moming many consumers worried that they were getting gouged and wondered if prices would ever go down again today we take action today the house of representatives will support building new refineries improving gasoline markets and outlawing price gouging my committee was voting on the gasoline for americas security act just 4 weeks after hurricane katrina crossed the coast on that day 11 refineries remained closed by floodifig and power failures and most had no restart dates roughly 18 percent of all unitedstates gasoline production was still halted and prices everywhere had spiked as a consequence katrina damaged refineries all over louisiana and mississippi then hurricane rita came along and damaged refineries in louisiana and texas some have not restarted yet we were all surprised to learn what happens when a chunk of our domestic capacity goes off line every driver in america has endured shortages and price spikes that still have not fully subsided this bill encourages new refineries to increase supply we improve siting procedures provide regulatory risk insurance suggest nonpark federal lands for consideration and give refiners more certainty about the rules they have to live under our nation is more secure if refineries are spread more throughout the country this bill promotes new pipelines to get new crude oil and gasoline to consumers at lower prices we encourage those who might build the alaska natural gas pipeline to speed up by setting a deadline on their incentives we require a study of whether pipelines should have backup power capability so that they could operate during power outages the bill outlaws price gouging during emergencies for gasoline crude oil and home heating oil we leave in place state measures against price gouging we increase penalties to 11 000 per incident and expand the geographic scope of the provision i want to thank chairman cliff stearns of our commerce trade and consumer protection subcommittee and congressman greg walden for their help on this provision we promote conservation with a doe program to encourage carpooling and vanpooling we also require evaluation of using cmaq funds congestion mitigation and air quality for carpool and vanppol projects we can make it easier for americans to network and do these voluntary reductions of demand we authorize a refinery built for military use if the president determines that there is insufficient refining capacity the president can enter into contracts to permit construct and operate a refinery with private industry to manufacture refined products for the military this bill doesnt do everything i think it should do last night i agreed to drop very important new source review provisions that would give clarity to refiners and other energy providers an operator of a refinery a power plant or an industrial facility should not feel scared to conduct routine maintenance or modemize the system without hurting emissions a bipartisan majority of the energy corfimerce committee believes we should codify the administrations return to a sensible nsr policy those who want to delay these sensible reforms are taking a step back from increasing supplies of gasoline heating oil and other forms energy but i dont want this to get in the way of expanding refinery capacity after hurricane katrina so i will set it aside for now until we can hold the additional hearings that some believe are needed we will have a vote in the future on this policy and when it passes our nations supply of both energy supply and common sense will expand but today we have a chance to strike a blow against high gasoline prices we can increase competition among refineries by seeing new ones built we let any retail gasoline provider know the federal government is watchingso dont gouge consumers in an emergency people everywhere expect us to do the right thing and theres been honest and candid debate about what constitutes the right thing according to some doing nothing is not only right but cheap and easy too the donothing plan is the one weve followed for decades i think the two killer hurricanes have weakened the will to continue doing nothing however i hope so our country needs more oil refineries because the people who work for a living need gasoline to get to work these are people who earn paychecks and buy groceries at the safeway and pay their bills including their taxes that means they use gasoline every day they need it and they need it at a price they can afford they arent activists and they dont contribute to campaigns or hire any lobbyists sometimes washington forgets about them but

effort it represents several years of work that will ensure the safety and soundness of the governmentsponsored entities helping working americans achieve the dream of homeownership unfortunately this rule has a potential to undercut the committees fine effort and may severely undermine critical gse reform the availability of affordable housing keeps our communities strong so wisely the committee bill includes a fund to build andpreserve affordable housing and i would add support these activities at no cost to the federal government unfortunately the managers amendment mars this fund by forcing nonprofit affordable housing groups to make a choice they can work to bring affordable housing to working families or they can register voters in the most nonpartisan of ways but they cannot do both not even to drive an elderly person to the polls over 60 national organizations many of them faithbased such as the unitedstates conference of catholic bishops the episcopal church the presbyterian church have come out opposing this provision these organizations represent the mainstream values of this nation and their efforts should not be hindered by rollbacks in these constitutionally protected rights i urge my colleagues to maintain the broadly supported language that came out of the committee on financial services by rejecting the rule and the managers amendment this rule also provides for consideration of another amendment worthy of a no vote i am referring to the measure by the gentleman from new jersey that would strike the bills conforming loan limit provision like many other metropolitan locations my constituents in sacramento facp escalating housing prices that are making it harder and harder for working families to achieve the dream of homeownership firefighters police officers the teachers in our schools they deserve to live in the same communities they work in increasing the conforming loan limit would bring fairness to the housing market by giving working families in more expensive parts of the country the same opportunity as everyone else to own their own home once again this commonsense provision was included in the bipartisan committee bill and so i urge my colleagues to reject the garrett amendment in closing i reiterate to my colleagues the importance of maintaining the bipartisan version of h r 1461 that came out of the committee vote no on this rule which will tar the affordable housing fund without giving the majority an opportunity to vote on it"], [0.0013682246208190918, 0.4986317753791809, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume obviously i would like to thank the rules committee publicly for allowing my amendment because i know there were probably 130 amendments and i know they had a tough job deciding which ones to allow to go forward in short my amendment requires our government to ensure that the applicant is not a known criminal or terrorist before granting them immigration benefits pretty simple but as the current law now stands background checks of alien applicants are required but the law does not specifically require these security checks to be completed before these immigration benefits are actually handed out this means that many unworthy people have been able to receive these crucial benefits which then enables them to move freely throughout our country before their background checks are completely finished by the time we finally discover something questionable in their background of course it is too late to track them down we cannot find them i my amendment helps to close this loophole my amendment will prohibit the department of homeland security the attorney general and all courts from granting any kind of legal immigration status or benefits to an alien uxtil at a minimum the aliens name is first completely checked against a database of criminal records and terrorist watch lists using the treasury enforcement communication system database as it now stands all three have been giving status to aliens before they get their final results back from security checks the result is we are giving green cards citizenship work permits and temporary status to terrorists criminals and other unsavory types under this arrangement not always but sometimes for example a new study by janice kephart who was on the staff of the 9 11 commission looked at the immigration histories of 94 terrorists including six of the 9 11 hijackers who had operated on unitedstates soil between the 1990s and 2004 the results of this study are quite frightening twothirds that is 59 of the foreignborn terrorists studied committed immigration benefits fraud prior to or in conjunction with taking part in terrorist activity my amendment should go a long way towards preventing this irresponsible and dangerous loophole i urge my colleagues to support my amendment and the underlying bill i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0024580955505371094,

judiciary we do that because we dont trust them we dont trust them because of previous decisions and because of the simple fact that there are not five votes on the supreme court to protect our beloved pledge of allegiance and 80 percent to 90 percent of americans would like to leave the pledge of allegiance the way it is so what does this amendment do this amendment simply opens a big hole in the fence so the gentleman from iowa was absolutely right this is a gutting amendment there is absolutely no reason to pass the bill if this amendment were to pass we simply allow the supreme court to come in whenever they choose turn the first amendment upside down and simply say to kids you are not allowed to say the pledge of allegiance and we are going to use the first amendment from now on as a weapon instead of for free speech to censorship on the courts so i am not persuaded by the pious handwringing of liberal activists who flinch not at the courts unfettered march to create some imagined utopia at the expense of the separation of powers it is time for us to do our job as congressmen it is time to assert ourselves that we will not give unchecked legislative authority to the

and his devotion to duty even in the face of illness as a nation today we honor his memory and a lifetime of dedicated public service chief justice rehnquist was a man of great intellect and passion for the supreme court and its traditions who was an outstanding leader and administrator of the judiciary he was not only a student of history an author of books on american history but he also wrote chapters in our nations history as chief justice as a law clerk to a great justice robert jackson he formed an early appreciation for the institution that he would serve in a long and distinguished career as justice john paul stevens noted chief justice rehnquist set an exemplary example as leader of the court his colleagues uniformly spoke of his fair and impartial leadership of their proceedings and of his efforts to prevent disagreements from becoming personal his legacy is his steadfast and proud defense of an independent judiciary as justice ruth bader ginsburg said on sunday he regarded an independent judiciary as our countrys hallmark and pride and in his annual reports he constantly urged congress to safeguard that independence i hope all of us in congress will honor his legacy by preserving an independent judiciary it is our oath of office to protect and defend the constitution of the united statesand that means protecting an independent judiciary free of manipulation and intimidation as the new york times noted this morning chief justice rehnquist disapproved of recent congressional attempts to intimidate individual judges strip federal courts of jurisdiction to decide certain constitutional challenges and otherwise undermine the constitutional separation of powers and checks and balances in his last annual report the chief justice wrote that a judges judicial acts may not serve as a basis for impeachment any other rule would destroy judicial independence an independent judiciary has served for more than two centuries as the guardian of our constitutional liberties and as the words on the supreme court building so nobly state has ensured equal justice under law we must preserve an independent judiciary and honor his memory by doing

immigrants to this country though born and raised in louisiana i am very proud of their background certainly i think not only my parents but the interior indian american community is a great example of living the american dream and so many stories have been told and there are so many wonderful examples certainly we can talk in terms of numbers we can talk in terms of the iit graduates who are now doing so well in fortune 500 companies in this country certainly we can talk about the academic achievements we can talk about the contributions to our hightech industry in this country we can 1alk about the contributions in medicine in small business ownership and the numbers are phenomenal one of the most successful if not the most successful immigrant group but i do not think the numbers tell the entire story i think sometimes we have to look beyond the numbers and hear the personal stories my father for example is one of nine children the first one in his family and the only one to go to high school much less beyond high school i am certainly very proud of everything my father has accomplished in this country but it is not just my father i am very proud of all the different indian americans i have the privilege of meeting who have achieved so much in their respective fields and again i think a wonderful example of the american dream a wonderful example that in this country we do provide opportunity if one works hard and pursues that education i often tease my parents mark twain said that the older we become the smarter our fathers become the smarter our parents become and i tease my parents because now being the father of two children i appreciate more and more what my parents have sacrificed what they have endured and what they have accomplished i appreciate more the significance of the accomplishments of the indian american community some of those things we took for granted i did anyway growing up we did not really realize the significance of those struggles those sacrifices and how remarkable have been their collective and individual achievements again it is hard to exaggerate the indian american population numbers according to census numbers 11 2 million people in this country we are talking about the indians in america 87 percent have completed high school almost twothirds have at least some college education remarkable numbers remarkable contributions but again the numbers do not tell the entire story in my state indian american physicians serve some of the neediest areas allow emergency rooms to stay open provide primary care to those who would not otherwise have access to care the numbers are amazing 300 000 indian americans working in silicon valley 750 of those companies headed by people of indian american descent responsible for 15 percent of the hightech startups in the area again when we look at the numbers they tell an amazing story but it is not just the numbers again in my home state in my home district indian americans own businesses in the biggest cities to the smallest communities the most rural parts of my state employing thousands of my citizens of my constituents so again i think it is a wonderful success story i want to thank the gentleman from virginia chairman tom davis for highlighting through this resolution the accomplishments of the indian american people but i will just remind my colleagues two things in closing one it is my belief that the indian american success story is a great testimony to the strength of the american dream that the american dream is alive and well one of the reasons i was so passionate to become a member of this body was to nurture that dream for our children to make sure that all of our children continue to have the same opportunities that brought my parents and others like them here in the first place and secondly to say it is not just the numbers it is not just the it graduates it is not just the hightech startups it is not just the educational achievement it is also the personal stories stories like my dads and others like him who have not only done so well but have given so their kids and others around them might have a better

hours of our innovation agenda that we have the innovation agenda that we would like to carry out but the bottom line is the difference between the republican message on innovation and investment in

line is that we want to make sure that we can move forward in the math and sciences and engineering we cdnnot get there by just saying it we have to put the investment in but guess what guess what the

recognize public charter schools public charter schools are the most important innovation in public education since the invention of free public education in our country they have become so popular they have become a movement growing like topsy the congress when newt gingrich was here as an alternative to vouchers helped jumpstart public charter schools in the district of columbia and in the nation by passing the first public charter school bill right here in the congress for the district with the agreement and total home rule involvement of the district of columbia that was in 1995 what did the schools do they helped us jumpstart a movement that has produced in the district of columbia the largest number of public charter schools per capita in the united states as i look down the list the district has more charter schools this one city than most states they have really taken off for some years now as an alternative to d c public schools when a child does not have a school that is offering that child and that family what the child deserves then the child must have an alternative it can be going out of its neighborhood and the best alternative and the only acceptable alternative it seems to me would be some other kind of public charter school that is what has happened in the district of columbia that is why the people of the district of columbia resent deeply that despite the growth of the charter school movement despite the fact that we have some of the best charter schools in the country and the largest number per capita that congress imposed on us something it would not accept for the rest of the country and that is private school vouchers well our people have voted with their feet they want a neighborhood school near them these schools are very important most of the religious schools are in northwest most of our kids who need or want alternative schools live in southeast so congress did vouchers for itself it did not do it for us and it did it against our will when in fact we had demonstrated that public charter schools were in fact working in d c and working very well a child must have an alternative but that alternative cannot be one where the public dollar is not accounted for where there is no oversight by the public and i am the last one who wants oversight for example of religious schools or anything involving religion it follows that religious schools must not be that alternative the thriving public charter school movement is in fact and should be that alternative all kinds of innovations are happening in the district of columbia that i invite people to come and see shared facilities in large buildings instead of getting rid of the building between public and charter schools collaboration now between the best of our charter schools and some public schools which are not doing so well public schools public charter schools unlike many public schools even under no child left behind are a case of the survival of the fittest 1100 you lose your charter in fact if you do not measure up that is what happens in the district of columbia as far as i know it happens wherever the schools are well run i simply want to note just for the record the kinds of reasons that charter schools flourish we have technology schools bilingual schools we have performing arts charter schools in the district we have math and science charter schools we have an enterprising development charter school i would just like to have the congress know some of the charter schools that are regarded as the best in the united states d c preparatory academy public charter school the friendship edison charter school kipp d c the key academy public charter school paul public charter school the district of columbia actually has the first public boarding school and it is a charter school it is called the seed public charter school this is what you can do this is the kind of innovation that comes from charter schools it doesnt come from religious schools they have their own way they have had it for hundreds of years if you want innovation in public education if you want an alternative to your public schools the best bet are charter schools which will be located right in your neighborhood which are so accountable that they lose their charters if they do not in fact produce i strongly support this resolution and i
