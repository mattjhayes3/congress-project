are developing bigger jobs bigger government here in washington d c so much so that the only city in this country that real estate prices have not gone down is washington d c theyve gone up why because this administration nancy pelosi harry reid and their colleagues in the house and the senate in the 111th congress are creating bigger government more regulations more taxes more attacks on jobs in the private sector more attacks on small businesses and its creating a bigger government thus higher real estate prices here in washington because weve created government jobs they claim about

excessive and frivolous lawsuits against our own energy production and it has significantly delayed and in many cases prevented our energy resources from reaching the american marketplace h r 1032 the relief act doesnt stop people from having their day in court but what it would do is it would allow the environmental wackos that are trying to stop energy production here in this country from having this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from the frivolous lawsuits by allowing the prevailing party to be able to seek legal fees and other expenses under the act this is the kind of bill

my district so our reliance for our local economy and for our state economy is just so very important i want to talk a little more about what this health care law is going to do to medicare and do to our hospitals there is 112 billion in reduced market basket updates to hospitals there is a 36 billion reduction to medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments now disproportionate share may sound a little confusing im going to explain what that is in a district such as mine we have hospitals that have missions and im sure across the country many hospitals have missions they want to make sure that the indigent population folks who cant afford insurance who are selfpays or maybe are on medicaid that they have access to quality services so the government says to these hospitals we understand that medicaid reimbursements or selfpay patients will not cover your services so what were going to do is were going to try to make you whole with this disproportionate share the health care law eliminates the disproportionate share for hospitals and so hospitals that have a high indigent population or a high number of selfpay patients or those who are on medicaid they are not going to get that disproportionate share the hospital in my district came down here it is a large teaching institution they made a special trip down here to tell me that provision of the health care law will bankrupt them they probably receive somewhere around 80 million a year to make them whole because of their mission and isnt that what we want we want to make sureand wasnt that the original intent of the health care law to make sure that there was accessible care for all americans but here again we reached the unintended consequences and the effect that this law is going to have on our hospitals there is a 7 1 billion reduction for readmissions we will talk about that in a little bit hospitals and many of the ones in my district and i know throughout this country they are heavily dependent on medicare and medicaid dollars and with that narrow margin medicare and medicaid dont even cover their costs and so theres such a small margin for them to operate that theres really little capacity for improvements realistically hospitalsespecially teaching hospitals and hospitals that are treating the underservedcannot bridge that gap and they wont be able to bridge that gap because of this new health care law hospitals must be able to invest in their infrastructure having such a narrow margin and or no margin operating in the red theyre not going to be able to do that theyre not going to be able to invest in infrastructure systems improvements new techniques to reduce hospitalacquired infections new models of delivering health care and electronic health records and i want to talk about electronic health records because they were mandated in the health care law the affordable care act mandates that hospitals must move to electronic health records now

another culture and at the same time youre learning about your own country and your own experiences because of the points of contrast what a wonderful thing it is that america has now tens of

different cultures knowing different languagesthereby providing a dimension to our own national life that we would otherwise not have if we did not have people who had had the experience of serving in

of our peace corps training the way we were living was among the people not behind these diplomatic bunkers that we sometimes see in the world today youre experiencing life in the country in which youre serving one thing just as an example is that peace corps volunteers of course do their assignments but theyre also people who do volunteer work of one kind or another one of the big hits was

the answer is and i didnt know what your answer was going to be but i felt sure you were going to answer the way you did for the simple reason that we hear our colleagues on the other side the democrats keep talking about wanting to create jobs but their policies are destroying jobsamerican jobs private pay jobs their policies are developing bigger jobs bigger government here in washington d c so much so that the only city in this country that real estate prices have not gone down is washington d c theyve gone up why because this administration nancy pelosi harry reid and their colleagues in the house and the senate in the 111th congress are creating bigger government more regulations more taxes more attacks on jobs in the private sector more attacks on small businesses and its creating a bigger government thus higher real estate prices here in washington because weve created government jobs they claim about all the jobs created with the stimulus bill et cetera but its government jobs is pretty much what were creating weve got another problem in fact i introduced h r 1032 the relief act because we have excessive and frivolous lawsuits against our own energy production and it has significantly delayed and in many cases prevented our energy resources from reaching the american marketplace h r 1032 the relief act doesnt stop people from having their day in court but what it would do is it would allow the environmental wackos that are trying to stop energy production here in this country from having this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from the frivolous lawsuits by allowing the prevailing party to be able to seek legal fees and other expenses under the act this is the kind of bill that we need to pass ive been asking members of congress

on because of my concern and i know my colleagues have such concerns about the health and the wellbeing of their hospitals as i mentioned earlier they are the largest employer in my district we refer to it as eds and meds we have a large university there and some colleges but we also have five hospitals in my district so our reliance for our local economy and for our state economy is just so very important i want to talk a little more about what this health care law is going to do to medicare and do to our hospitals there is 112 billion in reduced market basket updates to hospitals there is a 36 billion reduction to medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments now disproportionate share may sound a little confusing im going to explain what that is in a district such as mine we have hospitals that have missions and im sure across the country many hospitals have missions they want to make sure that the indigent population folks who cant afford insurance who are selfpays or maybe are on medicaid that they have access to quality services so the government says to these hospitals we understand that medicaid reimbursements or selfpay patients will not cover your services so what were going to do is were going to try to make you whole with this disproportionate share the health care law eliminates the disproportionate share for hospitals and so hospitals that have a high indigent population or a high number of selfpay patients or those who are on medicaid they are not going to get that disproportionate share the hospital in my district came down here it is a large teaching institution they made a special trip down here to tell me that provision of the health care law will bankrupt them they probably receive somewhere around 80 million a year to make them whole because of their mission and isnt that what we want we want to make sureand wasnt that the original intent of the health care law to make sure that there was accessible care for all americans but here again we reached the unintended consequences and the effect that this law is going to have on our hospitals there is a 7 1 billion reduction for readmissions we will talk about that in a little bit hospitals and many of the ones in my district and i know throughout this country they are heavily dependent on medicare and medicaid dollars and with that narrow margin medicare and medicaid dont even cover their costs and so theres such a small margin for them to operate that theres really little capacity for improvements realistically hospitalsespecially teaching hospitals and hospitals that are treating the underservedcannot bridge that gap and they wont be able to bridge that gap because of this new health care law hospitals must be able to invest in their infrastructure having such a narrow margin and or no margin operating in the red theyre not going to be able to do that theyre not going to be able to invest in infrastructure systems improvements new techniques to reduce hospitalacquired infections new models of delivering health care and electronic health records and i want to talk about electronic health records because they were mandated in the health care law the affordable care act mandates that hospitals must move to electronic health records now from a patient safety standpoint thats a good thing but getting hospitals up to speed and getting them ready for business has very high it costs for our hospitals so again youve got this health care law mandating electronic records and youve got these drastic cuts to our hospitals in their medicaid and
