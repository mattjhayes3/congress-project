seen the worst case of indecisiveness and procrastination on the part of congress relative to the budget process while we had an omnibus continuing resolution that contained all federal spending last year at least that cr was enacted by midoctober 1986 only a couple weeks after the start of the fiscal year this years bickering for 3 months after the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require each full year appropriations bill to be passed by congress individually and sent to the president in that form in lieu of separate movement of appropriations bills i have also cosponsored congressman mickey edwards bill h r 3199 that would require separation of any cr into the 13 individual appropriations bills upon presention to the president for signature i would hope that in view of the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many americans to sacrifice for the good of fiscal responsibility the least that members of congress can do is to contribute their 2 percent cola to that effort this legislation also contains language applauded by environmental groups that allows an 8month delay in sanctions for noncompliance with clean air act standards on ozone and carbon monoxide emissions this will pressure congress to reauthorize the clean air act this coming year instead of letting it slip into the next congress as some members had wished the cr also contains a provision that is very important to our nations dairy farmers the conferees on the agriculture appropriations section have included the text of my bill that will ensure

between our version and that of the senate regarding amendments to the endangered species act as my colleagues may know during their consideration of the endangered species act the senate adopted an amendment sponsored by senator howell heflin of alabama which delayed until may 1 1989 the effective date for mandatory use of teds in offshore waters the purpose of this delay was to allow the

colleagues that the legislation we are being asked to approve would not permit a federal employee or the dependent of a federal employee to receive health insurance coverage for all medical options in the event she is raped or is the victim of incest the legislation permits coverage of abortion services only if the life of the woman would be endangered if the pregnancy is carded to term since we have not debated this language in several years i would like to submit for the record a letter concerning this provision written in 1981 by the representatives of 2 million federal and postal

weeks twice in the past year the federal employees health benefits program feiud has come under attack through an mnendment sponsored by representative john ashbrook rohlo which would have prohibited the payment of administrative expenses of any federal employee health insurance plan which provides coverage for abortions and related medical conditions we believe that the ashbrook restriction constitutes an unwarranted attempt by the congress to inject itself into the collectivebargaining process by eliminating a medical benefit which federal employees have negotiated as part of their total compensation package presently the government has little involvement in the federal employees health benefits fehb program it merely negotiates the level of benefits and administers the program and the plans funds the government does not decide what kind of medical program or procedures will be covered this is done through negotiation with the carriers federal workers may choose from a variety of health insurance plans some of which do not provide coverage for even medically necessary abortions we believe that this freedom of choice in mediral plan selection must be preserved further in 1972 congress passed section 117 title vii of the civil rights act to provide that the federal government may not discriminate against its employees on the basis of race sex religion national origin or age in 1978 congress enacted the pregnancy dlscrimination act which redefined and clarified the definition of sex discrimination under title vii to include di crimination on the basis of pregnancy childbirth and related medical conditions the ashbrook amendment as adopted by the house on two occasions would deny medical benefits to females solely on the basis of their sex by mandating the elinination of health insurance coverage for conditions related to pregnancy this could reverse the effect of congressionally mandated bans on discrimination as reflected in the 1972 and 1978 acts in addition when on april 20 1979 the equal employment opportunity commission published its guidelines on the pregnancy discrimination act it stated that no employer would be in compliance with title vii if it reduced benefits prior to the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement if congress adopts the ashbrook amendment it will affect all collectivebargaining agreements in the federal sector immediately by requiring the renegotiation of health benefits contracts prior to the expiration of current collectivebargaining agreements the commission further stated that if an employer in this case the federal govern ment reduces benefits for one class of employees it must effect a concommitant reduction in benefits for all other classes of employees this would necessitate

gentleman from massachusetts the fairness doctrine has been a regulation of the federal communications commission for over 25 years it has been challenged studied threatened and bantered about for the last several years over the last 2 years the fcc has undertaken an effort to repeal the fairness doctrine that effort has sparked the current debate the legislation before us today is intended to settle the debate by codifying the fairness doctrine into our communications laws it is important to note however that the debate is not simply a legislative issue the doctrine is currently subject to court challenge and quite frankly it will be settled in the court i believe by codifying the doctrine it actually assists the courts in ruling on the doctrines constitutionality i understand that the communications laws place special duties and privileges with broadcasters this unique treatment arises from the right to broadcast given by the government to a chosen few the broadcaster accepts an obligation to the community when he receives his license broadcasters are obliged and licensed to serve their communities fair and complete news is inherent in such public service it is unfortunate that we must resort tc any form of government requirementc for enforcing that obligation but i also acknowledge that the fair ness doctrine is not an overly burden some restriction imposed by the gov eminent as presently administerec under the current state of technolog3 and the market the doctrine does vest broad editorial responsibility with the broadcaster with appropriate deference given to the good faith and reasonable judgment of licensees only a handful of complaints are actually processed by the government under current circumstances it is not an intrusive program of government

limit congress to six 2year terms in the house and two ayear terms in the senate i also introduced a resolution that was a companion to that as an alternative that called for three 4year house terms and two 6yeat senate terms as a constitutionally mandated limit we limit the term of our president why do we not limit the terms of our house and our senate well there are a lot of reasons i suppose politically why that is not very palatable for this body to do to itself or to do to the voters but it is something this year in particular because we have just gone through a celebration of the constitutions anniversary it is noteworthy that in the republican convention in our platform one of my former colleagues from south carolina tommy hartnet offered in the resolution forum of the platform a particular provision that to the best of my knowledge and our research has never been offered before in any convention of any political party in the history of our country and it was adopted in that portion of the platform dealing with term limitation it reads as follows we favor a constitutional amendment which will place some restrictions on the number of consecutive terms a man or woman may serve in the unitedstates house of representatives or the unitedstates senate so this evening i thought it was appropriate to talk about that for a little bit to see what we might join together to do about this process and perhaps to gain some new adherents to the purposes and objectives of this term limitation concept the earliest proposed constitutional amendment to limit was introduced in the first congress in 1789 the resolution n that congress stipulated that no person could serve more than 6 years in an 8year period actually the concept predated the constitution the continental congress adopted a proposal by john dixon of delaware in 1777 limiting delegates tinder the articles of confederation to serving 3 years in any 6year period however after the first congress the issue of limiting terms laid dormant until the mid1940s the primary reason for this dormancy was in the early years of our country to serve only 2 years in the unitedstates house and then retire nobody served longer than that they just did not as late as the 1840s 40 to 50 percent of the congress left office after each election 40 to 50 percent as late as the 1840s from 1860 to 1920 the average length of service doubled from 4 to 8 years by 1901 when the 57th congress convened for the first time less than 30 percent of its members were freshmen in 1981 when the 97th congress convened only 17 percent of the unitedstates house of representatives were freshmen a remarkably low number i think most of us are aware that with increasing frequency we reelect incumbents i think last time we had an election in this country a couple of years ago we reelected 98 percent of our colleagues back to the house there are some who think we will reelect approximately that percentage again this time i do not think that is healthy for our nation we need new ideas vigorous concerns here not just a question of some of the issues we are going to talk about tonight that might otherwise be a good idea why we should limit the terms of congressmen but just for the sake of getting bright new faces in this body with greater frequency than simply based upon a retirement prospect perhaps the most significant growth issue in this whole idea has been the public support for the concept in 1946 a gallup poll showed 40 percent of the american public favored lengthening the terms of house members to 4 years by 1961 51 percent of the public supported 4year terms and this was about the same in 1977 however in the most recent gallup poll published in the washington post on may 17 1981 a clear 59 percent of the american people supported the lengthening of terms of house members to 4 years that same poll showed that by a margin of better than 2 to 1 the american people want to limit unitedstates senators and representatives to a maximum of 12 years in office i think that is the most important issue of this it does not seem to me that the two should be separated but there are some who strongly do not believe in the lengthening of house terms but whatever the case may be those of us who support the concept of lengthening terms also support the concept of limiting them and those who join us only on that issue i must say to them that i think that this is the single most issue important issue and that is the one that we are here to talk about tonight the simple fact is that the concern of most congressmen for getting reelected causes them to spend a good deal of time and energy on matters related to that and that is unfortunately what all of us do that influences the decisionmaking away from what otherwise would be the course of better judgment in many cases not all case but in many cases a limitation on terms would assure that a substantial portion of congress at any time would be ineligible for reelection and vitually unfettered by the constraints of reelection in addition to limiting terms if there were a lengthening of terms i think the effect would be even greater the bottom line is simply that there is not enough time for us to do all the duties that are expected of us today as opposed to back in 1840 or 1900 or 1940 for that matter we have career congressmen back in the early days of this country we found people who served were really here for only a couple months a year in fact well into the 1940s and 1950s it was the practice to stay no more than 3 months a year at one time not very long ago it was 6 months now it is a yearround proposition and it is very difficult to find anyone who could conceive of congressmen going back home after a couple months here and working in other jobs they do not do that and that is really the most seriouz problem when coupled with the pressaires that come with todays society that is really the bottom line problem we are career oriented here once you get elected to congress at a certain stage of your life and you are here it is like any other job there is a security blanket factor there is a great desire to be reelected instead of going back out into public life while for some people and for the public in some instances that is a great service a great sacrifice as a matter of fact for many others and for the public as a whole i think that it is not it is jnst tile opposite of that but the fact of life is that you are not going to change we are not going to change the business of congress there are so many issues so many subject matters to be brought up the government of the united states has grown so large that a yearround functioning body is really a necessity and i think it will always be with us but coming with that comes again this pressure for remaining here this desire this lack of going back and being reinvigorated by going back to a job and being a businessman in a business somewhere back home or being a doctor or a lawyer or whatever the profession is and then staying here year after year and getting somewhat isolated from it it is a difficult thing but that is what has happened and unless we limit the terms of congressmen we are going to continue to see this trend and it will not be an easy one to break coming along with that come the pressures o fundraise the pressures that come on us in the voting process when it comes to making a decision on what is the best thing to do i remember when i was here in the first term of congress there was a vote on the question of funding for libraries in this country nobody is against libraries there was a 10 million program that had come out of lyndon johnsons great society 10 million a year not billion but million now that is a lot of money to me and to you and to everybody else but by the way we do things around here 10 million a year is not comparatively a lot of money there was a proposal to eliminate that program and that proposal was supported by a number of the original adherents of it saying really the purpose of the federal government is not to support libraries that is a comnmunity thing back home the reason we had the 10 million was to get the rural libraries going to stimulate libraries to be started and we have done most all we need to do in that regard and if we are going to get this budget of ours in balance it is time that we proceed and do something about that and go ahead and eliminate this program well it came to a vote on the floor here i remember some of my good conservative colleagues as well as others here in this body scratching their heads a minute and i heard a murmuring around the room here as that vote was in progress you know we ought to get rid of this thing it isnt serving any purpos6 it has already done what its supposed to do we have seeded some rural libraries but you know i wonder what the friends of the library back home would think of me if i were to go on record and appear to have voted against libraries so our friends my colleagues voted overwhelmingly despite the recommendations of even the authors of that proposal and the original adherents to it voted overwhelmingly to continue the funding of that 10 million a year program that is one small example of what goes on here that is indeed a real big problem for us so that is one of many reasons why i became convinced more so than ever after i got here that we ought to limit the terms of congresmen in this body and get back to more of a citizen legislator and have an opportunity for there to be a relief of that pressure so that there is not so much a concern about what is somebody back home over every little issue going to think of how i did it and more concern of what is right and what should be done in restricting the budget and getting some common sense back into the government that is just one of a number of reasons i have had a number of my good friends who have supported this concept since we all came together here in 1980 who are with us tonight one of them is the gentleman from oregon mr denny smritm the gentleman looks like he is wanting me to yield to

seeks to combat the drug problem with a multifaceted approach by providing funds and informational assistance for drug education rehabilitation law enforcement and eradication programs and while every

part of congress relative to the budget process while we had an omnibus continuing resolution that contained all federal spending last year at least that cr was enacted by midoctober 1986 only a couple weeks after the start of the fiscal year this years bickering for 3 months after the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require each full year appropriations bill to be passed by congress individually and sent to the president in that form in lieu of separate movement of appropriations bills i have also cosponsored congressman mickey edwards bill h r 3199 that would require separation of any cr into the 13 individual appropriations bills upon presention to the president for signature i would hope that in view of the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many americans to sacrifice for the good of fiscal responsibility the least that members of congress can do is to contribute their 2 percent cola to that effort this legislation

under attack through an mnendment sponsored by representative john ashbrook rohlo which would have prohibited the payment of administrative expenses of any federal employee health insurance plan which provides coverage for abortions and related medical conditions we believe that the ashbrook restriction constitutes an unwarranted attempt by the congress to inject itself into the collectivebargaining process by eliminating a medical benefit which federal employees have negotiated as part of their total compensation package presently the government has little involvement in the federal employees health benefits fehb program it merely negotiates the level of benefits and administers the program and the plans funds the government does not decide what kind of medical program or procedures will be covered this is done through negotiation with the carriers federal workers may choose from a variety of health insurance plans some of which do not provide coverage for even medically necessary abortions we believe that this freedom of choice in mediral plan selection must be preserved further in 1972 congress passed section 117 title vii of the civil rights act to provide that the federal government may not discriminate against its employees on the basis of race sex religion national origin or age in 1978 congress enacted the pregnancy dlscrimination act which redefined and clarified the definition of sex discrimination under title vii to include di crimination on the basis of pregnancy childbirth and related medical conditions the ashbrook amendment as adopted by the house on two occasions would deny medical benefits to females solely on the basis of their sex by mandating the elinination of health insurance coverage for conditions related to pregnancy this could reverse the effect of congressionally mandated bans on discrimination as reflected in the 1972 and 1978 acts in addition when on april 20 1979 the equal employment opportunity commission published its guidelines on the pregnancy discrimination act it stated that no employer would be in compliance with title vii if it reduced benefits prior to the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement if congress adopts the ashbrook amendment it will affect all collectivebargaining agreements in the federal sector immediately by requiring the renegotiation of health benefits contracts prior to the expiration of current collectivebargaining agreements the commission further stated that if an employer in this case the federal govern ment reduces benefits for one class of employees it must effect a concommitant reduction in benefits for all other classes of employees this would necessitate the total reconstruction of all federal employee health insurance

obligation but i also acknowledge that the fair ness doctrine is not an overly burden some restriction imposed by the gov eminent as presently administerec under the current state of technolog3 and the market the doctrine does vest broad editorial responsibility with the broadcaster with appropriate deference given to the good faith and reasonable judgment of licensees only a handful of complaints are actually processed by the government under current circumstances it is not an intrusive program of government censorship or control technology has brought us all sorts of alternative electronic means to reach the public but at this time alternative sources simply do not permeate the electronic horizon sufficiently for us to conclude at this moment that wouldbe broadcasters have adequate opportunities to reach the public through these budding technologies not only is technology changing but so is the broadcast industry i considered offering an amendment in the markup of h r 1934 by the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance to exempt radio from this bill because radio marketplace is so different than television such an amendment lacked support at that time however i remain concerned and i am pleased to support my colleague from new york mr green in his amendment to exempt radio one other issue concerns me and that is the references in the committee report to the fairness doctrine application to cable providers not now covered i do not recall one single mention of a fairness doctrine for cable during our hearing or markups my understanding is that h r 1934 merely codifies the existing fairness doctrine regulation for the time being and that is all any other notions of how it ought to be expanded are beyond the scope of h r 1934 as i understand it"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as the sponsor of house joint resolution 399 i rise in support of senate joint resolution 196 which would designate february 4 1988 as national women in sports day over the last 15 years the level of womens participation in sports and physical conditioning programs has dramatically increased however there has been little national recognition of the significance of womens athletic achievements by drawing attention to women in sports we can recognize women athletes who serve as examples of the avenues available through which women of america may develop physical fitness selfdiscipline initiative confidence and leadership skills national women in sports day while recognizing the outstanding accomplishments of women in sports will also point to the fact that women students still have far fewer opportunities for athletic achievements than men at the same institutions today women repre sent 35 percent of all collegiate athletes however the athletic opportunities for male students at both the college and high school levels still far exceeds those for female students women comprise 52 percent of college enrollments but only one dollar in five of financial aid based on athletic ability is awarded to women while i applaud the progress that has been made over the last 15 years i believe we february 1988 must also acknowledge the large inequities that still exist for women in the area of athletics national women in sports day will be a step toward giving women in sports the recognition and attention they deserve hopefully this day will encourage more women to experience the pleasure of sports activity that develops lifelong habits of physical fitness"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "at the outset let me first of all congratulate the chairman of the committee on the judiciary and the appropriate subcommittees along with the ranking minority members of those subcommittees for a piece of legislation that i think has long been needed in this country i am of course talking about the omnibus drug control bill it will go a long way ini beginning to build some controls on the streets and education with our young people that is so critically necessary to fight this national plague let me address myself though specifically to title vi subsqction 6503 this is an important issue and an important area and i have to believe that the subcommittee on crime in large part added a portion to this legislation that is if not needed at least unworkable i am talking about a 7day waiting period on handguns this morning i was privileged to introduce 115 rankandfile cops on the beat you could call them from over 27 states in this nation they came here to lobby they came here to lobby us membprs of congress on this legislation not in opposition to the omnibus crime control bill but certainly in opposition to this section because as they said so clearly this morning it will not deter the criminal it will be the honest lawabiding citizen that might be without a gun or that will be limited in his or her right to acquire a gun while the criminal the drug dealer on the street will still be bzying his gun from behind the bar for an exorbitant amount of money because he has it or out of the back of a car that moves into a community to sell handguns to young kids on the street that are pushing crack that is really the issue i hope as we debate this bill and as we move toward amendments that we will look at some reasonable alternatives that are valuable to us as we move to amend this important legislation i hope when we arrive at this section we will look most clearly at the mccollum alternative or the mccollum substitute that will devise a mechanism by which we will be able to track and identify those individuas who are criminals attempt ing to acquire a gun that really is the issue here to take guns away from criminals and not take guns away from lawabiding citizens or in sorne way to restrict the right of the individual lawabiding citizen to do so we have provided positive alternatives for the lawenforcement community alternatives that 115 rankandfile cops on the street supported and endorsed today as they came to lobby us here let us make the appropriate amendments pass this most important legislation for our country and hopefully improve the climate on the streets for the young people and for the lawabiding citizen"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "because of an injury that required a brief hospitalization i was unable to attend the session of the house on tuesday may 5 if i had been present on rollcall no 80

good provisions of h r 27 for instance language is included which extends forbearance to wellmanaged institutions operating with impaired capital levels in designated economically depressed areas such forbearance is essential in texas where the state of the energy real estate and agriculture industries has left many institutions struggling with troubled loans the gao recently testified that the
