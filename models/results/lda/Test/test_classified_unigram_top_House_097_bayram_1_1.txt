remain the citizens branch it is inconceivable to me that we could ever in this body match the expertise of the executive branch or that we should even try to do so the proliferation of committees

of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other

the evidence you go prepared to make up your mind based on the evidence that is presented and maybe everybody there decides based on the evidence that is presented that there is one way to go but a chairman or someone else will pull the proxies out of his pocket and vote the opposite way for those people who never had the benefit of those hearings that were actually taken it then happens on the committee level where proxies are allowed to be voted then we come here on the floor of the house and we have bills that really are not in good shape what happens when we on the minority side i 850

those problems it is not being dealt with on the floor so the committee staffing goes beyond us picking up the cudgel thrown by the president of the united states to try to slim down government to its regular size so that we are fighting trim instead of being overweight and trying to slug ourselves through a fight that we cannot win it goes to the very question of how this institution operates if

that there are notbut there is a certain feeling that develops after awhile when you are here long after the members are here when you stay on the committees and the subcommittees long after they do i

for the republican research committees economic task force budget study subcommittee this subcommittee produced a work product in the latter part of july wherein we identified 272 itqms where savings could be made in fiscal year 1982 these totaled some 52 billion we are not necessarily su~ggesting that these items should all be implemented we are saying that if the congress would assert the courage in this institution to make the cuts necessary to balance the budget these items among others certainly should be considered on previous days i have read very briefly through items relating to legislative 21 cuts judiciary 8 cuts executive office 4 cuts funds for the president 15 cuts agriculture 27 cuts commerce 8 cuts defense military 15 cuts defense civil 4 cuts education 9 cuts energy 13 cuts and health and human services 16 cuts today i would propose to read through a list of cuts for housing and urban development totaling 15 for some 3 304 249 600 and in the department of the interior 6 cuts totaling 297 557 300 the first item from hud is housing programs subsidized housing in this category we would allow 20 percent above fiscal year 1980 the proposal as it is in the present law would provide for a 51 4percent increase over the preceding year moreover the gao finds considerable overcommitment of funds due to inaccuracies in contracts we believe this is excessive and should not be tolerated if adopted this would save 1 421 941 800 in housing programs payments for operation of lowincome housing projects we would cut 10 percent from 1981 these projects have been illadvised illconceived and illmanaged we propose eliminating operation of september 24 1 981 rrentarks e 4437 the most wasteful portions of those projects and achieve savings of 215 080 000 housing programs congregate services would be eliminated funding authority for this program has already been deleted and remaining outlays should follow suit this would save if adopted 5 300 000 housing programs troubled project operation subsidy we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the additional funding of housing projects is redundant if the worst offenders would be deleted we could remove that redundancy this would save if adopted 57 399 200 housing programs lowrent housing loans and expenditures we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the current proposal is for an increase of 173 5percent increase from 1980 which is altogether in our judgment unnecessary and unreasonable if implemented this would save 51 473 400 government national mortgage association special assistance functions we would improve this by following the recommendations of the general accounting office for improving accounting procedures which if adopted for this program would save 22 700 000 onma emergency mortgage purchase assistance we would improve the servicing of multifamily mortgages and provide incentives for prompt payments this again is a recommendation of the general accounting office if adopted it is estimated to save 500 million community planning and development community development support assistance wve would cut 10 percent from proposed funding for block grants not including udag these grants have helped corporations and developers not the needy this would save 411 300 000 community planning and development community development support assistance we would eliminate udag funding to decaying inner cities which should be redeveloped under the concept of enterprise zones not out of subsidies from the public treasury if implemented and adopted this would save 500 million new community development corporation we would eliminate funding for this program because we feel it can be better financed in creation of enterprise zones if adopted this would save 37 117 000 neighborhoods voluntary associations and consumer protection interstate land sales we would eliminate this on the grounds that the federal government should never have gotten in to this area to begin with and n addition this regulatory body has expanded into the intrastate field as well which certainly is not justified if implemented this would save 300 000 fair housing and equal opportunity we would eliminate this on the grounds that it is unnecessary it should not be functioning as a separate program but rather as policy if adopted this would save 6 100 000 management and administration public assistance and income supplement we would allow a growth of 20 percent above 1980 currently proposed spending represents a 5 1 8percent increase from 1980 which we believe to be excessive if implemented this would save 19 572 800 management and administration law enforcement activities we would allow a 20percent growth above 1980 the proposed increase is unnecessary because of cutbacks in enforcement activities if implemented this would reduce spending by 1 570 400 finally for this category we would follow the recommendation of the general accounting office by correcting auditing procedures which if implemented would save 54 395 000 in the department of the interior the first item here of the six that are proposed departmentwide we would correct auditing procedures recommended by the general accounting office which if implemented would reduce spending for this category by 59 510 000 land and water resources elm range improvement we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by limiting further land acquisition if implemented this would save 1 350 000 land and water resources blm resource management we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by restricting regulation and management if implemented this would reduce spending by 24 482 500 land and water resources elm miscellaneous permanent appropriation general purpose fiscal assistance we would allow 20percent growth above what was spent in 1980 the current proposal allows a 74 4percent increase from 1980 which we perceive as unwarranted this if adopted would save 201 515 600 land and water resources water and power resource service general administration we would allow 20percent above 1980 the proposed 50 1percent increase from 1980 is in our judgment excessive and should not be tolerated this if implemented would reduce spending in fiscal year 1982 by 8 899 200 land and water resources office of water policy salaries and expenses we would eliminate this new agency on the grounds that it is not needed there is little justification for its existence in our opinion this if implemented would reduce spending by 1 800 000 to sum up this category of the department of interior these six items would result in spending 297 557 300 less in fiscal year 1982 for the department of housing and urban development the 15 items total 3 304 249 600 some members in this chamber may from time to time ask the question if it is so simple why do we not do it that is why do we not balance the budget why do we not assert the necessary independence to bring the discipline to bear to match the outgowith the income and remove one of the great obstacles to economic recovery of this country the answer to that question is puzzling but it is probably more political than anything else there is a drum beat that runs through these chambers which says that if the members exhibit the courage to cut the spending this will1 aggravate those people and organizations adversely affected and these same special interests who are cut down or cut off will retaliate against the offending members in the voting booth that philosophy has been driving this institution for almost a generation it still is the controlling philosophy in this chamber then you may ask what hope is there for the people of this country if we who have the stewardship of raising taxes and voting spending do not have the courage to match the outgo with the income i think one constructive way is to demonstrate that we can balance the budget of this nation in fiscal year 1982 while at the same time providing for the recognized needs of the downtrodden the poor the handicapped and the deprived in our society because when you analyze these items that i have been reading i challenge members to stand up and honestly say that we cannot do that because if we adopted this or that item we would be working against the genuine interests of the poor the downtrodden the handicapped and the deprived those who do not have the ability to fend for themselves i say to the members here look at these items carefully we have prepared them in all sincerity we as an institution cannot go on year after year spending more money then we take in in this fiscal year which will close in less than a week we will have probably gone into debt roughly 90 billion in the last 5 years we have added to our national debt over 300 billion notwithstanding the election of november 1980 the spending of the congress of the united states is today out of control the members of this institution do not have the discipline at least as they have exhibited it up to now to match the outgo with the income i think the constructive thing for us to do is to demonstrate with a work product of this type that we can cut spending we can cut our bureaucracy we can cut out waste fraud and

the bill also establishes a procedure for the attorney general to issue certificates of review indicating the etc would not be in violation of antitrust laws the certification procedure developed by h r 1799 would provide greater certainty for export trading companies operations it was this lack of certainty in the webbpromerene act that kept that law from serving as a greater stimulus to export trade by correcting the deficiencies of that law and adding services to the accepted list of activities that can be the basis for forming etcs h r 1799 goes a long way toward meeting the challenge of the japanese and european trading company competitors the administration strongly supports this bill and the concept of export trading companies as secretary baldrige says export trading company legislation is an important step in mobilizing our untapped export resources the risks and costs involved in marketing products overseas coupled with a lack of knowledge of foreign markets and of the cultural complexities of an unfamiliar society deter small and even mediumsized companies from attempting to export their goods the existence of etcs who specialize in exporting who can assume the risks who have the financial capability and the legal and technical expertise to penetrate foreign markets will permit these small and mediumsized firms to improve greatly their export performance another important feature of h r 1799 is the reference to the role of states in initiating promoting and expanding exports in their own efforts to improve export trade certainly in the case of california the state has been a leader in shaping export policy that deals efficiently with trade and services with its neighbors to the south and in the pacific basin i strongly support the

principles of fiscal responisibility and wha i consider after a year and a half of intense study on the space subcommittee to be in the best interests of our civilian space program our telecommunications industry and our national security to begin let me offer a bit of pertinent upperstage history last year the space science subcommittee as you have heard directed nasa and the defense department to conduct a joint study to determine our needs for a high energy upper stage this is that study upper stage alternatives for the shuttle era a nasadod report to congress we have had it for over a year the study concluded that nasa should begin developing a centaur for space shuttle use since the reports completion nothing significantly has changed to warrant deleting centaur from nasas budget in fact on page 81 of this report that we commissioned it specifically rejects the end effect of the flippo amendment namely an ius galileo combined mission fortunately the president accepted the urgent supplemental last july 18 and sustained the funding for the centaur high energy upper stage integration into the shuttle the presidents acceptance is consistent with nasas 1982 authorization and appropriation bills and recognizes the technical superiority of centaur as well as the fact that centaur integration obviates the need for an otherwise redundant 1 to 11 billion for an air force high energy stage program for military and intelligence uses which we will have need for in the 1987 timeframe i would like to briefly outline four compelling reasons why the house should support the nasa air force recommendations and reject the flippo amendment first ius cannot meet our high energy upper stage requirements for nasa dod and commercial missions beyond the 198586 timeframe our high priority space missions are increasingly finding weight to be a limiting factor the ius can currently lift only 5 000 pounds compared to the 10 000 to 14 000 pounds provided by centaur second the failure to move decisively now to develop a high energy upper stage for shuttle will result in an increasing loss of business to foreign competition specifically the french ariane the ariane vehicle will lift approximately 9 500 pounds to geosynchronous orbit by 198687 thus exceeding ius capabilities without centaur the united states will lose this commercial market third development of a new high energy upper stage coupled with the decision to fly galileo and the international solar polar mission with an ius will cost taxpayers at least 700 million to 800 million more than centaur take at least 2 years longer to complete and yield no significant performance improvement indeed it has been estimated that a brandnew stage as i say will cost between 1 and 1 billion and will basically involve reinventing the centaur fourth and finally launching galileo and solar polar on centaur has a number of critical advantages over using ius for these missions centaur would provide a flight time of 26 months for nasas galileo mission and would guarantee 11 satellite encounters compared to a flight time of more than double 54 months and 6 satellite encounters for an ius launch plus the increased risk of the increased time in the case of solar polar centaur restores the maximum possible mission as well as nasas credibility with its foreign partners most notably the european space agency it is very likely that another change in launch vehicles will cause our international friends to question our resolve and ultimately conclude that nasa is an unreliable partner

districts which have ethnic heritage and allow them through some mechanism to serve in an advisory capacity on both domestic and international issues my actions in the congress have benefited from the input i have received from my ethnic citizens advisory council and i am confident that many other members would benefit similarly while the united states must continue to speak out constructively for oppressed peoples of the world the unitedstatess r is moving in the opposite direction the soviets need to be reminded that the helsinki agreement redrew the boundaries of eastern europe in exchange for their guarantee that certain rights would be respected we and other helsinki signatories must continue to insist that the soviets live up to their agreement we must continue to speak out in a strong voice against the physical and personal abuses of individuals such as those courageous women who visited my office yesterday for so many of those people we and world opinion are the only hope they have if we fall to speak out they will be crushed and the price that so many have already paid will be for naught i am hopeful that congress and the american people will continue to speak up for the principles and values of personal dignity and freedom that this nation has always stood for and that other members will see that in their own congressional districts there are voices of ethnic americans who have a firm and clear understanding of what the problems are within the soviet union and the repressive acts against the soviet unions nationalities and communistbloc neighboring countries these ethnic advisory councils can serve to aid members on domestic issues as well for too long the voices of our ethnic american communities have been largely ignored and these voices have many learning experiences on the major issues facing the congress such an advisory council however in my own district ranges in its activities from commenting on the national and international issues to creating a cooperative group effort to foster tourism in our district related to ethnic affairs most importantly it works cooperatively to retain the languages the customs and the traditions that

rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal

your mind based on the evidence that is presented and maybe everybody there decides based on the evidence that is presented that there is one way to go but a chairman or someone else will pull the proxies out of his pocket and vote the opposite way for those people who never had the benefit of those hearings that were actually taken it then happens on the committee level where proxies are

300 the first item from hud is housing programs subsidized housing in this category we would allow 20 percent above fiscal year 1980 the proposal as it is in the present law would provide for a 51 4percent increase over the preceding year moreover the gao finds considerable overcommitment of funds due to inaccuracies in contracts we believe this is excessive and should not be tolerated if adopted this would save 1 421 941 800 in housing programs payments for operation of lowincome housing projects we would cut 10 percent from 1981 these projects have been illadvised illconceived and illmanaged we propose eliminating operation of september 24 1 981 rrentarks e 4437 the most wasteful portions of those projects and achieve savings of 215 080 000 housing programs congregate services would be eliminated funding authority for this program has already been deleted and remaining outlays should follow suit this would save if adopted 5 300 000 housing programs troubled project operation subsidy we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the additional funding of housing projects is redundant if the worst offenders would be deleted we could remove that redundancy this would save if adopted 57 399 200 housing programs lowrent housing loans and expenditures we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the current proposal is for an increase of 173 5percent increase from 1980 which is altogether in our judgment unnecessary and unreasonable if implemented this would save 51 473 400 government national mortgage association special assistance functions we would improve this by following the recommendations of the general accounting office for improving accounting procedures which if adopted for this program would save 22 700 000 onma emergency mortgage purchase assistance we would improve the servicing of multifamily mortgages and provide incentives for prompt payments this again is a recommendation of the general accounting office if adopted it is estimated to save 500 million community planning and development community development support assistance wve would cut 10 percent from proposed funding for block grants not including udag these grants have helped corporations and developers not the needy this would save 411 300 000 community planning and development community development support assistance we would eliminate udag funding to decaying inner cities which should be redeveloped under the concept of enterprise zones not out of subsidies from the public treasury if implemented and adopted this would save 500 million new community development corporation we would eliminate funding for this program because we feel it can be better financed in creation of enterprise zones if adopted this would save 37 117 000 neighborhoods voluntary associations and consumer protection interstate land sales we would eliminate this on the grounds that the federal government should never have gotten in to this area to begin with and n addition this regulatory body has expanded into the intrastate field as well which certainly is not justified if implemented this would save 300 000 fair housing and equal opportunity we would eliminate this on the grounds that it is unnecessary it should not be functioning as a separate program but rather as policy if adopted this would save 6 100 000 management and administration public assistance and income supplement we would allow a growth of 20 percent above 1980 currently proposed spending represents a 5 1 8percent increase from 1980 which we believe to be excessive if implemented this would save 19 572 800 management and administration law enforcement activities we would allow a 20percent growth above 1980 the proposed increase is unnecessary because of cutbacks in enforcement activities if implemented this would reduce spending by 1 570 400 finally for this category we would follow the recommendation of the general accounting office by correcting auditing procedures which if implemented would save 54 395 000 in the department of the interior the first item here of the six that are proposed departmentwide we would correct auditing procedures recommended by the general accounting office which if implemented would reduce spending for this category by 59 510 000 land and water resources elm range improvement we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by limiting further land acquisition if implemented this would save 1 350 000 land and water resources blm resource management we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by restricting regulation and management if implemented this would reduce spending by 24 482 500 land and water resources elm miscellaneous permanent appropriation general purpose fiscal assistance we would allow 20percent growth above what was spent in 1980 the current

administration we would allow 20percent above 1980 the proposed 50 1percent increase from 1980 is in our judgment excessive and should not be tolerated this if implemented would reduce spending in

justification for its existence in our opinion this if implemented would reduce spending by 1 800 000 to sum up this category of the department of interior these six items would result in spending 297

or cut off will retaliate against the offending members in the voting booth that philosophy has been driving this institution for almost a generation it still is the controlling philosophy in this chamber then you may ask what hope is there for the people of this country if we who have the stewardship of raising taxes and voting spending do not have the courage to match the outgo with the income i think one constructive way is to demonstrate that we can balance the budget of this nation in fiscal year 1982 while at the same time providing for the recognized needs of the downtrodden the poor the handicapped and the deprived in our society because when you analyze these items that i have been reading i challenge members to stand up and honestly say that we cannot do that because if we adopted this or that item we would be working against the genuine interests of the poor the downtrodden the handicapped and the deprived those who do not have the ability to fend for themselves i say to the members here look at these items carefully we have prepared them in all sincerity we as an institution cannot go on year after year spending more money then we take in in this fiscal year which will close in less than a week we will have probably gone into debt roughly 90 billion in the last 5 years we have added to our national debt over 300 billion notwithstanding the election of november 1980 the spending of the congress of the united states is today out of control the members of this institution do not have the discipline at least as they have exhibited it up to now to match the outgo with the income i think the constructive thing for us to do is to demonstrate with a work product of this type that we can cut spending we can cut our bureaucracy we can cut out waste fraud and abuse i think it is reasonable to undertake this effort in a bipartisan way and try to bring some fiscal sanity into the affairs of this nation"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as a cosponsor of h r 1799 i want to congratulate the administration and particularly secretary of commerce mac baldrige for their tireless efforts in promoting the export trading company concept the members of this house are fully aware i am sure that etc legislation has been the subject of extensivc hearings in three committees in the house over a period in some cases of several years the other body passed legislation during both the 96th congress and the 1st session of the 97th congress and only now have we finally reached the floor with our own export trading company bill it is long overdue but we can be thankful that it is finally here i believe h r 1799 represents a responsible approach to helping improve americas export capability and theieby improving our serious balanceoftrade deficit by promoting the establishment of export trading companies h r 1799 should prove to be particularly beneficial for small and mediumsized businesses that do not have the experience or resources to attempt export trade on their own the bill also establishes a procedure for the attorney general to issue certificates of review indicating the etc would not be in violation of antitrust laws the certification procedure developed by h r 1799 would provide greater certainty for export trading companies operations it was this lack of certainty in the webbpromerene act that kept that law from serving as a greater stimulus to export trade by correcting the deficiencies of that law and adding services to the accepted list of activities that can be the basis for forming etcs h r 1799 goes a long way toward meeting the challenge of the japanese and european trading company competitors the administration strongly supports this bill and the concept of export trading companies as secretary baldrige says export trading company legislation is an important step in mobilizing our untapped export resources the risks and costs involved in marketing products overseas coupled with a lack of knowledge of foreign markets and of the cultural complexities of an unfamiliar society deter small and even mediumsized companies from attempting to export their goods the existence of etcs who specialize in exporting who can assume the risks who have the financial capability and the legal and technical expertise to penetrate foreign markets will permit these small and mediumsized firms to improve greatly their export performance another important feature of h r 1799 is the reference to the role of states in initiating promoting and expanding exports in their own efforts to improve export trade certainly in the case of california the state has been a leader in shaping export policy that deals efficiently with trade and services with its neighbors to the south and in the pacific basin i strongly support the provisions of h r 1799 designed to promote the development of new export trading companies dealing in goods and services i urge my colleagues to give their full support to this bill"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as a former president of a credit union i am keenly aware of the strong contribution that credit unions make to our economy and our society credit unions have never backed away from deregulation and have never been afraid to compete in order to provide their members with the best possible services today i want to bring to the attention of my house colleagues an informative brochure developed by the national association of federal credit unions entitled facts about federal credit unions federal credit unions are chartered and regulated by the federal government according to nafcu the national trade organiza tion which represents federal credit unions there are over 12 000 fcus nationwide with total assets of over 40 billion more than 26 million individuals belong to federal credit unions federal credit unions are organized as cooperatives and are nonprofitf remarks january 27 1989 making control and management of these institutions rests with credit union members further volunteers play an important part in the operations of many federal credit unions in my opinion no financial institution embodies american democratic principles as closely as credit unions i am pleased to submit the nafcu brochure for the record and i urge all my colleagues to read it carefully"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as a member of the house space science and applications subcommittee i must take strong exception to the amendment offered by my chairman the gentleman from alabama however before i continue i would like to thank the gentleman from alabama for his fine efforts as chairman of the space science subcommittee the gentleman has done an excellent job it has been suggested here today and i would like to summarize a few points it has been suggested today that there are some parochial constituent interests and there are i do not think that comes as any shock or any surprise to anyone be it a boeing in seattle wash or a general dynamics in san diego calif or a marshall space center in huntsville ala put the parochial interests aside hecause the debate has been on the merits of this issue i would like to assure my colleagues that my opposition to this amendment is founded on sound principles of fiscal responisibility and wha i consider after a year and a half of intense study on the space subcommittee to be in the best interests of our civilian space program our telecommunications industry and our national security to begin let me offer a bit of pertinent upperstage history last year the space science subcommittee as you have heard directed nasa and the defense department to conduct a joint study to determine our needs for a high energy upper stage this is that study upper stage alternatives for the shuttle era a nasadod report to congress we have had it for over a year the study concluded that nasa should begin developing a centaur for space shuttle use since the reports completion nothing significantly has changed to warrant deleting centaur from nasas budget in fact on page 81 of this report that we commissioned it specifically rejects the end effect of the flippo amendment namely an ius galileo combined mission fortunately the president accepted the urgent supplemental last july 18 and sustained the funding for the centaur high energy upper stage integration into the shuttle the presidents acceptance is consistent with nasas 1982 authorization and appropriation bills and recognizes the technical superiority of centaur as well as the fact that centaur integration obviates the need for an otherwise redundant 1 to 11 billion for an air force high energy stage program for military and intelligence uses which we will have need for in the 1987 timeframe i would like to briefly outline four compelling reasons why the house should support the nasa air force recommendations and reject the flippo amendment first ius cannot meet our high energy upper stage requirements for nasa dod and commercial missions beyond the 198586 timeframe our high priority space missions are increasingly finding weight to be a limiting factor the ius can currently lift only 5 000 pounds compared to the 10 000 to 14 000 pounds provided by centaur second the failure to move decisively now to develop a high energy upper stage for shuttle will result in an increasing loss of business to foreign competition specifically the french ariane the ariane vehicle will lift approximately 9 500 pounds to geosynchronous orbit by 198687 thus exceeding ius capabilities without centaur the united states will lose this commercial market third development of a new high energy upper stage coupled with the decision to fly galileo and the international solar polar mission with an ius will cost taxpayers at least 700 million to 800 million more than centaur take at least 2 years longer to complete and yield no significant performance improvement indeed it has been estimated that a brandnew stage as i say will cost between 1 and 1 billion and will basically involve reinventing the centaur fourth and finally launching galileo and solar polar on centaur has a number of critical advantages over using ius for these missions centaur would provide a flight time of 26 months for nasas galileo mission and would guarantee 11 satellite encounters compared to a flight time of more than double 54 months and 6 satellite encounters for an ius launch plus the increased risk of the increased time in the case of solar polar centaur restores the maximum possible mission as well as nasas credibility with its foreign partners most notably the european space agency it is very likely that another change in launch vehicles will cause our international friends to question our resolve and ultimately conclude that nasa is an unreliable partner such an attitude may devastate our future plans for cooperative space ventures of the solar system"]]}
