matter of fact he was a friend to people all over the world i would like to tell the members why bill mote was born in my state of florida in the city of tampa at the turn of the century the world was a far different place for bill mote back in the early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers a vast one at that covering threefourths of the world to bill mote that was just as exciting as man landing on the moon discovering and protecting our oceans became his passion it is not surprising to people who knew bill to understand how his passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries ecology and enhancement at florida state university he also encouraged younger people to become interested in marine life schoolchildren were exposed to the smallest creatures as well as the magnificent sharks and dolphins at mote marine laboratories aquarium a new state of the art marine mammal rescue center gives all visitors a firsthand look at the expert veterinary care that motes marine biologists provide bill will always be remembered as a promoter of education as well as an excellent educator himself he was at the helm when the jason project began at mote marine that was developed as an educational venture between dr ballard and mote marine dr ballard is using jason and jason ii remote submersibles credited with the discoveries of the titanic the bismarck and other landmark discoveries beneath the depths of our oceans mr mote was constantly expanding the depths of our understanding even to the bottom of the sea even larger than his love of the oceans was his love for education he gave not only to the studies of marine biology and oceanography but also relentlessly promoted the fields to youth and professionals alike with his own special blend of enthusiasm in 1968 mr mote was awarded the gold medal of the international oceanographic foundation many of us who knew bill mote have our own stories to tell after meeting a person like bill his energetic and passionate love for the ocean was magnetic his relentless drive passion and vigor was rivaled only by his charismatic personality bill mote was to all of us and will remain in our hearts a true example of what one person can do with a little determination i served on the board of mote marine before i came to congress i had the pleasure of knowing bill mote well he was a devoted husband and brother he was a counselor to marine biologists

sat there in plain view of the police with a sign indicating if memory serves me that he had fought in the viet nam war but was not now receiving veterans benefits the guard there indicated it wasnt true but what struck me most was the fact that a single citizen could sit peacefully on the steps of the capitol without being escorted away because he was unworthy of the space he selected to rest there literally on the threshold of our nations mostpowerful leaders he sat other nations i thought might be embarrassed by the scene nevertheless i somehow felt that i had witnessedthere on the

years earlier when walking out of the starks building on what wasthen 4th and walnut he realized in a profound way that we are all one the church celebrated the 40th anniversary of that event with a simple mass and marker to me the service and the marker were both reminders that the ordinary space we sometimes occupy can become forever changed by the deeds of a person who stood there i am confident it was no accident that the church waited 40 years to commemorate the event my visit to washington and my attendance at the merton mass sparked a vision and a question in my mind wouldnt it be right to celebrate the 40th year of martin luther kings i have a dream speech with a ceremony and a marker at the footsteps of the lincoln memorial the anticipation and planning of such an event might lead to collective good in my minds eye i saw a day in which the i have a dream speech would be delivered again for those who have never heard it i saw a day in which martin luther king might be remembered for the inspiration he provided to all of our citizens looking even further into the future i saw a day when i could bring my yet unborn children to that spot where martin luther king spoke and i could show them that marker and read them the words of his dream i could tell him that this is still a nation where a simple kentucky farmer could rise to the heights of president and a son of a

is a problem but todays reformers hardly offer a solution the real problem is that government has too much influence over our economy and lives creating a tremendous incentive to protect ones own interests by investing in politicians the problem is not a lack of federal laws or rules regulating campaign spending therefore more laws wont help we hardly suffer from too much freedom any effort to solve the campaign finance problem with more laws will only make things worse by further undermining the principles of liberty and private property ownership the reformers are sincere in their effort to curtail special interest influence on govemment but this cannot be done while ignoring the control government has assumed over our lives and economy current reforms address only the symptoms while the root cause of the problem is ignored since reform efforts involve regulating political speech through control of political money personal liberty is compromised tough enforcement of spending rules will merely drive the influence underground since the stakes are too high and much is to be gained by exerting influence over government legal or not the more open and legal campaign expenditures are with disclosure the easier it is for voters to know whos buying influence from whom theres tremendous incentive for every special interest group to influence government every individual bank or corporation that does business with government invests plenty in influencing government lobbyists spend over a hundred million dollars per month trying to influence congress taxpayers dollars are endlessly spent by bureaucrats in their effort to convince congress to protect their own empires government has tremendous influence over the economy and financial markets through fnterest rate controls contracts regulations f6ans and grants cortorations and others are forced toparticipate in the process out of reed as well s selfdefeie since thats the way the system works equalizing competition and balancing power such as between labor and business is a common practice as long as this system remains in place the incentive to buy influence will continue many reformers recognize this and either like the system or believe that its futile to bring about changes and argue that curtailing influence is the only option left even if it involves compromising the liberty of political speech through regulating political money its naive to believe stricter rules will make a difference if enough honorable men and women served in congress and resisted the temptation to be influenced by any special interest group of course this whole discussion would be unnecessary because members do yield to the pressure the reformers believe that more rules regulating political speech will solve the problem the reformers argue that its only the fault of those trying to influence government and not the fault qf the members who yield to the pressure or the system that generates the abuse this allows members of congress to avoid assuming responsibility for their own acts and instead places the blame on those who exert pressure on congress through the political process which is a basic right bestowed on all americans the reformers argument is stop us before we succumb to the special interest groups politicians unable to accept this responsibility clamor for a system that diminishes the need for politicians to persuade individuals and groups to donate money to their campaign instead of persuasion they endorse coercing taxpayers to finance campaigns this only changes the special interest groups that control government policy instead of voluntary groups making their own decisions with their own money politicians and bureaucrats dictate how political campaigns will be financed not only will politicians and bureaucrats gain influence over elections other nondeservers will benefit clearly incumbents will greatly benefit by more controls over campaign spendinga benefit to which the reformers will never admit the media becomes a big winner their influence grows as private money is regulated it becomes more difficult to refute media propaganda both print and electronic when directed against a candidate if funds are limited campaigns are more likely to reflect the conventional wisdom and candidates will strive to avoid media attacks by accommodating their views the wealthy gain a significant edge since its clear candidates can spend unlimited personal funds in elections this is a big boost for the independently wealthy candidates over the average challenger who needs to raise and spend large funds to compete celebrities will gain even a greater benefit than they already enjoy celebrity status is money in the bank and by limiting the resources to counterbalance this advantage works against the noncelebrity who might be an issueoriented challenger this current reform effort ignores the legitimate and moral political action committees that exist only for good reasons and do not ask for any special benefit from government the immoral political action committees that work only to ripoff the taxpayers by getting benefits from government may deserve our condemnation but not the heavy hand of government anxious to control this group along with all the others the reformers see no difference between the two and are willing to violate all personal liberty since more regulating doesnt address the basic problem of influential government now out of control neither groups deserves more coercive government rules all the rules in the world cant prevent members from yielding to political pressure of the groups that donate to their campaigns regulation cannot instill character additionally the legislative debate over campaign finance reform has seemingly focused upon the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech as interpreted and applied by the courts the constitutional issues however are not limited to the first amendment to the contrary pursuant to their oaths of office members of congress have an independent duty to determine the constitutionality of legislation before it and to decide before ever reaching the first amendment whether they have been vested by the constitution with any authority at all to regulate federal election campaigns congress has no authority except that which is granted in the constitution thus the threshold question concoming h r 417 is whether the constitution has conferred upon congress any authority to regular federal election campaigns the authority to regulate such campaigns is not found among any enumerated power conferred upon congress more regulation of political speech through control of private money without addressing the subject of influential government only drives the money underground further giving a select group an advantage over the honest candidate who only wants smaller government true reform is not possible without changing the role of government which now exists to regulate tax subsidize and show preferential treatment only changing the nature of government will eliminate the motive for so many to invest so much in the political process but we

nothing to do with that the question here is whether or not the justice department violated the law itself in filing the lawsuit last year for the first time that i have ever recalled justice asked the congress for money to file a specific lawsuit the congress said no the money was denied justice then secretly went to three agencies and said give us the money to file this lawsuit they said wait a minute where is your authority for that they said well look at section 109 of the 1995 state commercejustice bill where it says that agencies can reimburse the justice department for representing them in court and they dragged the money out of those agencies and filed this lawsuit well that statute that they are talking about is the crux of what we are h50 talking about here today that statute merely says that the government can be represented in court when it is sued that was the intent of the congress no to be the suer no one told the congress that they had done this we had to find it out on our own and we did so the department of justice the place supposedly where the nations morals are protected the place where moral authority resides in this government if anywhere itself is the one that is thwarting the will of the congress that is twisting words for its own purposes that is clearly violating the intent of the congress in passing the act in the first place why was it passed in the first place the government was sued a huge multibillion dollar suit by the contractor for the navy department when we canceled the a12 aircraft contract in 1995 justice says please congress help us allow the defense department to pay us back for representing them in defending this lawsuit and we said we think that is a legitimate purpose and we wrote it into our bill that is the statute they are trying to use we all know my colleagues know that that statute is for defending the government not suing willynilly why because we provided in this bill 147 million for them to bring lawsuits 1 034 lawyers we hire there to file lawsuits we are paying those lawyers to file lawsuits this statute is for defending the government not suing and yet they would have us believe that this great moral authority at the justice department is right i say to my colleagues the question here is not the merits of the lawsuit or any other lawsuit the question here is the merits of the morality at the justice department does the end justify the means they say yes i say no is this a nation of laws or of men i say laws and the congress better say laws theyare taking your prerogative here down there and they are using it as they choose i say to my colleagues reject the justice departments grab of other agencies money but more importantly the justice departments seizure of power away from the congress never was it intended in this congress in the passage of this statute that it was to be funding lawsuits filed by the government no one ever anticipated that or thought about it when we passed the act the intent of the congress is being clarified in our bill and that is this statute is for defensive purposes only reject the waxman amendment that would legitimize and reward a justice department that has seized your prerogative and is acting like they are the law themselves and we do not matter well the end does not justify the these means i urge my colleagues to tell the justice department to obey the law"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "earlier this week i was discussing the war supplemental and some of my concerns about this administrations approach to the war in yugoslavia and kosovo i found the most disturbing thing underneath the premise that the administration is pushing and why i have such deep concerns about this entire effort sandy berger the national security adviser told our republican conference during some questioning that he said we want to teach the world a new way to live in peace they also said they wanted to show the world a new way to fight the war my concern is that the dindergirding of this entire foreign policy is a kind of a liberal humanitarian what would be with quotes around it a secular humanist approach that we can somehow teach people to live together ironically through bombing them and i do not fully understand but that was not our intent but we look at the evils that were going on with milosevic much like the evils that were going on in croatia and other ethnic cleansing efforts not only in the balkans but in africa and other parts of the world and we say correctly people should not live that way but then we think based on kind of our humanitarian tradition in the united states that we can just walk in and say you know for 700 years for 1 000 years for 2 000 years you have been wrong we want you to change if you do not change we are going to bomb you into change life does not work that way if this is the supposition under our foreign policy that somehow we can walk into africa and say change the way you have behaved for all these years if we can walk into haiti and say we are going to put a government in and now you are going to change if we can walk into bosnia and say now we are going to do a dayton line and we want you all to behave and if we are going to go into serbia and say this is terrible we want you to live in peace together it simply is not going to work i was in the camp near skopje montenegro and talked to many of the kosovars as one of the senators asked them they said will you go back and live at peace in yugoslavia under the serbians absolutely not we are going to get rid of milosevic milosevic will not be there they said all serbs are milosevic what do you mean all serbs you lived with them before yes but they slit my neighbors throat they burned my house they raped my daughters you heard all kinds of the variations of stories they are not interested in living with peace the idea that suddenly we are going to wave a wand have a sitdown conference here and everybody in the world is going to live in peace is a very dangerous undergirding pressure for foreign policy just yesterday in the washington times based on a senate hearing secretary cohen said we have got to find a way to either increase the size of our forces or decrease the number of our missions now in the standard colloquial phrase right now in the united states you would say well duh i mean we have to find a way to either increase the sizeof our forces or decrease the number of our missions do we mean it is finally dawning on this administration that we cannot take a declining armed forces and send them all over the world to try to change people through exhortation when we are not willing to stand up which it is not necessary that this would work either but it is the only way we would get peace is that if we believe as the judeochristian principles teach that man is born of sin and of selfinterest and unless there is a transforming power in their hearts they are not going to suddenly change going in and saying it is in your selfinterest not to have war that is not necessarily true it is not necessarily good for kosovars to let the serbians have pristina and the mineral rights in the north part of this country it is not necessarily in the selfinterest of the serbians to let the kosovars have the mineral rights and the seminaries in pristina for their heritage they both argue over

federal funds they received mainly to local agencies it continues excluding the 7 3 billion title i program one of the largest elementary secondary education programs the overall percentage of funds states allocated to local agencies by the remaining 9 programs was 86 percent i could read more but that is the quote used in the resolution also he mentioned the local administrators not complaining let me give my colleagues a quote from my school superintendent when he came to present testimony before the committee on education and the workforce he said the direct funding of dollars for classroom teachers use would put the money in the hands of the people who would make the difference in districts like ours who better to decide what is needed in his or her classroom than the teacher another one dr linder shingo a superintendent from georgia administrators from washington will never meet the needs of individual children i cast my vote for returning as many dollars directly to the local schools as we are able less bureaucracy on all levels would allow more dollars to directly reach the students in the classroom in addition one of the administrators said they do not even bother applying for the federal funds because ofthe administrative requirements and the costs to them in the local level and the paperwork and the procedure necessary to apply for the federal funds but let me go ahead and say that i rise in support strong support of the dollars to the classroom resolution today an effort on which we have been working for a couple of years to ensure that our federal elementary and secondary education dollars get to where they belong in the classroom of our public schools where teachers who know a childs name has some control over the money overall not a lot a high percentage of our schools funding is from thefederal government most of it is state and local government funds but about 6 to 7 percent does come from the federal government and this is about in a day of tightening tax dollars the need for more efficient and effective use of our tax dollars currently as i mentioned it is estimated and depending on the programs some more some less but it is estimated from between 65 to 86 percent of the federal education dollars make it to the classroom for educational purposes regardless of the exact amount that is not enough it is no secret that funds designated for the education of our kids are wasted when they are not funneled down to the level where they can actually play a supportive role in classroom activities and instead they are often funneled off by bureaucracies at all levels the importance of this dollars to the classroom resolution todayis that we should set a standard to re duce bureaucratic and ineffective spending we should work to get more money into the local classroom we should prioritize the way we spend our education tax dollars and put children first this is about the kids this is for them we must get the dollars down to where they benefit where the action is into the classroom and our kids deserve to be the prime beneficiaries of federal funding this resolution calls on federal state and local agencies to ensure that 95 percent of the funds are used for classroom activities and services what could this mean for our kids first it would signal an important systemic shift in how federal education dollars can be delivered to our nations schools it could mean more books more textbooks i have had students from my district share that their textbooks are in some cases older than their teachers in the words of an eighth grader who was here last year and who spoke he said quote our geographybooks are from the 1980s a lot has happened in the world since then instead of calling the books geography today they should be called geography of the world 15 years ago end quote 1615 that is a pretty astute comment for an eighth grader more dollars to the classroom could also mean more teachers more teacher aides this money could be used for teachers salaries more dollars to the classroom could mean new computers computer soft ware even microscopes so that students have new opportunities of discovery in science and physics and mathematics it is a littleknown fact that most public schoolteachers now dip into their own pockets to provfde supplies for their classrooms sometimes spending hundreds and

people working 40 hours a week for one full year if we are honestly going to discuss our priorities in federal funding of elementary and secondary education we must ask why so much funding goes to the bureaucracy instead of going right to the kids in the classroom with the dollars to the classroom resolution we aim to put priority back on our kids this is a goal on which we all can agree we should vote for the dollars to the classroom resolution recognizing that local schools not bureaucracies are best suited to make deci sions about allocating resources they understand their students

the academic achievement for all students freedom and accountability act straight as while this bill does increase the ability of state and local governments to educate children free from federal mandates and regulations and is thus a marginal improvement over existing federal law straight as fails to challenge the federal governments unconstitutional control of education in fact under straight as states and local school districts will still be treated as administrative subdivisions of the federal education bureaucracy furthermore this bill does not remove the myriad requirements imposed on states and local school districts by federal bureaucrats in the name of promoting civil rights thus a school district participating in straight as will still have to place children in failed bilingual education programs or face the wrath of the department of educations misnamed office of civil rights the fact that this bill increases however marginally the ability of states and localities to control education is a step forward as long as the federal government continues to levy oppressive taxes on the american people and then funnel that money back to the states to use for education programs defenders of the constitution should support all efforts to reduce the hoops through which states must jump in order to reclaim some of the peoples tax monies however there are a number of both practical and philosophical concerns regarding this bill while the additional flexibility granted under this bill will be welcomed by the ten states allowed by the federal overseers to participate in the program there is no justification to deny this flexibility to the remaining forty states after all federal education money represents the return of funds illegitimately taken from the american taxpayers to their states and communities it is the pinnacle of arrogance for congress to pick and choose which states are worthy of relief from federal strings in how they use what is after all the peoples money the primary objection to straight as from a constitutional viewpoint is embedded in the very mantra of accountability stressed by the drafters of the bill talk of accountability begs the question accountable to whom under this bill schools remain accountable to federal bureaucrats and those who develop the state tests upon which a participating schools performance is judged should the schools not live up to their bureaucraticallydetermined performance goals they will lose the flexibility granted to them under this act so federal and state bureaucrats will determine if the schools are to be allowed to participate in the straight as programs and bureaucrats will judge whether the states are living up to the standards set in the states fiveyear education planyet this is supposed to debureaucratize and decentralize education under the united states constitution the federal government has no authority to hold states accountable for their education performance in the free society envisioned by the founders schools are held accountable to parents not federal bureaucrats however the current system of leveling oppressive taxes on americas families and using those taxes to fund federal education programs denies parental control of education by denying them control over the education dollar because hewho pays the piper calls the tune when the federal government controls the education dollar schools will obey the dictates of federal educrats while ignoring the wishes of the parents in order to provide parents with the means to hold schools accountable i have introduced the family education freedom act the family education freedom act restores parental control over the classroom by providing american parents a tax credit of up to 3 000 for the expenses incurred in sending their child to private public parochial other religious school or for home schooling their children the family education freedom act returns the fundamental principal of a truly free economy to americas education system what the great economist ludwig von mises called consumer sovereignty consumer sovereignty simply means consumers decide who succeeds or fails in the market businesses that best satisfy consumer demand will be the most successful consumer sovereignty is the means by which the free society maximizes human happiness when parents control the education dollar schools must be responsive to parental demands that their children receive firstclass educations otherwise parents will find alternative means to educate their children furthermore parents whose children are in public schools may use their credit to improve their schools by helping tcr finance the purchase of educational tools such as computers or extracurricular activities such as music programs parents of public school students may also wish to use the credit to pay for special serv ices for their children it is the family education freedom act not straight as which represents the education policy best suited for a constitutional republic and a free society the family education freedom act ensures that schools are accountable to parents whereas straight as continues to hold schools accountable to bureaucrats since the straight as bill does give states an opportunity to break free of some federal mandates supporters of returning the federal government to its constitutional limits should support it however they should keep in mind that this bill represents a minuscule step forward as it fails to directly challenge the federal governments usurpation of control over education instead this bill merely gives states greater flexibility to fulfill federallydefined goals therefore congress should continue to work to restore constitutional govemment and parental control of education by defunding all unconstitutional federal programs and returning the money to americas parents so that they may once again control the

of the century the world was a far different place for bill mote back in the early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers a vast one at that covering threefourths of the

passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries

suffer from too much freedom any effort to solve the campaign finance problem with more laws will only make things worse by further undermining the principles of liberty and private property ownership the reformers are sincere in their effort to curtail special interest influence on govemment but this cannot be done while ignoring the control government has assumed over our lives and economy current reforms address only the symptoms while the root cause of the problem is ignored since reform efforts involve regulating political speech through control of political money personal liberty is compromised tough enforcement of spending rules will merely drive the influence underground since the stakes are too high and much is to be gained by exerting influence over government legal or not the more open and legal campaign expenditures are with disclosure the easier it is for voters to know whos buying influence from whom theres tremendous incentive for every special interest group to influence government every individual bank or corporation that does business with government invests plenty in influencing government lobbyists spend over a hundred million dollars per month trying to influence congress taxpayers dollars are endlessly spent by bureaucrats in their effort to convince congress to protect their own empires government has tremendous influence over the economy and financial markets through fnterest rate controls contracts regulations f6ans and grants cortorations and others are forced toparticipate in the process out of reed as well s selfdefeie since thats the way the system works equalizing competition and balancing power such as between labor and business is a common practice as long as this system remains in place the incentive to buy influence will continue many reformers recognize this and either like the system or believe that its futile to bring about changes and argue that curtailing influence is the only option left even if it involves compromising the liberty of political speech through regulating political money its naive to believe stricter rules will make a difference if enough honorable men and women served in congress and resisted the temptation to be influenced by any special interest group of course this whole discussion would be unnecessary because members do yield to the pressure the reformers believe that more rules regulating political speech will solve the problem the reformers argue that its only the fault of those trying to influence government and not the fault qf the members who yield to the pressure or the system that generates the abuse this allows members of congress to avoid assuming responsibility for their own acts and instead places the blame on those who exert pressure on congress through the political process which is a basic right bestowed on all americans the reformers argument is stop us before we succumb to the special interest groups politicians unable to accept this responsibility clamor for a system that diminishes the need for politicians to persuade individuals and groups to donate money to their campaign instead of persuasion they endorse coercing taxpayers to finance campaigns this only changes the special interest groups that control government policy instead of voluntary groups making their own decisions with their own money politicians and bureaucrats dictate how political campaigns will be financed not only will politicians and bureaucrats gain influence over elections other nondeservers will benefit clearly incumbents will greatly benefit by more controls over campaign spendinga benefit to which the reformers will never admit the media becomes a big winner their influence grows as private money is regulated it becomes more difficult to refute media propaganda both print and electronic when directed against a candidate if funds are limited campaigns are more likely to reflect the conventional wisdom and candidates will strive to avoid media attacks by accommodating their views the wealthy gain a significant edge since its clear candidates can spend unlimited personal funds in elections this is a big boost for the independently wealthy candidates over the average challenger who needs to raise and spend large funds to compete celebrities will gain even a greater benefit than they already enjoy celebrity status is money in the bank and by limiting the resources to counterbalance this advantage works against the noncelebrity who might be an issueoriented challenger this current reform effort ignores the legitimate and moral political action committees that exist only for good reasons and do not ask for any special benefit from government the immoral political action committees that work only to ripoff the taxpayers by getting benefits from government may deserve our condemnation but not the heavy hand of government anxious to control this group along with all the others the reformers see no difference between the two and are willing to violate all personal liberty since more regulating doesnt address the basic problem of influential government now out of control neither groups deserves more coercive government rules all the rules in the world cant prevent members from yielding to political pressure of the groups that donate to their campaigns regulation cannot instill character additionally the legislative debate over campaign finance reform has seemingly focused upon the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech as interpreted and applied by the courts the constitutional issues however are not limited to the first amendment to the contrary pursuant to their oaths of office members of congress have an independent duty to determine the constitutionality of legislation before it and to decide before ever reaching the first amendment whether they have been vested by the constitution with any authority at all to regulate federal election campaigns congress has no authority except that which is granted in the constitution thus the threshold question concoming h r 417 is whether the constitution has conferred upon congress any authority to regular federal election campaigns the authority to regulate such campaigns is not found among any enumerated power conferred upon congress more regulation of political speech through control of private money without addressing the subject of influential government only drives the money underground further giving a select group an advantage over the honest candidate who only wants smaller

of the congress no to be the suer no one told the congress that they had done this we had to find it out on our own and we did so the department of justice the place supposedly where the nations morals are protected the place where moral authority resides in this government if anywhere itself is the one that is thwarting the will of the congress that is twisting words for its own purposes

contractor for the navy department when we canceled the a12 aircraft contract in 1995 justice says please congress help us allow the defense department to pay us back for representing them in defending this lawsuit and we said we think that is a legitimate purpose and we wrote it into our bill that is the statute they are trying to use we all know my colleagues know that that statute is for defending the government not suing willynilly why because we provided in this bill 147 million for them to bring lawsuits 1 034 lawyers we hire there to file lawsuits we are paying those lawyers to file lawsuits this statute is for defending the government not suing and yet they would have us believe that this great moral authority at the justice department is right i say to my colleagues the

that is this statute is for defensive purposes only reject the waxman amendment that would legitimize and reward a justice department that has seized your prerogative and is acting like they are the

discussing the war supplemental and some of my concerns about this administrations approach to the war in yugoslavia and kosovo i found the most disturbing thing underneath the premise that the administration is pushing and why i have such deep concerns about this entire effort sandy berger the national security adviser told our republican conference during some questioning that he said we want to teach the world a new way to live in peace they also said they wanted to show the world a new way to fight the war my concern is that the dindergirding of this entire foreign policy is a kind of a liberal humanitarian what would be with quotes around it a secular humanist approach that we can somehow teach people to live together ironically through bombing them and i do not fully understand but that was not our intent but we look at the evils that were going on with milosevic much like the evils that were going on in croatia and other ethnic cleansing efforts not only in the balkans but in africa and other parts of the world and we say correctly people should not live that way but then we think based on kind of our humanitarian tradition in the united states that we can just walk in and say you know for 700 years for 1 000 years for 2 000 years you have been wrong we want you to change if you do not change we are going to bomb you into change life does not work that way if this is the supposition under our foreign policy that somehow we can walk into africa and say change the way you have behaved for all these years if we can walk into haiti and say we are going to put a government in and now you are going to change if we can walk into bosnia and say now we are going to do a dayton line and we want you all to behave and if we are going to go into serbia and say this is terrible we want you to live in peace together it simply is not going to work i was in the camp near skopje montenegro and talked to many of the kosovars as one of the senators asked them they said will you go back and live at peace in yugoslavia under the serbians absolutely not we are going to get rid of milosevic milosevic will not be there they said all serbs are milosevic what do you mean all serbs you lived with them before yes but they slit my neighbors throat they burned my house they raped my daughters you heard all kinds of the variations of stories they are not interested in living with peace the idea that suddenly we are going to wave a wand have a sitdown conference here and everybody in the world is going to live in peace is a very dangerous undergirding pressure for foreign policy just yesterday in the washington times based on a senate hearing secretary cohen said we have got to find a way to either increase the size of our forces or decrease the number of our missions now in the standard colloquial phrase right now in the united states you would say well duh i mean we have to find a way to either increase the sizeof our forces or decrease the number of our missions do we mean it is finally dawning on this administration that we cannot take a declining armed forces and send them all over the world to try to change people through exhortation when we are not willing to stand up which it is not necessary that this would work either but it is the only way we would get peace is that if we believe as the judeochristian principles teach that man is born of sin and of selfinterest and unless there is a transforming power in their hearts they are not going to suddenly change going in and saying it is in your selfinterest not to have war that is not necessarily true it is not necessarily good for kosovars to let the serbians have pristina and the mineral rights in the north part of this country it is not necessarily in the selfinterest of the serbians to let the kosovars have the mineral rights and the seminaries in pristina for their heritage they both argue over that you cannot just use the pleasurepain principles or positivist principles or some kind of humanist principles furthermore if we are going to get back to that the renaissance did not occur in a lot of the parts of the world where we have our humanist traditions unless you have whatever religious tradition it is that reforms peoples hearts and peoples thinking that there is a higher power we are not going to have a real peace if we are not going to have a real peace we certainly are not going to force it through bombing and the danger of our current foreign policy is that we are going around the world threatening and trying to reform it when we do not have the traditional criteria of how and when we wage war was there a sovereign nation invading another sovereign nation was there a threat to the national interest of the united states was there a tiein that we can actually deal with and win these are deep religious and moral questions and they are not going to be solved by the type of bombing we are doing"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "earlier this year allen greenspan appeared before one of our committees here on capitol hill and he made it clear that increased spending was the worst option for using the budget surplus we have today he said very clearly that the first thing we should do is pay down the public debt he said and i quote if that proves politically infeasible i would opt for cutting taxes this nation has a public debt of over 3 trillion how much is 1 trillion if we borrowed 1 million a day 7 days a week every year and we began on the day jesus christ was born and went until now we would not yet have 1 trillion we have the opportunity right now to pay off the public debt and that is what our republican congress wants to do but the big spenders say we are not spending enough the president wants 40 billion more than we have appropriated even though every dollar we do not pay off as debt our children will have to pay interest on is there any end to the clintongore administrations thirst for big government spending"],

resolution and all education reform i just want to mention first of all in response to the gentleman from missouri who cited a gao report that he did not continue reading from the report i have a copy of it here let me continue reading what he failed to read after saying that collectively the states distributed 94 percent of the federal funds they received mainly to local agencies it continues excluding the 7 3 billion title i program one of the largest elementary secondary education programs the overall percentage of funds states allocated to local agencies by the remaining 9 programs was 86 percent i could read more but that is the quote used in the resolution also he mentioned the local administrators not complaining let me give my colleagues a quote from my school superintendent when he came to present testimony before the committee on education and the workforce he said the direct funding of dollars for classroom teachers use would put the money in the hands of the people who would make the difference in districts like ours who better to decide what is needed in his or her classroom than the teacher another one dr linder shingo a superintendent from georgia administrators from washington will never meet the needs of individual children i cast my vote for returning as many dollars directly to the local schools as we are able less bureaucracy on all levels would allow more dollars to directly reach the students in the classroom in addition one of the administrators said they do not even bother applying for the federal funds because ofthe administrative requirements and the costs to them in the local level and the paperwork and the procedure necessary to apply for the federal funds but let me go ahead and say that i rise in support strong support of the dollars to the classroom resolution today an effort on which we have been working for a couple of years to ensure that our federal elementary and secondary education dollars get to where they belong in the classroom of our public schools where teachers who know a childs name has some control over the money overall not a lot a high percentage of our schools funding is from thefederal government most of it is state and local government funds but about 6 to 7 percent does come from the federal government and this is about in a day of tightening tax dollars the need for more efficient and effective use of our tax dollars currently as i mentioned it is estimated and depending on the programs some more some less but it is estimated from between 65 to 86 percent of the federal education dollars make it to the classroom for educational purposes regardless of the exact amount that is not enough it is no secret that funds designated for the education of our kids are wasted when they are not funneled down to the level where they can actually play a supportive role in classroom activities and instead they are often funneled off by bureaucracies at all levels the importance of this dollars to the classroom resolution todayis that we should set a standard to re duce bureaucratic and ineffective spending we should work to get more money into the local classroom we should prioritize the way we spend our education tax dollars and put children first this is about the kids this is for them we must get the dollars down to where they benefit where the action is into the classroom and our kids deserve to be the prime beneficiaries of federal funding this resolution calls on federal state and local agencies to ensure that 95 percent of the funds are used for classroom activities and services what could this mean for our kids first it would signal an important systemic shift in how federal education dollars can be delivered to our nations schools it could mean more books more textbooks i have had students from my district share that their textbooks are in some cases older than their teachers in the words of an eighth grader who was here last year and who spoke he said quote our geographybooks are from the 1980s a lot has happened in the world since then instead of calling the books geography today they should be called geography of the world 15 years ago end quote 1615 that is a pretty astute comment for an eighth grader more dollars to the classroom could also mean more teachers more teacher aides this money could be used for teachers salaries more dollars to the classroom could mean new computers computer soft ware even microscopes so that students have new opportunities of discovery in science and physics and mathematics it is a littleknown fact that most public schoolteachers now dip into their own pockets to provfde supplies for their classrooms sometimes spending hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year yet consider this fact according to the general accounting office study in fiscal year 1993 federal education dollars funded 13 397 fulltime equivalent positions in state education agencies in fiscal year 1998 the department of educations paperwork and data reporting requirements totaled 40 million of what they call burden hours which is the equivalent of 19 300 people working 40 hours a week for one full year if we are honestly going to discuss our priorities in federal funding of elementary and secondary education we must ask why so much funding goes to the bureaucracy instead of going right to the kids in the classroom with the dollars to the classroom resolution we aim to put priority back on our kids this is a goal on which we all can agree we should vote for the dollars to the classroom resolution recognizing that local schools not bureaucracies are best suited to make deci sions about allocating resources they understand their students backgrounds their needs they can respond to them most directly with proven methods of instructions we should trust the parents and our teachers and our public schools to use money to meet their unique needs vote for the dollars to the classroom resolution i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
