the dangers involved our nations security could only be ensured if the committees chairman was a man of great wisdom a man of unwavering patriotism and a man of unquestionable integrity tip oneill did decide to create the intelligence oversight coinmittee because he knew he had just the right man for the job he turned to the man we commemorate here today congressman edward patrick boland from the second congressional district of massachusetts its been a great honor for me to serve alongside eddie during the last 30 years in the congress i can say without hesitation that ive never known a more trustworthy and reasonable man than eddie he has anchored this institution to the fundamental virtues of good government and i am proud to have served with him in the house i am even more proud to have counted him as a good good friend eddies life story is a very familiar one in massachusetts politics hes a first generation americanborn to irish immigrants he w s raised in hungry hill a working class neighborhood in springfield he graduated from boston college he served in the state house and hes a good catholic but eddie didnt fit the mold he helped cast the mold eddies accomplishments here in the congress are remarkable he has emerged as one of the most hardworking and responsible members of the house appropriations committee as chairman of the hudindependent agencies subcommittee during the last 17 years eddie has been confronted with the most challenging and difficult questions offered by any chairmanship in the congress he must balance national housing priorities with the growing space program ie must balance this nations sacred commitment to its veterans with our commitment to the environment and he must balance community development goals with hazardous waste management at a time of record budget deficits eddie has been put in an unenviable position yet his accomplishments are many when millions of americans watched the space shuttle discovery go up last week and land this morning they were watching the fruits of eddie bolands labor eddie has guided the space program to new highs and he has also provided guidance during the programs most profound lows and while he plans for our future in space eddie places a strong emphasis on the importance of this nations past as a member of the smithsonian institutions board of regents during eddies tenure in the congress he has witnessed the national sorrow over the death of one president and the scandal caused by the resignation of another he served during the racial tensions of the sixties and during the war in vietnam he has worked to implement the human needs programs of the great society and to nurture the economic growth of the eighties eddie boland has a deep understanding and respect for the history of this great nation and im delighted that hell continue to serve with me at the smithsonian nowhere are eddies accomplishments more remarkable than in springfield ma the city of springfield

think of no better honor for eddie a man who prefers that this triumphs appear on the front pages while his name does not eddie has been selfless in his work in the congress last summers irancontra hearings are testament to that eddie worked long and hard as a member of the select committee and as the author of the statute in question yet eddie didnt use the occasion for personal gain as he very well could have he got the job done his work here transcends personal ambition and that has earned him the respect of all the people of massachusetts and especially those from the second congressional

small he has served and protected the people of massachusetts i will miss eddie here in the congress eddie is much more than a colleaguewere like brothers and like brothers rivalries have developed over the years because we work so closely on a number of issues weve worked equally hard to ensure that were not confused you dont have to be a careful observer to notice that we dont always use the same style to get things done but as we all know one brother doesnt like to be mistaken for another but also like brothers i cant imaginc working in the congress without eddie i share a strong and silent bond with eddie that i know can never be replaced through all the comings and goings of our lives eddie and i have always been there for each other and i know that wont change with eddies

disturbing editorial about soviet abm activities breakout february 25 1988 based on a highly classified air force intelligence report the colunm concluded that the soviets are actively moving toward deployment of a nationwide antimissile system and a complete breakout of the abm treaty all members of congressregardless of which side of the aisle they sit on regardless of their approach to achieving true arms reductionsshould be troubled by these findings troubled not only by the assessment about soviet abm activity but the way they learned about those findings referring to the abm findings in the tightly held intelligence report the wall street journal wrote our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought to conduct an onsite inspection the journals findings bear out an earlier statement by robert gates deputy director of the cia who said we are very concerned that the soviets continuing development efforts give them the potential for widespread abm deployments well in excess of the abm limits it is our job to prepare the national defense authorization that means determining sdi spending levels and helping shape strategic defense policies we also seem to be increasingly involved in shaping arms control policy if were going to do our job right we should get to the bottom of these findings as the wsj editorial says perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves if the house is going to make rational informed decisions about the unitedstates nuclear force and sdi and it is going to insist on involving itself in arms control policy then it has an equal responsibility to learn more about the air force inteiligence findings it is critical that we fully understand soviet strategic defense activities for that reason i have offered an amendment included in the chairmans en bloc amendment which will require the secretary of dod to provide a classified and unclassified report on soviet abm and abmrelated activities unfortunately the house did not have access to a full brief on this matter in time for this years authorization but with adoption of my amendment we will have this information to guide us next year i know that my colleagues share my desire to have a better understanding of soviet strategic defense actions intentions and capabilities and i urge their support for this amendment i include the following article from the wall street journal of february 25 1988 breakout our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought t conduct an onsite inspection we hear that air force intelligence has officially concluded the soviets have rolled production lines to break out of the abm treaty and deploy a nationwide antimissile system which possibly could be in place by next year that maj gen schuyler bissel head of air force intelligence briefed the cia on this conclusion late last week and that the finding is based on two new pieces of evidence first the soviets are internetting their earlywarning radars with interceptorguidance radars they have conducted handoff exercises in which the large phasedarray radars like the controversial one at krasnoyarsk pick up targets and alert the flat twin and pawn shop mobile radars that guide their sh04 and sii08 antimissile interceptors this is the key battle management function of an antimissile system second the soviets are mass producing the flat twin and pawn shop radars though the abm treaty limits them to two locations similarly they are mass producing the s1108 a relatively new supersonic missile that intercepts warheads within the atmosphere with 500 such missiles already produced and 3 000 ultimately projected the abm treaty limits each side to only 100 interceptors of all types and the soviets also have the si104 which intercepts above the atmosphere as well as other interceptors with both antiaircraft and antimissile capability while rich in detail our reports admittedly have not been from direct participants in these briefings we now find that the new york tribune the unification church paper in new york published substantially the same reports on monday quoting a senior military intelligence official an official conclusion that the soviets are breaking out of the abm treaty to be sure only would put an official stamp on what has been apparent all along the soviets have taken full advantage of treaty provisions allowing large radars at one abm site at missile test ranges and on the periphery of the nation to finish the job they simply ignored these restrictions to build at krasnoyarsk see map adapted from the pentagons soviet military power the administration has cited the krasnoyarsk radar as an outright violation and both houses of congress have voted their agreement the administration also has protested the deployment of flat twin and pawn shop radars at gomel beyond the sites permitted at the sary shagan and kamchatka test ranges in his compliance report to congress in december president reagan said the absence of soviet dismantlement of the krasnoyarsk radar the new violation in the deployment of the flat twin and pawn shop observed at gomel and the totality of soviet abmrelated activities in 1987 and previous years suggest that the ussr may be preparing an abm defense of its national territory these are the words of course of the same administration that currently has a new inf treaty before the senate and has just had its secretary of state in moscow pushing a new strategic arms treaty in time for the impending moscow summit a breakout finding would be of monumental importance to these enterprises on arms control in general the prospect of a soviet abm breakout raises once again the question of why we are negotiating new treaties with them when they are breaking the old ones on the proposed 50 reduction in offensive arms in particular the soviet abm technology is not star wars it is groundbased and many analysts think each interceptor carries a nuclear warhead so that highly accurate guidance is not needed but with our offensive weapons limited by treaty and with no defense of our own against a soviet first strike our deterrent could be significantly degraded even by this 1970s technology perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves certainly anyone as preocupied with the exegesis of

violation of the abm from the washington times dated april 29 1987 we have soviet general boris surikov who has been quoted as saying although i must say in territorial terms the location of the krasnoyarsk facility is not adequate and therefore we can interpret is in violation of the abm treaty so to all of these other comments i now can say that we have on the record a soviet general who has even acknowledged that krasnoyarsk violates a treaty which we debated very heavily yesterday the purpose of my amendment today is to very simply allow this body to go on record individually and as

first of all say that the bills sponsors and advocates maintain that the bill is liabilityneutral at this point and is blocked off from worker compensation claims of this sort they argue that it is based on the fact that the notice itself that would be received from a government agency or as the bill does allow the notice which would be received from the employer by the worker says dear mr jones or dear miss jones or dear miss smith we wish to inform you that during certain years of your employment you were exposed to this chemical or hazard in the workplace and we wish to tell you at this point that you should be advised that some certain degree of risk is attendant to you because of that exposure that notice whether it comes from the government agency or the employer the notice itself as a piece of paper as i understand the legislation being proposed could not be introduced in the evidentiary record however the fact is the notice could be introduced because obviously the fact of notice could not be denied in any evidentiary hearing not only would this person be allowed to sue for stress if in fact he or she truly suffered stress in a physiological sense from the notice but the person would have standing in many states such as michigan simply because he or she believes he is suffering stress from that notice here is the important thing when we are talking about retroactive risk notifications statistically the overwhelming number of people notified will in effect have no true health hazard consequent to the risk to which they had been exposed but in fact you are going to be notifying statistically probably 995 people who have had no ill effects for the exposure for every 5 that have so instead of going after the 5and of course the problem here is identifying those 5 but you are opening up yourself to this tremendous amount of litigation relative to the 995 that will not have experienced any ill health or stress in order to adequately compensate the 5 we should also point out that the 5 if in fact they do have some ill consequence as a result of their exposure gain no standing in law that they do not already have under workers compensation or subrogated liability claims against a product or an employer so there is no new protection to the worker that is injured but a host of liability problems to those who are suffering stress or believe they are suffering stress i might add that we have heard from professionals in occupational health who stressed to the committee members over and over again that the fact of notification can indeed create a stress environment and a stress environment is often a contributory factor to susceptibility to environmental disease so the fact that the notification may in fact statistically because of the way in which these numbers spread may in fact generate more claims in true illnesses than would otherwise be the case without the notification that generates the stress which in turn generates susceptibility to occupational disease"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "yes i yield myself such time as i may consume i hope that the motion on the previous question will be voted on

proposed to be offered by the gentleman from california we are establishing a very bad precedent if we go down the route he proposes in essence we would by the route of the motion to instruct be instructing our conferees to do something which the house itself could not have done during the ordinary consideration of this bill let me explain that point the amendment which the gentleman from california has at the desk is twofold it would first instruct us to give way to the socalled nickles amendment that provides that none of the funds can be obligated or expended after december 31 1988 unless the district repeals a law that is now on its books that is a law dealing with the ability of insurers to require testing of applicants for insurance with respect to the aids virus now i have very serious doubts that that kind of an amendment offered to this bill on the floor of this house could withstand a point of order for the obvious reason that it would be legislating on an appropriation bill to require further acts on the part of the district government before the district government could get its appropriation i think there would be serious question whether that could stand the scrutiny of the chair and of the parliamentarian the other amendment that is offered is the socalled armstrong amendment again stating that the funds appropriated by the act cannot be obligated or expended after december 31 1988 if by that date the district of columbia still has not adopted a law that law in essence would reverse a court decision the d c appellate court decision with respect to the rights of certain groups at georgetown university let me emphasize that the dannemeyer amendment at least as it was given to me before we began this debate by the gentleman from california and i appreciate his courtesydoes not have anything to do with abortion at this juncture i should also add that i am informed that georgetown university has stated publicly that it did not ask that the armstrong amendment be introduced although the court case relates to georgetown university so this is not something that is being done at the request of georgetown university and i hope everyone understands that so i simply say to my colleagues that not only are we being asked to act with no committee hearings no serious discussions on two very complex matters a matter of insurance reguation and a matter of the rights of students at educational institutions but in addition to that we are being asked to do so in a way that i very seriously doubt could have been done in the form of an amendment offered to this bill when it came up for consideration on the floor of the house i think that is a very bad way to go about our business and i therefore hope that the members would

have counted him as a good good friend eddies life story is a very familiar one in massachusetts politics hes a first generation americanborn to irish immigrants he w s raised in hungry hill a working class neighborhood in springfield he graduated from boston college he served in the state house and hes a good catholic but eddie didnt fit the mold he helped cast the mold eddies accomplishments here in the congress are remarkable he has emerged as one of the most hardworking and responsible members of the house appropriations committee as chairman of the hudindependent agencies subcommittee during the last 17 years eddie has been confronted with the most challenging and difficult questions offered by any chairmanship in the congress he must balance national housing priorities with the growing space program ie must balance this nations sacred commitment to its veterans with our commitment to the environment and he must balance community development goals with hazardous waste management at a time of record budget deficits eddie has been put in an unenviable position yet his accomplishments are many when millions of americans watched the space shuttle discovery go up last week and land this morning they were watching the fruits of eddie bolands labor eddie has guided the space program to new highs and he has also provided guidance during the programs most profound lows

disturbing editorial about soviet abm activities breakout february 25 1988 based on a highly classified air force intelligence report the colunm concluded that the soviets are actively moving toward deployment of a nationwide antimissile system and a complete breakout of the abm treaty all members of congressregardless of which side of the aisle they sit on regardless of their approach to achieving true arms reductionsshould be troubled by these findings troubled not only by the assessment about soviet abm activity but the way they learned about those findings referring to the abm findings in the tightly held intelligence report the wall street journal wrote our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought to conduct an onsite inspection the journals findings bear out an earlier statement by robert gates deputy director of the cia who said we are very concerned that the soviets continuing development efforts give them the potential for widespread abm deployments well in excess of the abm limits it is our job to prepare the national defense authorization that means determining sdi spending levels and helping shape strategic defense policies we also seem to be increasingly involved in shaping arms control policy if were going to do our job right we should get to the bottom of these findings as the wsj editorial says perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves if the house is going to make rational informed decisions about the unitedstates nuclear force and sdi and it is going to insist on involving itself in arms control policy then it has an equal responsibility to learn more about the air force inteiligence findings it is critical that we fully understand soviet strategic defense activities for that reason i have offered an amendment included in the chairmans en bloc amendment which will require the secretary of dod to provide a classified and unclassified report on soviet abm and abmrelated activities unfortunately the house did not have access to a full brief on this matter in time for this years authorization but with adoption of my amendment we will have this information to guide us next year i know that my colleagues share my desire to have a better understanding of soviet strategic defense actions intentions and capabilities and i urge their support for this amendment i include the following article from the wall street journal of february 25 1988 breakout our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought t conduct an onsite inspection we hear that air force intelligence has officially concluded the soviets have rolled production lines to break out of the abm treaty and deploy a nationwide antimissile system which possibly could be in place by next year that maj gen schuyler bissel head of air force intelligence briefed the cia on this conclusion late last week and that the finding is based on two new pieces of evidence first the soviets are internetting their earlywarning radars with interceptorguidance radars they have conducted handoff exercises in which the large phasedarray radars like the controversial one at krasnoyarsk pick up targets and alert the flat twin and pawn shop mobile radars that guide their sh04 and sii08 antimissile interceptors this is the key battle management function of an antimissile system second the soviets are mass producing the flat twin and pawn shop radars though the abm treaty limits them to two locations similarly they are mass producing the s1108 a relatively new supersonic missile that intercepts warheads within the atmosphere with 500 such missiles already produced and 3 000 ultimately projected the abm treaty limits each side to only 100 interceptors of all types and the soviets also have the si104 which intercepts above the atmosphere as well as other interceptors with both antiaircraft and antimissile capability while rich in detail our reports admittedly have not been from direct participants in these briefings we now find that the new york tribune the unification church paper in new york published substantially the same reports on monday quoting a senior military intelligence official an official conclusion that the soviets are breaking out of the abm treaty to be sure only would put an official stamp on what has been apparent all along the soviets have taken full advantage of treaty provisions allowing large radars at one abm site at missile test ranges and on the periphery of the nation to finish the job they simply ignored these restrictions to build at krasnoyarsk see map adapted from the pentagons soviet military power the administration has cited the krasnoyarsk radar as an outright violation and both houses of congress have voted their agreement the administration also has protested the deployment of flat twin and pawn shop radars at gomel beyond the sites permitted at the sary shagan and kamchatka test ranges in his compliance report to congress in december president reagan said the absence of soviet dismantlement of the krasnoyarsk radar the new violation in the deployment of the flat twin and pawn shop observed at gomel and the totality of soviet abmrelated activities in 1987 and previous years suggest that the ussr may be preparing an abm defense of its national territory these are the words of course of the same administration that currently has a new inf treaty before the senate and has just had its secretary of state in moscow pushing a new strategic arms treaty in time for the impending moscow summit a breakout finding would be of monumental importance to these enterprises on arms control in general the prospect of a soviet abm breakout raises once again the question of why we are negotiating new treaties with them when they are breaking the old ones on the proposed 50 reduction in offensive arms in particular the soviet abm technology is not star wars it is groundbased and many analysts think each interceptor carries a nuclear warhead so that highly accurate guidance is not needed but with our offensive weapons limited by treaty and with no defense of our own against a soviet first strike our deterrent could be significantly degraded even by this 1970s technology perhaps our reports or for that
