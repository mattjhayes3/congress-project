billion in 1997 256 billion in 2001 and 365 billion in 2004 in washington this is considered success obviously something stronger is needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the

will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second there are those groups who question the effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work

guard already is in the last notch even with a 4 percent increase over last years funding levels the fiscal year 1995 level will mean a 100 million cut in current services which will include separating 1 100 personnel and 1 000 reservists closing 14 search and rescue stations and ending the boat safety grant programone of the few government programs that actually works add to this equation the extra responsibilities so often heaped upon a willing but underfunded coast guard and you have a serious dilemma most recently the coast guard has been called to serve in an extra mission in the caribbean since january the coast guard has rescued 24 733 haitians who were part of the mass exodus unleashed earlier this year by the cornblued impact of the embargo and the everevolving back and forth refugee policies of the white house when fidel castro seized the opportunity to manufacture a refugee crisis of his own in nearby cuba the coast guard found themselves with 37 074 cubans to bring to safety at the height of this refugee crisis it was reported that every major cutter from the east coast had been committed to operations in the caribbean and some vessels had even been pulled from pacific northwest fisheries duties to fill in the gaps the cuban search and rescue mission alone occupied more than 3d coast guard cutters last year the incremental cost figure for haitian interdiction in the windward passage was 11 2 million this year although we have yet to receive a firm cost estimate for either the haiti or the cuba operation we can expect the costs to run much higher this week the coast guard picked up a new role port security for the united states occupation of haiti all of this paints a pretty clear picture of how the smallest of our armed forces has been repeatedly called upon to carry out extraordinary duties which are generally not anticipated in the authorizations and appropriations we pass here all indications are that this trend will continue but

unusual action during the campaign year to actually say what we were going to do after the election and sign a statement to that effect i am relatively new here i have had some surprises but the biggest surprise has been the reaction to the contract of the majority party and some of the members of the press one reaction is we cannot afford it or how are we going to pay for it as an outsider i find those questions incomprehensible how can we not afford to save money i think it is great if we can save money i think it is great if we can reduce the budget here what a strange attitude for the majority to display now i am beginning to understand what is meant by the inside the beltway mentality i come from the state of michigan which cut their budget by 1 8 billion a few yearsago the net result is a budget surplus this year the net result is that for the first time in 20 years the state of michigan has an unemployment level that is lower than the nation as a whole we can afford the

against congress borrowing money such an amendment he reasoned would defend the american people from the tyranny of government by keeping the federal government within its constitutional bounds if jefferson thought taxation without representation was bad he should see it with representation unfortunately mr jefferson never got his amendment and the government we have now is the culmination of his fears a bloated and ineffective mass that stretches itsconstitutional authority to the limit how bad is it this year with the introduction of his budget bill clinton claimed his administrations policies had solved the budget crisis his director of omb leon panetta stated that republicans would have killed to be able to offer this budget and we have been exposed to democrat after democrat crowing about the strength of the economy and their success at cutting the deficit what were they all cheering about according to clintons budget the deficit will fall to 175 billion next year then it will rise to 182 billion in 1997 256 billion in 2001 and 365 billion in 2004 in washington this is considered success obviously something stronger is needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the balanced budget amendment first they fear a balanced budget amendment will tie the hands of congress and force it to cut some programs in order to fund others in other words they fear that congress will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second there are those groups who question the effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work or not the answer is the balanced budget amendment will establish the framework under which congress will have to make its spending decisions congress will still have to make the spending decisions but it will be done without the openended funding option now available this is the third time in the last 4 years the house will vote on a balanced budget amendment four years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that congress didnt need the amendment to balance our budget we have the power right now they argued to deal with our deficit without amending the constitution the house defeated the amendment by seven votes since then the federal debt has grown by over 1 trillion two years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that the amendment would demean the constitution tie congress hands and hurt the economy the house defeated the amendment by nine votes since then the federal debt has grown by over 500 billion let us end this deficit madness let us

think it is fair to say that if the american people had any idea that candidate bill clinton was going to propose the largest tax increase in american history almost immediately after taking the oath of office he would not have been elected in november i doubt that those 43 percent of the voters who cast their ballots for bill clinton on election day were actually voting for an energy tax which will raise the price on everything from the gas pump to the grocery store i doubt that they were voting in favor of increased taxes on social se curity recipients i doubt that they were voting for middleclass tax increases particularly since candidate clinton was promising middleclass tax cuts and i doubt that they were voting to raise tax rates on small business owners and farmers by over a

that as an exception but we try and do away with that the second phase is that the more you fly an airplane the safer that airplane actually is because you are exercising it with the training cutback and the funding cutback that becomes deficit also so your pilots are not getting trained as much but the morale knowing that you do not have the up airplanes like a navy squadron on a carrier is likely to have 12 to 13 airplanes with f18s f14s a6s a7s but generally 10 to 12 airplanes if you have eight of those airplanes that are down because you cannot fix them the pilots will take the two

the presidents haiti policy is still producing all of the wrong results including a large and growing price tag although we have never had a formal response to our requests for cost estimates on the haiti operation this week we finally learned some revealing details from the news media we now know that it costs 15 300 a day to fuel the unitedstatess comfortthe hospital ship in kingston jamaica and the coast guard spends at least 120 000 a day to run that ship as a processing center we can add in 12 million paid to turks and caicos for use of a beach 1 5 million to rent a cruise ship we never used 63 000 a day to rent two other cruise ships and we still have not counted the costs of eight navy ships a dozen or so other coast guard cutters or the sanction enforcement teams in the dominican republic when we add it all up i suspect the price tag will seem staggering even to the big spenders in the clinton administration all this big money should be producing big results right wrong other than big misery to innocent haitian victims and united states businesses seeking to boost productivity in haiti our sanctions are having little impact on the targets of cedras and company in fact to the contrary the military junta in haiti is profiting from the embargo enriching itself through the sale of contraband often stolen from united states aid shipments aid workers are frustrated at every turn by the unintended consequences of the embargo particularly the rapid deterioration of infrastructure much needed food and medicine spoils on the docks for lack of machinery and trucks to move them we have seen the toll of such deterioration beforethe distended stomachs the reddish hair the sticklike limbsthese are the signs of malnutrition we now see in 2 out of 3

administration official with word getting out that the united states has upped its rate of positive asylum rulings from 5 percent to more than 30 percent of those applying it is no wonder haitians by the thousands are trying to make it to those processing ships this month the coast guard has intercepted more than 4 500 twice as many as we saw in may in the end if they cannot starve the haitians into democracy the president and his b team of foreign policy advisors seem committed to forcing a democracy at the barrel of a gun if the embargo should be declared a failure military intervention is

going to try to intervene militarily we and others have tried to provide the president with a better way out of this stalemate but all other views are being ignored and that is a tragedy for haitians

noncontroversial the same provision was signed into law as part of last years coast guardauthorization all that is changed is the page number it simply says when we give the coast guard extra missions beyond their normal functions we should provide the extra funding needed to carry those missions out certainly no department or agency can be immune from belttightening but the belt around the coast guard already is in the last notch even with a 4 percent increase over last years funding levels the fiscal year 1995 level will mean a 100 million cut in current services which will include separating 1 100 personnel and 1 000 reservists closing 14 search and rescue stations and ending the boat safety grant programone of the few government programs that actually works add to this equation the extra responsibilities so often heaped upon a willing but underfunded coast guard and you have a serious dilemma most recently the coast guard has been called to serve in an extra mission in the caribbean since january the coast guard has rescued 24 733 haitians who were part of the mass exodus unleashed earlier this year by the cornblued impact of the embargo and the everevolving back and forth refugee policies of the white house when fidel castro seized the opportunity to manufacture a refugee crisis of his own in nearby cuba the coast guard found themselves with 37 074 cubans to bring to safety at the height of this refugee crisis it was reported that every major cutter from the east coast had been committed to operations in the caribbean and some vessels had even been pulled from pacific northwest fisheries duties to fill in the gaps the cuban search and rescue mission alone occupied more than 3d coast guard cutters last year the incremental cost figure for haitian interdiction in the windward passage was 11 2 million this year although we have yet to receive a firm cost estimate for either the haiti or the cuba operation we can expect the costs to run much higher this week the coast guard picked up a new role port security for the united states occupation of haiti all of this paints a pretty clear picture of how the smallest of our armed forces has been repeatedly called upon to carry out extraordinary duties which are generally not anticipated in the authorizations and appropriations we pass here all indications are that this trend will continue but without more xealistic funding something will eventually have to give i dont believe that most americans are willing to give up on ongoing drug interdiction operations search and rescue operations fisheries law enforcement navigable waterway management or any of the other vital operations the coast guard performs while i know this amendment is not the solution to the coast guards budget shortfalls it is after all nonbinding and was largely ignored by the clinton administration in the past year but it is important because it puts members on record in support of a policy of providing adequate funding when we add to the list of missions perhaps next year we can work to go beyond such a policy statement and actually make it stick i urge members to once again support this amendment as a useful first step along this path but for now what better way to stand behind our heroic coast guard engaged in dangerous work in the nearby caribbean than to say we are going to provide the necessary resources for you to carry out these tough missions i would like to say at this time that i want to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from new jersey lmr hughes about the bipartisanship and leadership of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries i used to serve on that committee and i enjoyed that very much the difference between the partisanship or the lack of
