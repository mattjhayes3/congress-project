increasing procedural abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer amendments and resolutions waiving all the standing rules of the house however there are some other problems affecting the rules committee which have received far less attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call of emergency meetings will be restricted to real emergencies aside from its emergency designation there is nothing unusual about the provisions of this rule it waives points of order against the bill for lack of authorization and because there are legislative provisions in this appropriation bill it also waives points of order to protect an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania providing for a drugfree workplace this is a longer version of the walker amendment which is technically legislation on an appropriation bill there has been particular interest in a legislative paragraph in this bill which provides for a 4percent pay increase for all federal employees including members of congress that language is legislation on an appropriation bill but it is protected from a point of order by the provisions of this rule however there is nothing in this rule which restricts the

was joined in by my colleague the gentleman from california mr dornani and we discussed the policy of this government as exercised through its public health officials dealing with the aids epidemic among other things that were discussed in that special order yesterday was mention of a speech by dr david pence from a grand rapids address on november 4 1987 the time we were allotted yesterday expired before this address was completed and i think the comments of dr pence are important for the members of the house and for inserthat the american people have an opportunity of reading these comments of dr pence as well i would like at this time to conclude with the address that was left unread in my special order yesterday bear in mind that dr pence is a physician practicing medicine in the state of minnesota as i indicated to my colleagues yesterday this member from california as a senior member of the health and the environment subcommittee the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the health care bill that will be taken up by the house tomorrow at least that is the schedule we are scheduled to take the rule tomorrow and it has been on and off the agenda for better than a week now but we are scheduled to take up the rule tomorrow a modified closed rule that this member intends to contest on the grounds that there have been anywhere from 20 to 25 amendments that were not made in order by other members of the house both members of the committee and subcommitee on health and the environment as well as other members of the house and then i have been advised that we are scheduled to take up the aids bill itself on a date next week the precise date at this time is uncertain but we will begin the process tomorrow so i would like at this time to conclude with the address of dr pence so that my colleagues will have the benefit of his thinking the reason i have selected this address by dr pence is as i mentioned yesterday this member has studied a great deal on this issue in the last 3 years i have written some materials but this speech by dr pence i believe summarizes in a very succinct manner what we should be doing and are not doing today to control this epidemic in america the naive acceptance of the gay ideology by the medical profession and public health officials is probably best explained by a well meaning attempt not to discriminate most individuals who were not involved in the civil rights movement against racism tend to lump the traditional civil rights movement with the later feminist and gay liberation campaigns this hijacking of the freedom train by middle class careerists and sexual adolescents has virtually destroyed the real civil rights movement as karl marx said history the first time is tragedy the second time it is farce once again we have lost our historical memory of the real meaning and work of the early civil rights workers we have forgotten that the call of martin luther king was not for a world in which morality was separated from politicsquite the contrary he said i dream of a day when men will be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character the early civil rights movement did not try to build identity on skin color but affirmed the common humanity the common creator and the common citizenship of each of us the civil rights movement was built by black southern baptist ministers certainly today they must be shaking their wise old heads in heaven as they see in the words of kipling the truth theyve spoken twisted by the knaves to make a trap for fools it is certainly the hest kept secret in america that the great majority of black leaders consider homosexual rights to be not an extension of the civil rights movement but its betrayal we must be intellectually discerning enough to see the radical difference between the claims of the traditional civil rights movement and the gay lobby it is closer to the truth to understand the lobby as a middle class special interest group which has squandered the moral authority of the old civil rights movement and captured many of the government jobs in human rights agencies formerly held by racial minorities this same group is now quite successfully building up a multimillion dollar cottage industry under the banner of aids education the medical profession would never contemplate involving smokers or agents of the tobacco industry to lead an educational effort against lung cancer the fact that state after state has given public funds to men who not only engage in the behavior which spreads the disease but base their personal and social identities on this activity must cause any reasonable individual a considerable amount of reflective uneasiness the road to selma did not lead to

continuation of the different ones i have been speaking on concerning the japanese lobby today i have an interesting article as the members know for some time i have been reading from the book called the japanese conspiracy by marvin wolf which outlines the method that japan has used to target our indistries and of course there have been some questions as to whether mr wolf was accurate or whether he was not i was very happy when on sunday we found an article by a liberal columnist named richard reeves in the baltimore sun it was actually on august 9 he stated essentially what marvin wolf has claimed in his book the article is entitled the japan lobby and it explains how the japanese have cheated on their quotas with the british and how upset the british are with their behavior i will now read it it is datelined new york by richard reeves and it says you can buy a jeep with righthand drive at suzuki dealers in holland which seems strange because dutch cars have their steering wheels on the left the dutch drive the same way we do on the right side of the road he says it is the british who keep to the left and so need steering wheels on the right and in fact those dutch suzukis with englishlanguage dashboards and owners manuals are made and sold for the british market mr reeves points out the whole thing is a way one of many for japanese manufacturers to cheat on a court arrangement backed by the governments of great britain and japan this is how mr reeves says it works the japanese government and auto companies have agreed to restrict their exports to 11 percent of the british marketwhich is about 220 000 cars a year but when that quota has been met japanese ear dealers begin sending customers employees and relatives across the english channel to rotterdam to pick up the righthand drive cars there and bring them back to england as used cars such tricksand that is the word mr reeves usesaccording to auto experts in london actually give the japanese 16 percent or more of the british market it has got to stop said anthony beaumontdark a conservative member of parliament whose district happes to include a land rover factory of course land rover produces vehicles fourwheeled vehicles these people see rules the conservative member says as something to get around rather than something to abide by mr reeves continues to write saying things like that at least in the united states leaves one open to charges of japan bashing a civil disorder that some would equate with racism or antieemitism i would suspect though that mr beaumontdark might be just as upset if he thought the swedes or norwegians were the ones threatening the jobs of his constituents japan bashing in the united states mr reeves says and he says which he thinks isa healthy indication that americans can still read and write and count has created an equal and opposite counterforce a japan lobby that lobbysecond now only to the israel lobby which seems to have been an inspiration to the japanesewas built and is supported by the pennies of hundreds of thousands of americans working for japan inc from toyota dealers to lumberjacks cutting trees in oregon to make chopsticks in tokyo and i might just point out at this juncture in this article that we have created 106 000 more jobs in japan than they have in the united states and that is according to harpers index mr reeves says that if a congressman or columnist says that maybe we should take a look at whats happening and whether its good for all of us a reassuring face appears on television to say we dont understand free trade or something equally sacred it could be elliot richardsonelliot richardson according to business week is now chairman of the 25 million hitachi foundation which is the largest japanese foundation in the united states and hitachi is also setting up community action committees our information says mr reeves again says it could be elliot richardson or walter mondale or jim jones the former chairman of the house finance committeeall now working for or representing japanese or other foreign companies more than 100 former federal officeholders are among the hundreds and hundreds of americans now lobbying for foreign companies usually japanese the writer continues one of their great successes has been to help defeat legislation allowing the federal government to begin monitoring foreign investment in american propertiesa thing the japanese government does routinely we would not let it happen here because we said everybody would take their money and go home i think we should have given it a chance that number and others come from the research of pat choate a vice president of trw who is writing a book on foreign impact on the unitedstates economy and who also reports that 152 japanese companies and government agencies paid 100 million last year to 113 washington law firms and publicrelations agencies for lobbying in washington i placed that list in the congressional record on june 23 the japan lobby is in fact a growth industry according to mr reeves the association of foreign investors in america and that is the one represented by mr richardson and the association of foreign investors in real estate were both formed just this year reeves said that my own japanbashing credentials are i think in order even though i believe in free and fair trade its that i dont see japan practicing free trade or considering fairness at all i think in fact that japans willful selfinterested abuses of the spirit and letter of international trade agreements and systemsthe complaint of mr beanumontdark in englandcould destroy those systems if other major traders begin to play the game the japanese way continuing with mr reeves he said i said something like that to a japanese ambassador to a major industrial country a few weeks ago and he said in sadness not anger you have to understand that we cannot allow ourselves to be pushed too far on these matters and we cannot push our people too far because we are potentially a socially unstable country i say nonsense to that attitude because japan is a very strong aggressive country it is certainly the largest economic power in the world now mr reeves said what about us do you think america and americans can be pushed too far the japanese ambassador responded no you are flexible enough to take anything mr reeves concluded with his comment that the ambassador may have intended a compliment but that he mr reeves took it as a misjudgment that may cost both of us greatly the conclusion of this article is certainly most interesting to me i was surprised that a japanese ambassador would tell mr reeves thatyou have to understand that we cannot allow ourselves to be pushed too far on these matters and we cannot push our people too far because we are potentially a socially unstable country what does this mean to us does it call into question the reliability of their intentions as a friend it is a basic tenet of american life that we may argue with our friends over polltics and principle but you are still my friend we learn very early as youngsters the ground rules for friendship and not to step over a line because it would be an affront to a friend in fact anyone involved in politics has learned this lesson well and cherishes the individuality of our friends and our constituents this remark of the ambassadors is putting the burden of the relationship on the united states when he was asked do you think america and americans can be pushed too far he replied no you are flexible enough to take anything there is something that should be understood about the americans we are flexible but we will not take everything one of the outstanding features of being an american and living under this great constitution and prizing freedom the way we do is that americans have a sense of fair play i had a friend who succinctly expressed what fair play means to us she said americans are essentially free spirits because they prize freedom to protect it when youve cut their options they turn hostile the ambassador should know what we all understand we do not take everything off of everybody friendship is a twoway street when it becomes a real burden to us then difficulties begin i am including the article by mr reeves in the record tim japan louby by richard

delegates from seven states in attendance on that day robert morris a delegate from pennsylvania proposed that gen george washington be chosen president of the convention this was seconded by john

procedural abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer amendments and resolutions waiving all the standing rules of the house however there are some other problems affecting the rules committee which have received far less attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call of emergency meetings will be restricted to real emergencies aside from its emergency designation there is nothing unusual about the provisions of this rule it waives points of order against the bill for lack of authorization and because there are legislative provisions in this appropriation bill it also waives points of order to protect an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania providing for a drugfree workplace this is a longer version of the walker amendment which is technically legislation on an appropriation bill there has been particular interest in a legislative paragraph in this bill which provides for a 4percent pay increase for all federal employees including members of congress that language is legislation on an appropriation bill but it is protected from a point of order by the provisions of this rule however there is nothing in this rule which restricts the
