sure that these dollars are paid look this is a fundamental question should iran receive relief from the unitedstates sanctions before it pays the victims of terrorism the 43 billion that unitedstates courts say these victims are owed when we say terrorism what are we talking about we are talking about iranianbacked assassinations bombings and attacks across time zones from paris to jerusalem to new york to beirut to east africa to buenos aires i say not one cent these victims are united states citizens they are wives brothers and sisters children who hail from all across the nation and they were killed in hijackings and suicide attacks and bombings of buses and planes and buildings and embassies and shopping malls and pizza parlors in fact i met with one of those victims this morning and yesterday the widow of kenneth welch and his child they are here in washington today they have been waiting 30 years for the opportunity to see this issue addressed my friends by voting against this legislation you are saying that iran and the perpetrators of these atrocities deserve unitedstates sanctions relief before the victims deserve the courtordered compensation let me say it again by voting no you are putting the interests of irans terror machine before the american victims of that terror i say not 1 cent to those who say iran cant afford to pay these damages let me remind you of a few facts iran has a yearly gross domestic product in excess of 1 3 trillion and they just spent 21 billion on russian jets the facts show that iran has the money and will have much more if the sanctions are lifted money that our own administration freely admits will go to finance even more terror i sat yesterday with ken stethem the brother of robert stethem the united states navy diver who was executed on beirut flight 847 his brother ken himself a retired navy seal said to me yesterday if the president doesnt take this opportunity and congress doesnt take the opportunity to hold iran accountable for their terrorist acts now i have to ask them when will they thirty years for one family more than 15 for another when will they he is talking to us lets answer him lets today stand up for the standards of unitedstates navy petty officer robert stethem lets today vote as one house to say we will put robert stethem and the many victims of irans terrorism beforebeforethe criminals who

week ago yesterday the nation lost one of its most selfless and unique public servants with the passing of my predecessor former north carolina 10th district congressman cass ballenger up until 2005

protections where he authored groundbreaking legislation that improved workplace safety and created the opportunity for employers and regulators to be partners not adversaries in protecting the health and safety of workers as chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee on the international relations committee he took on the daunting and often thankless task of fighting to promote democracy and defend human rights in central and south american nations he did this not only for the sake of justice in those countries but also to protect the interests of the united states his personal commitment to serving his constituents is a legendary example that i strive every day to follow i was the beneficiary of his kind and gracious nature when i was elected to represent the 10th district in 2005 after his decision to retire from the house he personally provided me with guidance and assistance that immeasurably helped me as a new member of congress and ensured continuity of our quality constituent services for western north carolina in his personal and professional life cass placed others before himself he was a part of the greatest generation he fought in world war ii and returned home to go to college he started a family and joined his fathers business in box manufacturing he told his father that boxes were a thing of the past and the wave of the future was plastics it is

hilarious delivery he was one of the few people who could hold someone accountable in the most blistering way possible make you laugh and also help you out of a tight spot all in one conversation he

express our concerns with the inclusion of the cybersecurity act in the omnibus what was intended to be a cybersecurity bill to facilitate the sharing of information between the private sector and government was instead drafted in such a way that it has effectively become a surveillance bill and allows information shared by companies to be used by the government to prosecute unrelated crimes the bill intended to allow the private sector to share cyber threat indicators with government agencies however depending on the type of indicator it is highly likely that private information otherwise protected by the fourth amendment will also be disclosed to government surveillance agencies unfortunately as drafted the bill falls short of providing safeguards to protect americans private information in particular 1 this bill allows the use of shared information for more than just cybersecurity purposes it allows the government to investigate and prosecute specific threats to serious bodily injury or serious economic injury computer fraud and trade secrets violations among other criminal violations why this is of concern specific threats to serious bodily injury or economic harm are extremely broad categories of crimes so are identity theft computer fraud and trade secrets violations by allowing the use of this information for noncybersecurity purposes the bill encourages intelligence agencies to collect and retain as much information as they can for as long as possible in the unlikely event that one day it might be useful an alternative bill h r 1731 which received the largest house support prohibited these uses and limited the use of cyber indicators to only cyber security purposes for this reason 2 the bill fails to include an express prohibition on using this information for surveillance purposes why this is of concern express prohibition of surveillance is vital because past experience demonstrates that intelligence agencies will broadly interpret the included noncyber criminal allowances to perform surveillance for example few thought the national security agency nsa would interpret relevant to allow collection of every phone record in america surveillance is merely an investigation method so this bill contains no protections against the nsa or any other agency from conducting broad surveillance using this information in the name of stopping any enumerated offenses 3 the private sector and government are only required to remove personal information they know at the time of sharing to be included in the information they share with dhs why this is of concern the information sharing legislation that passed the house with the strongest support h r 1731 required both government and private sector to take reasonable efforts to scrub all personal information reasonably believed to be unrelated to a cybersecurity threat prior to sharing the information changing this to a knowing standard as the cybersecurity act does sets the bar too high developing automated systems to know that something is personal information is likely impossible as such the knowing standard encourages willful blindness why would the government or private sector expend time and effort to develop effective processes to determine when it knows something is personal information rather than just develop a cursory review process likely to permit the flow of private personal information furthermore by limiting scrubbing only to the time of sharing there is no requirement that the government remove personal information it later discovers finally the bill leaves details on how to develop privacy protection procedures around the collection storage and retention of shared information to dhs and also to the attorney general and director of national intelligence the ag and dni also determined these same standards for the bulkcollection of telephone metadata these standards allowed for the largest abuse of american privacy in recent history and necessitated congress passing the usa freedom act 4 no express limitations on what or how dhs can share information with the dod or nsa why this is of concern earlier this year congress passed major privacy reforms because past experience has shown that if the nsa acquires information they will use it in ways unintended by legislators every cybersecurity bill passed by the house this year has prohibited automatic information sharing and in some cases all sharing with the nsa without this prohibition designating dhs as the sole information sharing portal is essentially meaningless since dod and nsa automatically receive cyber threat indicators along with the rest of civilian agencies as this bill is drafted functionallythere is no difference between directly giving this information to dhs and directly giving it to the nsa there should be strong rules protecting personal information from being received processed and stored by intelligence agencies which this bill lacks sincerely"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "as an advocate for civil liberties and privacy rights i did not oppose the inclusion of his amendment here today on the floor and that was for good reason i believe

bipartisan fashion while normally i do support sunset provisions i think in this case submitting a sunset provision to this vital national security program would not be in our best interest i have

theme but this is sort of an auspicious day to actually do some of this as we are getting ready to do the omnibus the big budgetary bill what is so important here is i want everyone first to understand the 1 1plus trillion we are talking about is solely what we call the discretionary portion of the budget this is the portion of the budget we debate here we do amendments we work through and then in this particular case because of a series of blocks and frustrations and gameplaying that happened previously we get here to the end and we are trying to package it all together but it is not the majority it is not anywhere near close to the majority of our federal spending so take a look at this board and this is for 2015 so we are right now working on the budget for the 2016 appropriation cycle if you see the blue the blue is mandatory spending those are things like social security and medicare and medicaid and other parts of the welfare portion of our budget that are formuladriven that you hit a certain age you get a benefit you fall below a certain income you get a certain benefit it is about 69plus percent of our spending and this is for last year only 31 percent of the 2015 budget actually goes through this sort of normal appropriation process and that is really important to understand the scale of the spending and how little of it actually is debated because it is a formula it is also the portion of our spending that is exploding so we are going to walk through a couple of these boards today one of my goals is actually to also walk through and talk about what is actually happening in some of the mandatory spending and why for all of us we are going to have to have that very honest very difficult very math factbased conversation in my district the scottsdale phoenix area i am incredibly blessed i have an amazing constituency i have a wonderful area but we have done 100 of these budget townhalls over the last couple of years and i will get people who will come in and say but that number doesnt feel right i know it may not feel right previous politicians on both sides i think have underplayed what is happening in this country demographically and what it actually means to our commitment so if you are someone who really really really cares about keeping this country safe you need to be willing to start to understand what is happening in these numbers you need to understand the financial pressure that is going to be on your ability to finance the military if you care about health care you need to understand the financial pressure that is going to be coming to deal with those medical research education so lets first get our head around what is both happening and then we are going to actually walk through some demographic slides and the reason i want to do that is to understand this isnt the type of discussion where you can throw a switch and the solutions are simple the next slide this is actually sort of walking through the projections and understand these projections have actually changed a little bit but i didnt have a chance to finish all the calculations so this is functionally four budget cycles from now so it is the 2020 budget we are right now doing the 2016 budget at that point 76 percent of the spending is medicare medicaid social security interest on the debt veterans benefits and other transfer programs welfare programs 76 remember the budget cycle we just finished it was 69 in functionally 4 or 5 years it becomes 76 percent of all of our spending so if you care about the military if you care about healthcare research if you care about foreign aid if you care about any of those things it is shrinking rather dramatically as a percentage of our total spending yet you have got to understand from 2015 to that 2020 budget this government is going to go from i think it is a 3some trillion budget to a 4 1 trillion budget so in that few years we are going to actually increase by 1 trillion in spending and revenues and some of those revenues come from borrowing yet the ratio continues to explode because it is going into that mandatory spending this is demographics this is reality and unless you have a solution for baby boomers to stop like me turning gray we have to grow up and deal with it i find here in washington there is pathological avoidance of the reality that is upon us i am going to do this without knocking anything down and i believe these are already up on our web site the ability to sort of take a look and see where is the money actually going because i cant tell you how many times we would do those budget townhalls and someone would come in the door and say well david if you just did this if you would get rid of foreign aid that would take care of the problem then you go to this slide and try showing them that the tiny tiny tiny little sliver right there was foreign aid well david if you would just get rid of this well waste and fraud is huge the reality of it we know in medicare and medicaid and many of these things we have to come up with more dramatically efficient ways the use of technology we are going to start to talk about that at the end of this that there really are some solutions we need to be embracing but they are little slivers do you see the blue areas social security medicare medicaid welfare benefits interest on the debt as you saw today with the fed starting to raise interest rates we expect in just a few years interest to be bigger than the defense budget in about 7 years interest will be approaching 1 trillion a year understand this is the reality of the math this is no more happy talk that seems to go around in politics it is math this portion over here if you take out the defense departmentso if you look at defense and all this blue these here are all the agencies it is important to understand these numbers because i have been heartbroken at how often we do townhalls around our state and there is this misunderstanding of where the money is actually being appropriated so we are going to talk about a little bit of the demographics of what is going on but also how much trouble how much difficulty is social security in remember they used to say it is the third rail of politics you are not allowed to talk about it or tell the truth about it but we have a moral obligation to explain what is going on how about medicare how about some of these others so i wanted you to see this particular slide here and this just gives you a sense of also what is happening with us demographically i can remember many many years ago sitting in a statistics class over at arizona state universityi love that schooland this is i think in the early eighties and the professor is showing graphs saying you have got to understand in the 20152028 point you have all these baby boomers that move into retirement so i am sure the government i am sure washington d c will make sure they have these massive amounts of reserves set aside to provide benefits for our seniors well being one of those end of the baby boomer folks and now being here in washington realizing that money isnt there so when you look at this particular chartand the only reason it is partially hereyou see 2018 it is the next to the last bar and then all of a sudden the last bar do you see it is shooting up we have hit the time they have called the inflection point so in 22 months we hit the time that we have talked about for 30 years that the debt is going to start to explode in this country 2018 we are doing the 2016 budget right now we are already in the 2016 budget so 22 months from now the debt starts to explode so we are going to have a good year this year though because of some of the budget deal that was done about a month or so ago and some of the other lifting some of the spending caps of sequestration we are going to end up with a larger deficit this year so i guess the best number i have seen right now is 440 billion 450 billion this year but come 2018 a couple of years from now it starts to take off and it takes off for functionally the next 40 years this is the reality that is facing us so if you care about the military and education and all these other things understand what is about to happen here actually are some of the slides that start to become more difficult to talk about and i am actually sort of frustrated that we dont do more of this this particular chart hereand actually i think this one i may have taken from the wall street journal and for folks who are actually interested in these demographic facts and how they affect your country but also affect the world the wall street journal actually just recently finished a series i think they call 2050 and it actually has some of the best narratives best graphs best details i have ever seen in sort of walking through that this just isnt an american trend take a look at the numbers you see in china and other places around the world where the aging of the population compared to the benefits that have been promised compared to the number of workers and that imbalance and what that means to future economic growth for the world let alone just the united states but do you see this line where it starts to explode off the charts that is functionally enrollment in social security so when we were at 2008 we had about 41 million folks who were in social security today i believe now we have crossed 50 million so 20082015 this is the reality of how quickly that slope and it is the what it is the baby boomers remember we have about 76 million of our brothers and sisters who turn 65 in about an 18year period the first one the first baby boomer crossed that threshold i believe in late 2008 so we are in that demographic inflection you are going to start to see more and more of this reflected in our economic growth in the debt and the movement of your federal government resources into retirement programs for those who are over 65 whether it be medical whether it be indigent medical whether it be social security and others it is our commitment we have made these promises we have also made a promise that we need to find some way to pay for them and that is where this discussion hopefully is going to take us this slide is a bit more of a concern we are doing a project in our office right now we have a little a couple of folks set aside in our office called the idea shop and they try to do sort of detailed research outside the daytoday chaos that is being a member of congress it is really the bottom point here that i want to pop out at you and that is the number of our brothers and sisters the number of our fellow americans that are 5564 so they are heading towards retirement nineteen percent of them have no retirement savings at all so they are solely dependent on social security and the medical benefits that they will receive from medicare if we bounce up one 25 percent of those older than 45 have functionally no money set aside now i accept we have just come through a pretty rough economic cycle but the last couple of years it is getting better it is still not great but this is a point where we are starting to step up and understand we need a revolution in this countrys tax code we need a revolution in how we regulate in this country we all walk around with these supercomputers in our pocket information is ultimately the greatest regulator in a society and yet we still try and design these commandandcontrol functions of bureaucracies like it was the 1930s we are also going to do a little talking about embracing the new economy the hyperefficient economy that will hopefully maximize economic growth but everything whether it be from immigration to tax code to regulatory codes everything now the first words out of that politicians that policymakers that researchers and you as the constituents mouth needs to be how does this maximize economic growth for the country because i want to keep my commitment to the young and our commitments to seniors when you look at the numbers it does not happen unless we can get this economic expansion some economic growth really working so as we go through these slidesthe other thing is also for someone that is also really interested in these we try to put these up on our social media but these are some of the different projects we are working on now on this one this is just to sort of understand one more timeand i know i am repeating myself with the different slides but we did a budget deal about what 2 months ago social security disability was going broke social security disability in early mid2016 was functionally the trust fund for that was going to be gone so the solution that congress supportedi voted no but that is because we thought we had a more elegant solution functionally the political will was not there for the types of reforms we thought were appropriate they reached in and took 114 billion out of the big social security trust fund and moved it over here to the social security disability fund to shore it up okay that was their solution but there was almost no discussion around this body that it shortened the life of social security by about another year so when you take a lookthe reason we are showing these istake a look at this middle one if you were to exclude the interestnow understand the revenues for social security come from really two pots the taxes and then the money it has loaned to the government back to the general fund so the federal governmenti know it is just an accounting gimmick back and forth because we are paying ourselves interest but that is what we do we pay ourselves interest and that is considered one of the revenue sources for social security so if you were to take taxes and interest but if you were to look at that midline and say instead of the sort of bookkeeping entry we do back and forth no interest just the revenues from taxes on fica social security it went negative in 2010 so more money was going out to beneficiaries than what has been coming in in taxes but if you actually put both the interest and the tax stream it goes negative no longer in 2022 it goes negative now in 2021 so if i had a big marker i would walk over there and cross that out of course i would also knock over the board in doing it so functionally 5 years 60 months from now social security goes negative this is no longer that theoretical discussion we were having saying sometime off in the future sometime in 2027 sometime in 2040 it is 5 years it is less than one unitedstates senatorial term that social security goes negative how much discussion do you see in the political class in the researcher class the policy class and in our communities saying we need to deal with this today because every day we wait it becomes more difficult if we look at the history of the last couple of decades when those of us who care about this deeply have gotten behind microphones and started to point out the numbers we see the television ad the next campaign whether it be pushing paul ryan or a lookalike off of a cliff and saying that paul ryan wants to try to reform your entitlements becausethe fact of the matter is medicare is going bankrupt he wants to save the system but if we can scare you to death it becomes a great political issue i also believe the voters are way ahead of the political class in understanding we need to step up and do hard things to fix these i also want to make the argument that these are the biggest issues in front of us because if we dont do it then everything in the future is going to be how do we survive the promises we have made in our entitlements and it is coming fast remember social security goes negative in about 60 months that is how fast it is coming at us this was just to sort of reemphasize the factdo you see that little red area that is what we did in the budget deal a couple months ago we grabbed that 114 billion and pulled it out of social security because of that we shortened the life we tried to do this without knocking them over this was just another variation of the same set of numbers so now you know the reality we have some on medicare but when you start to see some of the charts we have charts that say that if there is not a substantial economic expansion medicare could be 7 years and the trust fund is substantially drained remember these are supposed to be freestanding trust funds the way the law works is you start to cut benefits we need to avoid these so how do you do it how do you avoid these the first argument i want to make is it is next year when we start to discuss tax reform a tax reform that maximizes economic growth maybe not the benefit for the group you belong to or the industry you are in but the tax reform that benefits the entire country to maximize economic growth i am also asking for a revolution in the way we look at the regulatory state there are a few people who have written about this there are a few people who have thought about this for a couple of years i sat on the science space and technology committee we would have debates back and forth with the epa on how did you get to this regulation how did you find this out they would say we are not going to give you our data sets it is proprietary we are just doing the command and control i learned there is this intense frustration there is this fight out there between i believe people who make money off the regulatory state and those who functionally pay for it which is all of us the fact of the matter is the crowdsourcing of information and data are we actually doing the most efficient methodology to have clean water and the most efficient technology to have clean air how about in my financial world i sit on the financial services committee this is going to get a little geeky but in 2008 the bonds that were backed by mortgages blew up all of a sudden we found out there were lots and lots and lots of mortgages and deeds of trust rolled into these bonds that stopped performing there were lots of debates and discussions of these were toxic loans they were alta that were put into these bonds whatever the reason how did we not know so we set up a financial system that bundled these mortgages into bonds are you telling me that from the regulatory state if we had designed an informationbased regulatory system where those of uswhen i was maricopa county treasurer and you were looking at buying debt to park the cash you had so you would get a rate of return for your taxpayers you would pick up the phone and call moodys or call s p or call the rating and say hey is this a safe bond is this a rated is it aaa or whatever it is you would get a phone call back they would say yes it is fine that was your due diligence how about a system that uses information so the information flows saying hey the bond you are looking at you now have 5 percent of the loans on it that arent making their payments hey do you realize this bond has an intense geographic concentration so if something happens in that geography you are going to have ever greater difficulties all of a sudden the regulators that are built into the system come in and bayonet the wounded after the war is lost sorry that was one of my fathers favorite sayings but the fact of the matter is the way we do much of our regulation is after the sins have happened instead of using information to avoid the mistake in the beginning so i am making the argument that that type of revolutionary thinking in the way we as a society regulate will maximize economic growth on immigration you need to change this immigration system when you realize that twothirds of the immigration population is familialand i know this sets peoples hair on fire but if you are going to take in 1 million 1 2 million legal immigrants into the country this year you do realize twothirds of that population functionally gets to come to the united states because of a family member where much of the rest of the world whether it be australia new zealand great britain canada have moved to a system that maximizes talent because they figured out they desperately need economic growth to keep their commitments but there is a fourth one that is almost never talked about and i can actually start to see here in congress and i see it in our state legislatures and that is actually the new economy i promise sometime when we get back in january we are going to do a presentation of how the new economy can both change how the government functions but also if we can get out of its way it provides opportunity for everyone and hopefully maybe some escape velocity economically so let me throw you first just a simple concept how many of you out there have ever ridden in a ride share or seen these things they call like zipcar where you hit the button on your phone and you are able to just use a car why doesnt government do that i think we saw some data that there are 176 000 cars that are either owned or leased by the federal government we found one small agency that had more vehicles than employees so if i came to you right now and said lets rethink this does this agency here belong owning their own little vehicle fleet and this agency that is right next door belong owning theirs why wouldnt you pool them together and create a simple app that does two things it says the cars belong to everyone in the agency you hit the button and say i need to use one today and tomorrow i dont need one and oh by the way the technology says that i am going to this community and it tells you who else from the bureaucracy is also going in the same direction it is already happening in the private sector now think of it even more expansive why is it just the federal government why wouldnt it be your state your local your tribal another example we are working on right now in arizona and we are actually working on with some of my state legislators is this concept for capital assets i live in maricopa county it is maybe the third or fourth most populous county in the country it is made up of 30some cities and tribal communities how many of those communities own the really expensive earthmovers how many of those earthmovers are used to their max every single day if they are not why isnt a simple app created to share so do this tribal community this city this county and this government each need to own their own why arent they put on sharing platforms the concept is real simple capital assets need to be maximized it is like the concept of a classroom at 3 45 when school is out does that classroom become the community college at 7 30 does it become the senior learning class it is a building we are paying to heat and cool it it is there we spent the capital money how do you maximize the utilization of capital assets this is happening in the private world much of this technology is coming out of silicon valley and other hubs of innovation in our country we need to open ourselves up in the government and say we need to be embracing this technology to move it to ourselves in the last half of this i see fights starting to break out on the new technology and how it changes how we work it changes our optionality we need to understand that technology is changing our society but if we can get out of the way it can actually really provide us some opportunities so there are crazy thoughts we are researching these lets say you are one of these drivers whether it be an uber platform or something else and there is this argument saying well you are being treated as a selfemployed 1099 or you are getting direct payments electronically or you are doing airbnb or these sorts of things how is that going to help you fund your social security maybe we need to rethink it maybe it really is time to have that honest conversation of should you be allowed to have that account that is truly yours and set up your technology that every time you have a client and you take them and deliver them to a location every time you have guests in your airbnb every time you provide a certain service you can use that technology so that a little bit of that money goes to your retirement account we have the technology it would be a very lowcost way to do it and we start to engage in the technology revolution that is happening around us to basically embrace it not be scared of it and at the same time use that technology to shore up what we have just talked about the devastating actuarial math we are running into i know there is a political battle coming in this because for some of my brothers and sisters on the other side it is very much how do i unionize that population how do i do this type of control how do i have this for many of those on the more free market side we are making the argument for individuals to be able to use technology and the new economy to pursue their optionality maximizing the value of their time they need to be allowed to do that we are americans being free is part of the basicit is supposed to be part of our dna at the same time use that same creativity that same optionality to not be afraid of it but to use that technology to actually grow the economy and embrace the empowerment of individuals to deal with the very problems we were showing on those

we keep diluting the value of our money it is worth nothing and if we keep diluting the value of the things that have made our society great the nucleus family if we keep doing that it becomes more washed out roughly 2 weeks ago the supreme courts 54 decision on obergefell v hodges demonstrated yet again the highest court in the land legislating from the bench the ruling was disappointing not only for the fact that the court had not four states to redefine marriage but even more so because it removes millions of american from the democratic process of choosing for themselves who and what defines marriage i personally and millionsyou brought up 51 millionhold a traditional view of marriage between one man and one woman and i am proud to say that i have been married to my wife carolyn for over 40 years god bless her because we know that is a tough job however the constitution grants people the voters the ability to decide whether or not to recognize samesex marriage chief justice roberts in his dissent made a valid point which i am sure is shared by many americans he said those who founded our country would not recognize the majoritys conception of the judicial role and then he continued they certainly would not have been satisfied by a system empowering judges to override policies judgments so long as they do so after a quiet extensive discussion with this type of legislation from the bench what is the point of the states rights i think that is what this gets down to because 30 states wanted to define and have the right according to the 10th amendment that it is a states rights issue if you live in that state and they decide what marriage is and you dont like it you have the freedom to move or challenge us through the state system i think it is a sad day in america when we have to as a country redefine who we are as a nation we have to redefine what marriage is an institution that has been around and ordained by god for over thousands of years 2 000years plus to come down to this point in our society we have got a book that we have lived by and i am going to hold this up for the viewers this is in total the declaration of independence and the constitution and you can see it is a very thin book it is not epic in volume but yet it is an epic in ideology of what a nation stands for a nation of laws we have the three branches of government i have been up here for 21 2 years and what i hear over and over again is we are in a constitutional crisis and being in congress for the last 21 2 years i see a lot of dysfunctionality and if we dont do our job you get other branches of government fulfilling that job and overstepping their boundaries i agree with justice antonin scalia when he stated in his dissent a system of government that makes the people subordinate to a committee of nonelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy wow those are powerful words a system of government that makes the people subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy we cannot allow our constitution to be eroded and i will continue to fight for the states rights and stop this continued federal power grab i look at justice roberts some of the dissension in his ruling and roberts forcibly criticized the majority sidestepping the democratic process and declaring that samesex couples have the right to marry when in his view such a right has no basis in the constitution the courts decision he complained orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human societies for millennia we are redefining that and then he goes on to the kalahari bushmen and to the han chinese the carthaginians and the aztecs just who roberts laments do we think we are the other three justices echoed roberts sentiment sometimes in even more strident terms justice scalia characterized the decision as a judicial putsch and suggested that before he signed on to an opinion like the majority i would hide my head in a bag this is from our supreme court justices i think it is a sad state of affairs that in the three branches of government that we are out of balance we as member of congress are the most powerful branch it is the way our founders set our country up it is the longest living democracy and constitutional free republic in the world the reason for that is the checks and balances i would like to say to you and to my colleagues that our three branches of government are seriously out of balance and at times during human history when the government oversteps its boundaries whether in total or in the different branches and they overstep the boundaries of the constitution it is not only our duty but it is our responsibility as americans and as the peoples house in the united states of congress to stand up and rein in government and hold those other branches accountable i look forward to working with my colleagues on the house floor to make sure

have said it is about free trade but it is a bit ironic for those who follow politics because on the one hand republicans were being told this will allow us to force the president to keep us apprised to give us notice of what is going on so that we can reign anything in that is not helpful to the country i didnt have that impression of the bill not when reading the tpa not going to the classified setting i mean i did that i read the tpp most of it having been a lawyer and a judge prosecutor done defense a chief justice i have litigated a lot of loopholes there are a lot of loopholes in that tpp there were loopholes in the tpa one of my democratic friends was telling me that he was being told that the whole reason the president came up here is that by passing this trade agreement it is going to allow the president to get his agenda done in the next 18 months without congress being able to stop him some of my democratic friends prefer that congress have more say than that and some were not happy with the proposal at all they also were smart enough to know there are a lot of american jobs that will be lost because of that bill i am not an isolationist i believe in free trade but i dont believe in free rein for a president i am afraid that is what it will do and that is why i had to vote no once again but it passed and now we will see if what some of my democratic friends were told is accurate in that the bill will allow the president to achieve his agenda without republicans being able to stop him it appears that way to me in reading the bills that he has got enough loopholes he can take advantage of plus even without loopholes there is a requirement of notification he was required to notify us before he released anybody from guantanamo he didnt do it he went ahead and released five of the worst murderers in return for a guy who is we are told about to be charged with desertion the president doesnt seem to be bogged down by having to follow the law but i am impressed with my friends who thinkbut yesif we pass one more law that makes him give us notice after 61 2 years of his not keeping us apprised as the law requires this time we think he really really will i am impressed with that kind of optimism even though the old expression here in washington is no matter how cynical you get it is never enough to catch up sometimes i think there is merit to that in any event there is an issue even far more important than trade that is about to hit this country it could create a constitutional crisis of proportions that some of the justices on the supreme court cant imagine i blew up the law this is the law it is not an ethical requirement i mean having been a prosecutor a defenseheck i was even courtappointed to appeal a capital murder conviction i dont know how many here on the floor have appealed a capital murder conviction i begged the judge not to appoint me but he did anyway and when i got into the thousands of pages of records i found out he had not gotten a fair trial i fought for him in the highest court in texas and got the death penalty reversed some clients felt like i was a pretty good lawyer i was told before i went on the bench that i got the only jury verdict against what was then the largest oil company in the world i dont know if it was or is that is what i was told i know something about practicing law and i know something about being a judge i know that with any case in which the public would suspect that i could not be impartial i would have to recuse myself sometimes judges will just recuse themselves so they dont have to make a tough calli never did thatbut there are times when you have such a strong opinion about a matter that you have no business sitting on that case now ethical requirements would insist that a judge conduct his performance as a judge in such a way that it comports with the requirements of the canons of ethics however this isnt an ethical violation that would get you a letter from some bar president or from somebody saying we think you violated the canons of ethics this isnt it this is united states law this is the law of the land this is part a part b goes into some different possibilities when a judge might have to recuse him or herself but it is volume 28 of the united states code section 455 and section a doesnt have any subparts to it like b does b is like i say other examples where the judge might have to recuse himself but a is unequivocal any justice judge or magistrate judge of the united states shall that is a shall disqualify himself generic male or female in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned this is not some model code of ethics this is the united states law no one in the country including on the united states supreme court is supposed to be above the law as we have talked about we have two justices who have performed samesex marriages in fact the article by greg richter may 18 of 2015 is quoting from maureen dowd in her article in which maureen dowd writes regarding justice ginsburg with a sly look and special emphasis on the word constitution justice ginsburg said that she was pronouncing the two men married by the powers vested in her by the constitution of the united states now there is no question that justice ginsburg is biased prejudiced she has her own opinion about this matter she has had her opinion about this that was clear in the first samesex marriage she performed for her not to disqualify herself is a violation of the law of the united states yet we are told that justice ginsburg is not going to recuse herself that she wants to be part of a majority opinion what happens when someone who is disqualified for sitting on a case sits on a case anyway in order to use her partial biased position to bring about a majority opinion it would certainly seem that that would be an illegal act not criminalthis isnt criminal lawbut it is an illegal act for someone to violate this law then of course we also had justice kagan as mentioned in the fall of last year in september of last year in the hill when peter sullivan reported supreme court justice elena kagan officiated a samesex wedding on sunday a court spokeswoman told the associated press the ceremony in maryland for a former law clerk is the first samesex wedding that kagan has performed justice ruth bader ginsburg and retired justice sandra day oconnor have performed samesex weddings in the past gay marriage the article reads has been a divisive topic at the supreme court as it has been elsewhere in the country the article reads the court could decide as early as this month whether to take up the issue again in the coming session this time to consider a more sweeping ruling declaring a right to samesex marriage across the country ginsburg said last week that unless an appeals court allows a gay marriage ban to stand there is no need for us to rush on a supreme court ruling but they took the case up and now we are told they are going to rule by june 30 of this month clearly justice kagan is disqualified she has had a profound opinion it reads in which the impartiality might reasonably be questioned there are different standards of evidence in the law some states use different burdens of proof you can have more likely than not if it is a group like on a jury one more than half if there is a preponderance of the evidence that it is more likely than not then you find that way probable cause is an issue that has an evidentiary requirement it has got to be probably something is likely or has occurred a preponderance of the evidence i mentioned that beyond a reasonable doubt is what most criminal courts have before you can find someone guilty evidence must be beyond a reasonable doubt there are some courts that use a standard called clear and convincing evidence this united states law doesnt use any of those standards it is a very weak threshold before a judge or a justice must disqualify himself he must disqualify himself i hated the fact that justice scalia some years back had to disqualify himself but he had already had an opinion expressed about i believe it was the pledge of allegiance he could not be sure that it wouldnt end up as a 44 decision which meant the ninth circuit decision would stand which struck down under god in the pledge as i recall but he disqualified himself justice scalia followed 28 usc he disqualified himself because his judgmenthis impartialitymight reasonably be questioned it appeared that he was partial that he had an opinion in the case so he disqualified himself that is acting in accordance with the law i keep coming back to this it is a matter of a constitutional crisis when the highest court in the land not merely strikes down and says that their opinion is more important than moses depicted up there in the center point of this room more important than moses depicted in the marble wall over the supreme court holding the ten commandments the supreme court says theirs is more important than the opinions established and stated by jesus christ when he saidand he was quoting mosesthat a man shall leave his mother and father a woman leave her home and the two will come together and be one flesh and what god has joined together let no man put asunder that is the law of god according to moses it is the law of god according to jesus it is tough enough if you have a united states supreme court which back in the 1890s said this is clearly a christian nation despite what any opinions may be the evidence established this country was established as a christian nation the great thing is that if a nation is established on judeochristian beliefs it allows anybody to live here and to function here and to do so without impediment to ones beliefs because one can be an atheist an agnostic a buddhist a muslim you can be any of those things as long as you are not trying to take over the country like some would like to do but otherwise by basing a country on judeochristian beliefs we have provided more freedom for individuals than any nation in the history of the world and yet we may have an ultimate crisis here when a court says our opinion is more important than god if there is one more important than moses more important than jesus our opinion is not only more important than those people but it is the law of the land and it is so important that our opinion count that we are going to violate the law ourselves in order to force our opinionclearly what it isour opinion on the united states of america i dont want anybody to be prejudiced against anybody else i was sick to my stomach this morning hearing about the shooting in charleston south carolina this evil perpetrator killed my brothers and sisters we are brothers and sisters in christ skin color does not matter one bit he killed my brothers and sisters i hope america joins me in mourning i know the people on both sides of this aisle do at our prayer breakfast this morning we prayed and will continue to pray for the families of those who were lost those christians we as christians believe as jesus told the thief beside him this day you will be in paradise with me we believe they are better off than any of us here in the united states or on earth because of their beliefs we believe they are in paradise with jesus himself with the lord but it is the terrible wake they leave behind that is so tragic state senator from all accounts a good man not only a christian brother but a really good man pastor three men six women so our hearts go out to them we dont want anybody to be prejudiced against anybody but when it comes to the founding block the foundation of any solid society it doesnt matter what relationships exist it doesnt matter who loves or is friends with whom as a christian i think i can love most everybody there are a few it is kind of tough but most everybody i have got some democrats over here i love them they are just wonderful people they are wrong on issues but i love them they are great folks there is no animus but when it comes to the foundation of this nation the home a mother and a father regardless of what other relationships may exist between siblings between anybody else what matters is you dont destroy the central building block i was intrigued when the iowa supreme court back in 2009 didnt use these words but basically said there is no evidence in nature to indicate a preference of a marriage being between a man and a woman it was clear the people of iowa spokei love those folks they were awesome they came out and for the first time since the upordown retention vote started i understand in 1960 or 1962 or so they threw out the judges that were up for reelection because the vast majority in iowa knew that is ridiculous nature makes very clear that you start a family whether you keep both a mother and father things happen there are so many of our greatest americans have arisen from orphanages or from singleparent homes but still it doesnt get away from the optimum being nature says you are best off if you have a mother and father they can produce children yes you can adopt children sure but that is where nature comes in and says yeah but the optimum is a mother and a father in a home i know there are some who are involved in samesex marriage they are not able to love as i do they hate anybody that disagrees with them there are some that can love me though we disagree i hope that the continued hatred that has been growing among some in the samesex community can be tamped down but this is an issue that is foundational to any society that is going to maintain strength going to maintain viability for a long time into the future rather than show we just crossed another milestone on our way to the dustbin of history this is something that is important to our society to our foundation lets love everybody lets use law enforcement to stop those like the evil perpetrator in charleston like the leftwinger i think it was in north carolina that killed the muslims there is no call for that the man needs to go to prison in texas we would say it is a multiple murder i would say you need to get the death penalty for killing more than one muslim there is no place for that but again when it comes to the optimum home a loving mother and father can procreate adopt but regardless of who agrees or disagrees this is going to be a civilization changer and it is not going to be for the better we are going to continue our divisiveness and destructiveness when the highest court in the land has justices that say my opinion is so much more important than the bible moses jesus my opinion is so much more valuable that i am going to violate the law i am going to break the law so i can sit on this opinion so the country can have my forced opinion on it i know there are christian leaders some are ready to capitulate but there are some that wont but we are now to the point steve king and i and some others addressed back when the hate crime bill was being discussed that we are going to lead to the point where you ultimately persecute eventually prosecute people because of their beliefs about sexuality people then were wrong because they couldnt see the future but this is where we have come now if you hold the same beliefs that david axelrod says the president didnt but he said it in order to get elected that a marriage is a man and a woman you hold that belief that most americans have held and still hold that the founders all held regardless of their sexuality they believed a family marriage at least was a man and a woman that that was foundational so i am not sure what is going to happen in this country i dont have that kind of crystal ball but i know if we have two or three justices who are clearly disqualified who have clearly indicatednot only raised questions as to whether they could be reasonably questioned as to their impartiality they made clear they are very very partial i dont know what happens but it isnt going to be good at all justice sotomayor has made statements that indicate she has an opinion before this case was decided so i hope scholars will look carefully at this and they will understand if supreme court justices violate the law in order to change the law dramatically as they want to do is that a valid law i dont believe it is if they break the law in order to make the law it is a void law they need to recuse themselves and let an impartial group on the court make the decision it should be left to the states anyway it is probably sufficient grounds for impeachment for a supreme court justice to violate the law so that they can force their will upon the american people to push through their legislative agenda even though they are not legislators probably impeachment would be in order if they break the law in order to change dramatically the law they shouldnt be on the supreme court it is my hope and prayer they will do the legal thing recuse themselves before the court makes its final decision with regard to marriage if they dont they will go down in legitimate american history books as being exceedingly destructive and history will note that they violated the law in order to change the law so that it would be the way they wanted not with a constitutional amendment not through a legislative process not by a constitutional convention that article v provides for they just had the feeling that they wanted to tinker with over 200 years of law and foundational societal structure and force america to abide by their legislative agenda again i just cant get over that if they dont disqualify themselves they will violate the law to try to change the law with the agenda they have made clear that they have so i hope americans will join me in not only hoping but praying that their hearts will be touched that they will decide not to act illegally that they will be moved toward acting lawfully disqualify themselves and let us get a proper opinion from the supreme court i yield back the balance of my time"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "we are here today discussing how to meet the countrys important infrastructure needs and i think what my amendment does is offer a vision for a different approach in the future i think it is an approach that is more accountable to taxpayers and i think it rests on governments closer to the people making more of our transportation decisions i dont think anyone is going to sit here and claim that the transit and highway system as it is done up here in washington is being done well it is chronically underfunded we are using all kinds of budget gimmicks in this bill we are doing the strategic petroleum reserve again to quote unquote pay for this somehow you are taking oil at 50 a barrel and you are projecting it to be sold for 85 a barrel so we know we have been through this a lot here i think part of the problem is if you look at our infrastructure needs most of them are intrastate not necessarily interstate and while the interstate system is very important and it needs to be maintained expanded where appropriate most of the needs that we have in a state like florida can be done at the county level or at the state level i would note that since we have had the highway trust fund since 1956 florida has paid a lot in taxes and we received about 88 cents on the dollar back so i am trying to figure out why we would want to perpetuate a system that is not fiscally sustainable and that puts more power in washington think about it most of your needs are done countywide citywide and statewide and yet people in a state like florida will pay their gas taxes that will be shipped up to washington people will fight over it politicians lobbyists and interest groups and then the money that comes back is 88 cents on the dollar i would like to send the gas tax to washington that is going to fund the actual interstate system but then leave a portion of the gas tax for state legislatures to spend or for people in local governments to spend i think you would be able to do it cheaper i think it would be more accountable to the taxpayers and i think it would be better for motorists and people who are using our transportation system so all this does it is not binding i wish we could have done something binding but there are different budget rules what it does is lay out a vision that we can do this in a way that rests on decisions being

polis in opposition dear colleague we are writing to express our concerns with the inclusion of the cybersecurity act in the omnibus what was intended to be a cybersecurity bill to facilitate the sharing of information between the private sector and government was instead drafted in such a way that it has effectively become a surveillance bill and allows information shared by companies to be used by the government to prosecute unrelated crimes the bill intended to allow the private sector to share cyber threat indicators with government agencies however depending on the type of indicator it is highly likely that private information otherwise protected by the fourth amendment will also be disclosed to government surveillance agencies unfortunately as drafted the bill falls short of providing safeguards to protect americans private information in particular 1 this bill allows the use of shared information for more than just cybersecurity purposes it allows the government to investigate and prosecute specific threats to serious bodily injury or serious economic injury computer fraud and trade secrets violations among other criminal violations why this is of concern specific threats to serious bodily injury or economic harm are extremely broad categories of crimes so are identity theft computer fraud and trade secrets violations by allowing the use of this information for noncybersecurity purposes the bill encourages intelligence agencies to collect and retain as much information as they can for as long as possible in the unlikely event that one day it might be useful an alternative bill h r 1731 which received the largest house support prohibited these uses and limited the use of cyber indicators to only cyber security purposes for this reason 2 the bill fails to include an express prohibition on using this information for surveillance purposes why this is of concern express prohibition of surveillance is vital because past experience demonstrates that intelligence agencies will broadly interpret the included noncyber criminal allowances to perform surveillance for example few thought the national security agency nsa would interpret relevant to allow collection of every phone record in america surveillance is merely an investigation method so this bill contains no protections against the nsa or any other agency from conducting broad surveillance using this information in the name of stopping any enumerated offenses 3 the private sector and government are only required to remove personal information they know at the time of sharing to be included in the information they share with dhs why this is of concern the information sharing legislation that passed the house with the strongest support h r 1731 required both government and private sector to take reasonable efforts to scrub all personal information reasonably believed to be unrelated to a cybersecurity threat prior to sharing the information changing this to a knowing standard as the cybersecurity act does sets the bar too high developing automated systems to know that something is personal information is likely impossible as such the knowing standard encourages willful blindness why would the government or private sector expend time and effort to develop effective processes to determine when it knows something is personal information rather than just develop a cursory review process likely to permit the flow of private personal information furthermore by limiting scrubbing only to the time of sharing there is no requirement that the government remove personal information it later discovers finally the bill leaves details on how to develop privacy protection procedures around the collection storage and retention of shared information to dhs and also to the attorney general and director of national intelligence the ag and dni also determined these same standards for the bulkcollection of telephone metadata these standards allowed for the largest abuse of american privacy in recent history and necessitated congress passing the usa freedom act 4 no express limitations on what or how dhs can share information with the dod or nsa why this is of concern earlier this year congress passed major privacy reforms because past experience has shown that if the nsa acquires information they will use it in ways unintended by legislators every cybersecurity bill passed by the house this year has prohibited automatic information sharing and in some cases all sharing with the nsa without this prohibition designating dhs as the sole information sharing portal is essentially meaningless since dod and nsa automatically receive cyber threat indicators along with the rest of civilian agencies as this bill is drafted functionallythere is no difference between directly giving this information to dhs and directly giving it to the nsa there should be strong rules protecting personal information from being received processed and stored by intelligence agencies which this bill lacks sincerely"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as an advocate for civil liberties and privacy rights i did not oppose the inclusion of his

little worn it is because it is a shall we say the continuation of a theme but this is sort of an auspicious day to actually do some of this as we are getting ready to do the omnibus the big budgetary bill what is so important here is i want everyone first to understand the 1 1plus trillion we are talking about is solely what we call the discretionary portion of the budget this is the portion of the budget we debate here we do amendments we work through and then in this particular case because of a series of blocks and frustrations and gameplaying that happened previously we get here to the end and we are trying to package it all together but it is not the majority it is not anywhere near close to the majority of our federal spending so take a look at this board and this is for 2015 so we are right now working on the budget for the 2016 appropriation cycle if you see the blue the blue is mandatory spending those are things like social security and medicare and medicaid and other parts of the welfare portion of our budget that are formuladriven that you hit a certain age you get a benefit you fall below a certain income you get a certain benefit it is about 69plus percent of our spending and this is for last year only 31 percent of the 2015 budget actually goes through this sort of normal appropriation process and that is really important to understand the scale of the spending and how little of it actually is debated because it is a formula it is also the portion of our spending that is exploding so we are going to walk through a couple of these boards today one of my goals is actually to also walk through and talk about what is actually happening in some of the mandatory spending and why for all of us we are going to have to have that very honest very difficult very math factbased conversation in my district the scottsdale phoenix area i am incredibly blessed i have an amazing constituency i have a wonderful area but we have done 100 of these budget townhalls over the last couple of years and i will get people who will come in and say but that number doesnt feel right i know it may not feel right previous politicians on both sides i think have underplayed what is happening in this country demographically and what it actually means to our commitment so if you are someone who really really really cares about keeping this country safe you need to be willing to start to understand what is happening in these numbers you need to understand the financial pressure that is going to be on your ability to finance the military if you care about health care you need to understand the financial pressure that is going to be coming to deal with those medical research education so lets first get our head around what is both happening and then we are going to actually walk through some demographic slides and the reason i want to do that is to understand this isnt the type of discussion where you can throw a switch and the solutions are simple the next slide this is actually sort of walking through the projections and understand these projections have actually changed a little bit but i didnt have a chance to finish all the calculations so this is functionally four budget cycles from now so it is the 2020 budget we are right now doing the 2016 budget at that point 76 percent of the spending is medicare medicaid social security interest on the debt veterans benefits and other transfer programs welfare programs 76 remember the budget cycle we just finished it was 69 in functionally 4 or 5 years it becomes 76 percent of all of our spending so if you care about the military if you care about healthcare research if you care about foreign aid if you care about any of those things it is shrinking rather dramatically as a percentage of our total spending yet you have got to understand from 2015 to that 2020 budget this government is going to go from i think it is a 3some trillion budget to a 4 1 trillion budget so in that few years we are going to actually increase by 1 trillion in spending and revenues and some of those revenues come from borrowing yet the ratio continues to explode because it is going into that mandatory spending this is demographics this is reality and unless you have a solution for baby boomers to stop like me turning gray we have to grow up and deal with it i find here in washington there is pathological avoidance of the reality that is upon us i am going to do this without knocking anything down and i believe these are already up on our web site the ability to sort of take a look and see where is the money actually going because i cant tell you how many times we would do those budget townhalls and someone would come in the door and say well david if you just did this if you would get rid of foreign aid that would take care of the problem then you go to this slide and try showing them that the tiny tiny tiny little sliver right there was foreign aid well david if you would just get rid of this well waste and fraud is huge the reality of it we know in medicare and medicaid and many of these things we have to come up with more dramatically efficient ways the use of technology we are going to start to talk about that at the end of this that there really are some solutions we need to be embracing but they are little slivers do you see the blue areas social security medicare medicaid welfare benefits interest on the debt as you saw today with the fed starting to raise interest rates we expect in just a few years interest to be bigger than the defense budget in about 7 years interest will be approaching 1 trillion a year understand this is the reality of the math this is no more happy talk that seems to go around in politics it is math this portion over here if you take out the defense departmentso if you look at defense and all this blue these here are all the agencies it is important to understand these numbers because i have been heartbroken at how often we do townhalls around our state and there is this misunderstanding of where the money is actually being appropriated so we are going to talk about a little bit of the demographics of what is going on but also how much trouble how much difficulty is social security in remember they used to say it is the third rail of politics you are not allowed to talk about it or tell the truth about it but we have a moral obligation to explain what is going on how about medicare how about some of these others so i wanted you to see this particular slide here and this just gives you a sense of also what is happening with us demographically i can remember many many years ago sitting in a statistics class over at arizona state universityi love that schooland this is i think in the early eighties and the professor is showing graphs saying you have got to understand in the 20152028 point you have all these baby boomers that move into retirement so i am sure the government i am sure washington d c will make sure they have these massive amounts of reserves set aside to provide benefits for our seniors well being one of those end of the baby boomer folks and now being here in washington realizing that money isnt there so when you look at this particular chartand the only reason it is partially hereyou see 2018 it is the next to the last bar and then all of a sudden the last bar do you see it is shooting up we have hit the time they have called the inflection point so in 22 months we hit the time that we have talked about for 30 years that the debt is going to start to explode in this country 2018 we are doing the 2016 budget right now we are already in the 2016 budget so 22 months from now the debt starts to explode so we are going to have a good year this year though because of some of the budget deal that was done about a month or so ago and some of the other lifting some of the spending caps of sequestration we are going to end up with a larger deficit this year so i guess the best number i have seen right now is 440 billion 450 billion this year but come 2018 a couple of years from now it starts to take off and it takes off for functionally the next 40 years this is the reality that is facing us so if you care about the military and education and all these other things understand what is about to happen here actually are some of the slides that start to become more difficult to talk about and i am actually sort of frustrated that we dont do more of this this particular chart hereand actually i think this one i may have taken from the wall street journal and for folks who are actually interested in these demographic facts and how they affect your country but also affect the world the wall street journal actually just recently finished a series i think they call 2050 and it actually has some of the best narratives best graphs best details i have ever seen in sort of walking through that this just isnt an american trend take a look at the numbers you see in china and other places around the world where the aging of the population compared to the benefits that have been promised compared to the number of workers and that imbalance and what that means to future economic growth for the world let alone just the united states but do you see this line where it starts to explode off the charts that is functionally enrollment in social security so when we were at 2008 we had about 41 million folks who were in social security today i believe now we have crossed 50 million so 20082015 this is the reality of how quickly that slope and it is the what it is the baby boomers remember we have about 76 million of our brothers and sisters who turn 65 in about an 18year period the first one the first baby boomer crossed that threshold i believe in late 2008 so we are in that demographic inflection you are going to start to see more and more of this reflected in our economic growth in the debt and the movement of your federal government resources into retirement programs for those who are over 65 whether it be medical whether it be indigent medical whether it be social security and others it is our commitment we have made these promises we have also made a promise that we need to find some way to pay for them and that is where this discussion hopefully is going to take us this slide is a bit more of a concern we are doing a project in our office right now we have a little a couple of folks set aside in our office called the idea shop and they try to do sort of detailed research outside the daytoday chaos that is being a member of congress it is really the bottom point here that i want to pop out at you and that is the number of our brothers and sisters the number of our fellow americans that are 5564 so they are heading towards retirement nineteen percent of them have no retirement savings at all so they are solely dependent on social security and the medical benefits that they will receive from medicare if we bounce up one 25 percent of those older than 45 have functionally no money set aside now i accept we have just come through a pretty rough economic cycle but the last couple of years it is getting better it is still not great but this is a point where we are starting to step up and understand we need a revolution in this countrys tax code we need a revolution in how we regulate in this country we all walk around with these supercomputers in our pocket information is ultimately the greatest regulator in a society and yet we still try and design these commandandcontrol functions of bureaucracies like it was the 1930s we are also going to do a little talking about embracing the new economy the hyperefficient economy that will hopefully maximize economic growth but everything whether it be from immigration to tax code to regulatory codes everything now the first words out of that politicians that policymakers that researchers and you as the constituents mouth needs to be how does this maximize economic growth for the country because i want to keep my commitment to the young and our commitments to seniors when you look at the numbers it does not happen unless we can get this economic expansion some economic growth really working so as we go through these slidesthe other thing is also for someone that is also really interested in these we try to put these up on our social media but these are some of the different projects we are working on now on this one this is just to sort of understand one more timeand i know i am repeating myself with the different slides but we did a budget deal about what 2 months ago social security disability was going broke social security disability in early mid2016 was functionally the trust fund for that was going to be gone so the solution that congress supportedi voted no but that is because we thought we had a more elegant solution functionally the political will was not there for the types of reforms we thought were appropriate they reached in and took 114 billion out of the big social security trust fund and moved it over here to the social security disability fund to shore it up okay that was their solution but there was almost no discussion around this body that it shortened the life of social security by about another year so when you take a lookthe reason we are showing these istake a look at this middle one if you were to exclude the interestnow understand the revenues for social security come from really two pots the taxes and then the money it has loaned to the government back to the general fund so the federal governmenti know it is just an accounting gimmick back and forth because we are paying ourselves interest but that is what we do we pay ourselves interest and that is considered one of the revenue sources for social security so if you were to take taxes and interest but if you were to look at that midline and say instead of the sort of bookkeeping entry we do back and forth no interest just the revenues from taxes on fica social security it went negative in 2010 so more money was going out to beneficiaries than what has been coming in in taxes but if you actually put both the interest and the tax stream it goes negative no longer in 2022 it goes negative now in 2021 so if i had a big marker i would walk over there and cross that out of course i would also knock over the board in doing it so functionally 5 years 60 months from now social security goes negative this is no longer that theoretical discussion we were having saying sometime off in the future sometime in 2027 sometime in 2040 it is 5 years it is less than one unitedstates senatorial term that social security goes negative how much discussion do you see in the political class in the researcher class the policy class and in our communities saying we need to deal with this today because every day we wait it becomes more difficult if we look at the history of the last couple of decades when those of us who care about this deeply have gotten behind microphones and started to point out the numbers we see the television ad the next campaign whether it be pushing paul ryan or a lookalike off of a cliff and saying that paul ryan wants to try to reform your entitlements becausethe fact of the matter is medicare is going bankrupt he wants to save the system but if we can scare you to death it becomes a great political issue i also believe the voters are way ahead of the political class in understanding we need to step up and do hard things to fix these i also want to make the argument that these are the biggest issues in front of us because if we dont do it then everything in the future is going to be how do we survive the promises we have made in our entitlements and it is coming fast remember social security goes negative in about 60 months that is how fast it is coming at us this was just to sort of reemphasize the factdo you see that little red area that is what we did in the budget deal a couple months ago we grabbed that 114 billion and pulled it out of social security because of that we shortened the life we tried to do this without knocking them over this was just another variation of the same set of numbers so now you know the reality we have some on medicare but when you start to see some of the charts we have charts that say that if there is not a substantial economic expansion medicare could be 7 years and the trust fund is substantially drained remember these are supposed to be freestanding trust funds the way the law works is you start to cut benefits we need to avoid these so how do you do it how do you avoid these the first argument i want to make is it is next year when we start to discuss tax reform a tax reform that maximizes economic growth maybe not the benefit for the group you belong to or the industry you are in but the tax reform that benefits the entire country to maximize economic growth i am also asking for a revolution in the way we look at the regulatory state there are a few people who have written about this there are a few people who have thought about this for a couple of years i sat on the science space and technology committee we would have debates back and forth with the epa on how did you get to this regulation how did you find this out they would say we are not going to give you our data sets it is proprietary we are just doing the command and control i learned there is this intense frustration there is this fight out there between i believe people who make money off the regulatory state and those who functionally pay for it which is all of us the fact of the matter is the crowdsourcing of information and data are we actually doing the most efficient methodology to have clean water and the most efficient technology to have clean air how about in my financial world i sit on the financial services committee this is going to get a little geeky but in 2008 the bonds that were backed by mortgages blew up all of a sudden we found out there were lots and lots and lots of mortgages and deeds of trust rolled into these bonds that stopped performing there were lots of debates and discussions of these were toxic loans they were alta that were put into these bonds whatever the reason how did we not know so we set up a financial system that bundled these mortgages into bonds are you telling me that from the regulatory state if we had designed an informationbased regulatory system where those of uswhen i was maricopa county treasurer and you were looking at buying debt to park the cash you had so you would get a rate of return for your taxpayers you would pick up the phone and call moodys or call s p or call the rating and say hey is this a safe bond is this a rated is it aaa or whatever it is you would get a phone call back they would say yes it is fine that was your due diligence how about a system that uses information so the information flows saying hey the bond you are looking at you now have 5 percent of the loans on it that arent making their payments hey do you realize this bond has an intense geographic concentration so if something happens in that geography you are going to have ever greater difficulties all of a sudden the regulators that are built into the system come in and bayonet the wounded after the war is lost sorry that was one of my fathers favorite sayings but the fact of the matter is the way we do much of our regulation is after the sins have happened instead of using information to avoid the mistake in the beginning so i am making the argument that that type of revolutionary thinking in the way we as a society regulate will maximize economic growth on immigration you need to change this immigration system when you realize that twothirds of the immigration population is familialand i know this sets peoples hair on fire but if you are going to take in 1 million 1 2 million legal immigrants into the country this year you do realize twothirds of that population functionally gets to come to the united states because of a family member where much of the rest of the world whether it be australia new zealand great britain canada have moved to a system that maximizes talent because they figured out they desperately need economic growth to keep their commitments but there is a fourth one that is almost never talked about and i can actually start to see here in congress and i see it in our state legislatures and that is actually the new economy i promise sometime when we get back in january we are going to do a presentation of how the new economy can both change how the government functions but also if we can get out of its way it provides opportunity for everyone and hopefully maybe some escape velocity economically so let me throw you first just a simple concept how many of you out there have ever ridden in a ride share or seen these things they call like zipcar where you hit the button on your phone and you are able to just use a car why doesnt government do that i think we saw some data that there are 176 000 cars that are either owned or leased by the federal government we found one small agency that had more vehicles than employees so if i came to you right now and said lets rethink this does this agency here belong owning their own little vehicle fleet and this agency that is right next door belong owning theirs why wouldnt you pool them together and create a simple app that does two things it says the cars belong to everyone in the agency you hit the button and say i need to use one today and tomorrow i dont need one and oh by the way the technology says that i am going to this community and it tells you who else from the bureaucracy is also going in the same direction it is already happening in the private sector now think of it even more expansive why is it just the federal government why wouldnt it be your state your local your tribal another example we are working on right now in arizona and we are actually working on with some of my state legislators is this concept for capital assets i live in maricopa county it is maybe the third or fourth most populous county in the country it is made up of 30some cities and tribal communities how many of those communities own the really expensive earthmovers how many of those earthmovers are used to their max every single day if they are not why isnt a simple app created to share so do this tribal community this city this county and this government each need to own their own why arent they put on sharing platforms the concept is real simple capital assets need to be maximized it is like the concept of a classroom at 3 45 when school is out does that classroom become the community college at 7 30 does it become the senior learning class it is a building we are paying to heat and cool it it is there we spent the capital money how do you maximize the utilization of capital assets this is happening in the private world much of this technology is coming out of silicon valley and other hubs of innovation in our country we need to open ourselves up in the government and say we need to be embracing this technology to move it to ourselves in the last half of this i see fights starting to break out on the new technology and how it changes how we work it changes our optionality we need to understand that technology is changing our society but if we can get out of the way it can actually really provide us some opportunities so there are crazy thoughts we are researching these lets say you are one of these drivers whether it be an uber platform or something else and there is this argument saying well you are being treated as a selfemployed 1099 or you are getting direct payments electronically or you are doing airbnb or these sorts of things how is that going to help you fund your social security maybe we need to rethink it maybe it really is time to have that honest conversation of should you be allowed to have that account that is truly yours and set up your technology that every time you have a client and you take them and deliver them to a location every time you have guests in your airbnb every time you provide a certain service you can use that technology so that a little bit of that money goes to your retirement account we have the technology it would be a very lowcost way to do it and we start to engage in the technology revolution that is happening around us to basically embrace it not be scared of it and at the same time use that technology to shore up what we have just talked about the devastating actuarial math we are running into i know there is a political battle coming in this because for some of my brothers and sisters on the other side it is very much how do i unionize that population how do i do this type of control how do i have this for many of those on the more free market side we are making the argument for individuals to be able to use technology and the new economy to pursue their optionality maximizing the value of their time they need to be allowed to do that we are americans being free is part of the basicit is supposed to be part of our dna at the same time use that same creativity that same optionality to not be afraid of it but to use that technology to actually grow the economy and embrace the empowerment of individuals to deal with the very problems we were showing on those slides i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "chairman smith thank you so much for your leadership on behalf of these individuals thank you chairman royce for your strong leadership as well right now more than 20 million people worldwide are caught up in modernday slavery we call it human trafficking this isnt just a problem over there in the city i representcharlottemaria was trapped when she answered an ad for an aspiring actress rosa was snatched from a local gas station while waiting for a ride my good friend antonia childs dreamed of owning a bakery before falling victim to human trafficking thankfully antonia was rescued and now leads a vital charlotte organization rescuing women including maria and rosa as a nation we must take responsibility for our part in this horrific multibilliondollar illicit industry as members of congress we must take an active role in ending human trafficking worldwide that is why on january 22 2015 i became an original cosponsor in support of chairman smiths h r 515 the international megans law to prevent child exploitation h r 515 ensures foreign countries are notified when an american sex offender who has previously abused children is traveling to that country it encourages foreign countries to provide us with the same vital information when a sex offender is traveling to america it attacks the sickening practice of child sex tourism by requiring the united states to notify other countries when convicted pedophiles travel abroad it encourages president obama to use bilateral agreements and assistance to establish reciprocal notification so that we will know when convicted child offenders are coming here international megans law takes valuable lessons we have learned about protecting our children here in the united states and expands those protections globally so all communities can join together to take the necessary steps to protect our children please join me in taking this important step to end modern slavery today"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "congressman mckinley thank you for your leadership as chair of the coal caucus it does great work i am honored to be a part of it and i am honored to work with you as you well know and as the people of america need to know we are at a critical point in this war on coal and it truly is a war on coal coal is vital to the people of west virginia and to west virginias economy and to this country coal supports many crucial investments in southern west virginia in my congressional district its revenues help support tourism roads and infrastructure it will make king coal highway a reality and make sure we do not have a bridge to nowhere like we already have in southern west virginia coal puts food on the table coal pays the bills coal supports families coal generates the revenue that provides for our roads our schools our police and our fire departments coal keeps the lights on but sadly this administration doesnt recognize the value of coal or of the people who work to mine it they are proposing regulation after regulation to make it harder to mine coal harder to burn coal and harder to produce affordable energy from coal we have lost an estimated 43 percent of our coal jobs in just the last 6 years while that is a sobering number it is more than a statistic each one of those employees has responsibilities they have bills they have families they have rent or house payments how will they provide for themselves and others without their coal jobs we must stand up for west virginia jobs west virginia energy and west virginia coal that is exactly what i am doing in congress as a member of the house appropriations committee at one hearing i did ask epa administrator gina mccarthy to come to west virginia and listen to us she declined so i brought logan county coal miners to washington to testify before congress they shared how coal provides good paychecks to support their families and how they are worried overregulation will put them out of work i am working in congress to ensure our miners will be able to provide for their families and that our state still has access to affordable domestic energy i will continue to fight each and every day thank you for your leadership"]]}
