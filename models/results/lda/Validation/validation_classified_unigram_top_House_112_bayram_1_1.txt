defense has taken no steps to award combat benefits to the casualties or even officially recognize the attack as a terrorist incident the house and senate have included two reform measures in the ndaa which we just passed while additional attacks have been attempted by similar highprofile radical islamic terrorists it is past time for the government to deliver on this act here we are almost 3 years later and theres been a recent report that has come out and in that report it references this incident of this slaughter of american troops on fort hood soil in texas it references that it shall be taken up as part of workplace violence the obama regime calls the fort hood shooting workplace violence sure its workplace violence its where they work and its violence but we have a concept of what workplace violence is and your normal workplace violence is not preceded by a shout by the shooter god is great in the arabic language its not preceded by discussions by the alleged perpetrator its alleged because he hasnt been convicted yet and we in a free american world take the position that all are innocent until proven guilty so we will call him the alleged shooter but theres clear evidence in reports by the defense department and by reports by the news media reports by witnesses on the scene reports by his fellow soldiers reports by folks from walter reed hospital where this americantrained militarytrained doctor worked that he had advocated that the american soldier was wrong and that he was contrary and he spoke and preached islamic terrorism so your normal workplace violence thats not a part of the factor yet this is what happened in this case senator collins on wednesday blasted the defense department and bless her for it for classifying the fort hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nations armed forces at home ive been talking about this now since the day after this happened we cant have a world where political correctness fails to define the criminal act by its very nature whether were talking about military law and the criminal relations in military law were just talking about criminal acts in general we have to be able to define them just to make the system work we have to be able to define them but more importantly we owe a duty and a responsibility to the american soldier to call an event what it is and not try to put a smokescreen over it or cloud the issue or in any way worry about the feelings of groups because the definition is the definition this man identified himself that he was committing this act in the name of god is great in arabic he acknowledged when questioned that it was part of his mission he acknowledged that he had dealt with terrorist spokesmen in the past and that the concept came from his interaction with awlaki and others so this guy is an islamic terrorist theres no other way you can describe this gentleman but now years after the event as he sits in the bell county jail in belton texas we continue to have reports coming down from our defense department that the folks that are responsible for our soldiers and responsible for those who died in this incident want to downplay this to be treated as an incident of workplace violence with all the white bread connotation that that has to me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so lets look at some of the evidence we have that connects this to islamic terrorism recognizing the november 5 2009 attack on fort hood texas as an act of radical islamic terrorism and jihad anwar awlaki connection now mr awlaki is no longer with us we have taken that boy out yet the bottom line is at the time this happened they were directly connected this man preached taught and encouraged violenceislamic terrorist violence hasans presentations to the dod on jihad justification he would argue with his fellow soldiers about the justification for having jihad against the american military mr hasan was a member of the united states army he was a major he had been serving in the medical corps as a psychiatrist he was trained with american taxpayer dollars but he was preaching jihad to soldiers and there was lots of evidence i had a bill which was included in this recent defense bill that we just passed it said that this guy was telling people that hed believed in this kind of thing since medical school now hes a major serving as a psychiatrist advising our soldiers hasan purchased and practiced with highcapacity firearms prior to the attack he went out and he bought firearms he bought them at a local gun store of the guns that were used in the killings one of them was a semiautomatic weapon with a large magazine capacity he went out to the firing range and familiarized himself with these weapons prior to this incident you cant think of this as some guy who goes postal all of a sudden this guy was planning this whole event he shouts god is great in arabic before he starts shooting but they refer to it in the context of the broader threat of workplace violence i think there is a very good argument that the evidence shows this was a premeditated act on the part of major hasan and i believe when this case finally gets to trial that the evidence will be overwhelming that it was premeditated at the time of the event lieutenant general cone the iii corps commander at fort hood told nbcs today show on the friday after the shooting that the soldiers who witnessed the shooting rampage that left 13 people dead reported that the gunman shouted allahu akbar which means god is great before opening fire at the texas post the day after it was being reported that he did this yet in the initial report that came out from the defense department the mans name didnt even appear the relationship to any islamic terrorism was not referenced it was like any major from any outfit just wandered in and started shooting soldiers like he was having a bad day or something now we get another comment saying that were going to treat this in the bigger scope of workplace violence certainly we want to prevent workplace violence in every workplace but the connotation is that this is just something that happened its not something that just happened because quite honestly since that time others have been caught who reportedly were trying to imitate this shooter mr hasan we introduced a bill the fort hood families benefits protection act it would award both military and civilian casualties of the ford hood attack with combat status to ensure full benefits and eligibility for the purple heart and other awards and for the civilian award equivalence to the secretary of defenses defense of freedom medal now why did i ask for that because there was a precedent for it when they flew the plane into the pentagon on 9 11 this is what was the finding of the department of defensethat it was an act of terrorism and therefore they should be treated as combat casualties and those two medals were awarded this didnt just come off the top of my head this is what happened with the first terrorist attack in our country and with the second or third or whatever attack this one was when this man walked into that room there were people in civilian garb and there were people in uniform he went out of his way to shoot the people in uniform the civilians who were injured were injured because of misfire or misdirection as he walked down that line his target was all of those soldiers who were doing nothing more than either coming back from being off post and out of the countryor wherever theyd beenor preparing for their next duty stations wherever they may be goingiraq or afghanistan they were being processed and they were in this big room he walked down the line shooting everybody in uniform now when youre killing our combat soldiers and when youre crying out slogans of the jihad terrorists why wouldnt you think its a terrorist attack and why shouldnt these people who died in the line of duty be treated like those at the pentagon who died in the line of duty in fact except for what we were able to put together in circumstantial evidence after the fact at the time of the incident we had no idea who flew that plane into the pentagon we just made an educated guess in this case before this shooting started the guy identified himself and what his mission was for some reason in this world of political correctness someone has the idea that this is good for the morale of our military soldiers or that its good for something as i think the chief of staff said when this happened oh this is sure going to hurt our islamic outreach program whether its good for that or not i hold nothing against the islamic people nor does anybody at fort hood but we hold a lot against islamic terrorists who kill soldiers and the department of defense should have the guts to step up and to stand up for these soldiers i see my good

because it was after midnight when obamacare passed it was on that time the strategy that i put together then was that we would file a repeal bill seek the maximum number of cosponsors to repeal obamacare and then move forward with the discharge petition to seek to get 218 signatures on that so that thenspeaker pelosi couldnt block the repeal from coming to the floor we followed through on all of that to the point where we peaked out at 178 signatures on the discharge petition that could have circumvented the speaker seeking to block the repeal of obamacare that discharge petition was one of the tools that was useful in winning the majority on november 2 of this past year and there are members here that openly say they wouldnt be here if they didnt have the discharge petition to point to their opponent and say sign the discharge petition if youre serious if youre against obamacare heres the vehicle to repeal it sign it a number of those who did not and would not were voted out of office and we have a new freshman class here that is 96 strong 87 of them are republicans and i know of none of the 87 that did not run on the repeal of obamacare i dont have confirmation but i believe that every one of the freshmen republicans the 87 ran at least in part if not centrally on working to repeal obamacare after winning the majority so we could actually bring legislation to repeal obamacare the next phase was to bring a repeal bill here to the floor of the house i wanted it to be h r 1 it turned out to be h r 2 i dont know what h r 1 is yet but im very very happy that the leadership took that high a priority to hold a vote here in the house to repeal obamacare so early in the first session of the 112th congress we saw a vote here that was bipartisan and it was unanimous among republicans to repeal obamacare that is a very sound a ringing sound rejection of obamacare by the american people as a result of the election of november 2 by the people they sent here 87 new freshmen republican many of them very very solid then after h r 2 passed the house with unanimous republican support and bipartisan support it went over to the senate where they said it could never pass over here and its a symbolic vote well the republican leader mitch mcconnell did force a vote on the repeal of obamacare it would have taken 60 votes to break the filibuster under those rules well every republican in the united states senate voted to repeal obamacare so we are in this situation today where if you look in the house and in the senate with far larger republican numbers than we have had in past years every republican in the house and the senate has voted to repeal obamacare every single one they are serious and they want to get the job done and their constituents insist that we get the job done as well so now that we have taken this position that we are all of us for repealing obamacare and consistent with two thirds of the american people if we voted to repeal it it would be completely inconsistent for us to vote then to turn around and fund obamacare well if the cr has language in it that allows for funding of obamacare then a vote in support of the continuing resolution is a vote that funds the very thing that we voted to repeal which would be inconsistent and i do not believe that we will have inconsistent members here in the house of representatives i think they voted to repeal obamacare i think they are happy to vote to cut off the funding to obamacare and i believe that we will have universal support for that among our conference and i believe the senate if they have an opportunity for the vote would do the same thing down party lines perhaps but they would do the same thing but herein is the difficulty and its this that the funding that might otherwise be in this continuing resolution or may perhaps actually come out tomorrow in it is not very large in comparison to the overall cost the chairman of the budget committee has said that the spending under obamacare is 2 6 trillion 2 6 trillion now there are taxes enacted by it and we know how the cbo scored the information that they were given but 2 6 trillion in spending would be shut off if we repealed obamacare today we have voted to do so in the house the senate wasnt successful the president likely would veto it is his signature bill it is his identity he is the one that called it obamacare at the blair house february 25 and now its in our dictionary my spell check spells it out for me obamacare but in any case the 1 billion or so that might be cut out of obamacare in the cr if we say none of the funds that are written into this bill can be used to implement or enforce obamacare that 1 billion pales by comparison to the funds that are automatically appropriated that are written into the obamacare bill itself and it is an unusual practice to have that happen when you have a large authorization bill like obamacare come through generally it authorizes the appropriations they are authorized to be appropriated under this section x many dollars to go to implement or enforce the various provisions of obamacare thats where the money is and the real money thats up in that thats automatically appropriated obamacare anticipates and authorizes trillions of dollars to be appropriated to fund it and it authorizes the collection of i believe trillions of dollars in fees and taxes to fund it over time but the automatic appropriations that are unusual but written into obamacare that a lot of people didnt know was in there when it was voted on they will automatically appropriate a number that approaches or exceeds 100 billion in automatic appropriations we are crunching these numbers now and i have to qualify these numbers our low number is down around 65 3 billion our upper number is up around 107 billion crs doesnt have a number cbo doesnt have a number apparently nobody has pressed them to produce the numbers of the automatic appropriations in obamacare in all this time so we are taking this apart and putting it back together and thats why the range is its my shop doing the math on this range 65 3 billion on the low side 107 billion on the high side lets just call it around 100 billion for round figures we could come here on the floor next week and debate a cr and we could see an amendment come thats in order that would cut off all funding in the cr that would be used to fund obamacare if we do that we are cutting off about 1 2 billion in spending if we bring an amendment that shuts off all the funding thats automatically appropriated in obamacare and if we are successful we shut off maybe 100 billion that would be used to implement and enforce obamacare one billion versus 100 billion a 1 percent solution versus a 100 percent solution and if we dont use the 100 percent solution then 100 billion as much as or perhaps more will be aggressively used by the obama administration to implement and enforce obamacare and if they do that the cancerous tumor thats growing because of what it does to our liberty and our freedom sends its roots down deeper and it gets bigger and stronger and harder to eradicate that is part of the strategy so i am hopeful that leadership and the chairman of the appropriations committee will get together and sometime tonight as they put the finishing touches on the cr legislation that they say will come out tomorrow that they will write into the bill the language that i have proposed and since we deal with 2 500 page bills here in the house and we are chastised if we dont read and understand every word of them i have an amendment here that i can read every word of and perhaps it could be understood by everyone in america this is the amendment that shuts off the automatic appropriations to obamacare it is this and i quote notwithstanding any other provision of law none of the funds made available in this act or any previous or subsequent act may be used to carry out the provisions of public law 111148 public law 111152 or any amendment made by either such public law thats the amendment that shuts off not just the funding in the cr to obamacare but it shuts off the selfenacting automatic appropriations that were i believe inappropriately written into the obamacare bill and the reconciliation package that came over from the senate as part of their deal that is why i gave you two bill numbers instead of one but they encompass what we commonly refer to as obamacare that is the amendment that needs to be made in order here on the floor that allows the house to work its will that allows the house to work within order under the rules and by the way regular order is holding committee meetings holding hearings holding subcommittee markups and subcommittee appropriations chairman rehberg would be seated at one of those markups i would think and that would be useful a full appropriations committee markup at all of those stops there would be an opportunity to introduce this language in committee and then succeed i believe in dealing with a parliamentary challenge or if its written into the base bill certainly there would be no parliamentary challenge and if this goes out of the appropriations committee up to the rules committee and doesnt have my language in it at that point the rules committee can protect this language from a point of order but if i bring this language to the floor under an appropriations bill i know that i am facing a parliamentary challenge to this language and it will be hard for the house to work its will if we get to the point where we have a parliamentary challenge on a piece of language that mirrors the will of the american people mirrors the wishes of the american people and mirrors the will and wishes of the members of congress the majority of the members of congress and mirrors the will and the wishes and the votes of 100 percent of the republicans in the united states house and the united states senate and is bipartisan at least in the house that is the endeavor that we need to be successful with and i am very determined to have this kind of debate and find a way to have this vote if we are blocked from a vote that is essential to work the will of the house how then can we say how then can we say that the house has worked its will if the house has been denied an opportunity to work its will i know there are arguments on both sides but i would point out that the language that i have read into the record is not a precedent it doesnt stretch the rules or the history or the traditions of this house it doesnt stretch any written rule that i know of and it is this there is ample precedent ample precedent in the form of the appropriations bills that were used to shut off the funding for the vietnam war now i disagreed with the decision back then i remember reading about it in the news in 1973 and 1974 in fact my recollection says also 1975 but i dont

amendments to h r 1627 would improve the accountability and transparency of the department of veterans affairs ensuring that va is responsible to those it serves our american veterans as the title of this bill implies this legislation would authorize va health care services for veterans and their families for certain illnesses that manifested as a result of exposure to water contamination at camp lejeune north carolina during a 30year span that ended in 1987 i want to specifically acknowledge the efforts of retired marine master sergeant jerry ensminger whose dogged efforts to seek answers from the government and justice for the victims of the water contamination inspired this bill in honor of jerrys daughter janey who died of leukemia at the age of 9 after time spent at camp lejeune when the water was contaminated title i of this bill bears her name finally i thank representative brad miller and senator richard burr the original sponsors of the camp lejeune legislation in the house and the senate for their leadership and although this legislation represents a hardfought victory we must not forget those who are no longer with us to see it become law i think when senator burr said this he said it best unfortunately many who were exposed have died as a result and are not here to receive the care this bill can provide while i wish we could have accomplished this years ago we now have the opportunity to do the right thing for thousands who were harmed during their service to our country and i couldnt agree more in addition to the veterans of camp lejeune section 106 of this bill contains legislation the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health ms buerkle introduced h r 2074 the veterans sexual assault prevention act the section and her bill which passed the house last year would address the serious failure of the department of veterans affairs to prevent and report sexual assault incidents and corresponding flaws in the security of their facilities it creates a fundamentally safer environment for our veterans and va employees by requiring an accountable and comprehensive oversight system i want to express my personal appreciation to ms buerkle for her advocacy on behalf of women and all of our veterans in just 2 short years she has proven herself to be a committed and strong voice for servicemembers and veterans not only in the state of new york but across this country her considerable expertise as a nurse a lawyer and a mother of six was the reason i chose her to be the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health and i can tell you that in the roll that she has played she has never wavered from doing what is right for all of our veterans the bill also includes several worthy legislative proposals to improve health care services brought forth from our members on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers the house and in the senate this bill also addresses several other areas where we will be able to expand and improve health care for veterans it would allow for greater flexibility in va payments to state veterans homes break down barriers to care for veterans with traumatic brain injury clarify the access rights of service dogs on va property and improve care for rural elderly and homeless veterans this bill also addresses several important matters related to veterans housing because many of our returning wounded warriors need assistance modifying their residences to meet their needs this bill would reauthorize and expand several provisions relating to the specially adapted housing grant program these grants provide funding to eligible disabled veterans and servicemembers who adapt homes that they own or homes that they are currently living in to meet their daily needs adaptations can include grab bars in bathrooms widening doorways for wheelchairs or constructing a wheelchair ramp these grants are imperative to affording veterans the level of independent living that they were accustomed to prior to their injury and that they may not be able to otherwise enjoy as many of us are aware far too many of our veterans have found themselves on hard times and are homeless or are at risk for homelessness to combat this problem this bill would authorize funding for additional housing options for homeless veterans to help them gain stability and obtain access to other treatment and services that they may need from va the next area of the bill would be in addressing education we all know that we have provided a very generous benefit to the veterans in the post9 11 gi bill the problem is that we have never really tracked the performance of the bill or if the benefits are effective in training veterans to be leaders of tomorrow therefore this legislation would increase our oversight of post9 11 educational benefits by requiring annual reports to congress on the effectiveness of these benefits and how theyre being utilized i want to thank my friend congressman gus bilirakis for introducing this provision in h r 2274 and for his leadership on improving transparency for the post9 11 gi bill another critical area addressed by this legislation is that of veteran benefits over the last 3 years weve seen the disability claims backlog grow exponentially with more than 900 000 claims now awaiting decisions fifty percent of those have been pending for a period of 125 days or more despite repeated promises from va to break the backlog it continues to grow therefore the provisions of this bill that address benefit matters will assist in processing claims more efficiently first it would allow veterans to automatically waive regional office review of evidence submitted directly to the board of veterans appeals for claims in appellate status second it would allow veterans in need of assistance with claims to have a signatory on their behalf assist them with the claims process third it would modernize vas statutory duty to assist by authorizing electronic communications potentially saving weeks in a claims processing time fourth to alleviate the burdens of redundant paperwork veterans would now be able to file jointly for social security and indemnity compensation finally to promote accountability of individual claims processors va would be required to present a plan in 6 months on how it will take corrective action when their employees need training to do their jobs well i want to thank my friend mr runyan from new jersey the chairman of the subcommittee on disability assistance and memorial affairs for his dedication to our nations veterans and for his focus on advancing legislation such as h r 2349 which will achieve measurable results in alleviating the backlog of claims while many of these provisions that i have discussed thus far have focused on our efforts to honor our commitment to the brave men and women who serve our nation including those transitioning from the recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan we must also continue our commitment to our fallen heroes accordingly this bill also sets out specific criteria that prohibit disruptions and protests of funerals of members of the armed forces at va national cemeteries and at arlington national cemetery including the imposition of criminal and civil liability for violations of these restrictions in addition given the sacred nature of arlington national cemetery a name synonymous with honoring american freedom this legislation would codify a prohibition on the reservation of grave sites at arlington national cemetery with very limited exceptions i worked closely with mr runyan on this prohibition to ensure that many future generations of american heroes will be buried and honored at arlington national cemetery i want to thank him again for his leadership on this issue and for originally introducing h r 1484 similarly i introduced the original measure on h r 1627 which would place restrictions on the type and placement of monuments at arlington national cemetery due to the fact that the cemetery itself is a monument arlington national cemetery is a unique national treasure it is for this reason that this legislation is necessary to ensure that the integrity of the cemetery is preserved both in its utilization of land with the placement of monuments and with its allocation of grave sites finally this comprehensive legislative package also contains several miscellaneous provisions affecting our nations veterans although these areas may not receive as much attention such as health care or benefits they are no less important to improving

in responding to the crisis diminish their incentives curb their entrepreneurship and make them feel unsure about the climate in which they are working the recovery becomes uncertain that was tony blair then thomas donohue the president of our national chamber of commerce said at a jobs submit about a year and a half ago here in washington the regulatory activity presently going on is so far above and beyond anything we have ever seen in the history of this country that we are in danger of becoming a government of by and for the regulators instead of a government of by and for the people i thought of these two things when i read a letter recently from one of my constituents who runs a small bank in east tennessee he wrote to me he said one of the single greatest needs of small business is access to capital and much of that small business lending capital is typically provided by americas more than 6 700 community banks yet community banks are by and large being forced to withhold and constrain lending at the time america needs it most this is largely due to unprecedented onerous regulatory constraints being placed on community banks by federal bank examiners he goes on and says this never in modern history have banks especially community banks been under great pressure by banking regulators much of that pressure is unprecedented virtually ignoring or redefining historic standards and definitions of bank examining routinely banks are being required by bank examiners to classify and put into a nonaccrual status loans that are current on their payments in many cases this be can far more than half of all of the classified loan assets this is enormously inconsistent with historic bank examination practices and i go on quoting from this letter in most cases this results in a banks capital being constrained and consequently may well lead to a forced merger of these banks by the fed into the larger banks despite acknowledgement by the fed that the two big banks represent a systemic threat to the unitedstates and global banking systems the big banks seemingly are allowed to keep getting bigger that is a serious problem it was the toobigtofail banks that got us into the mess that we got into in the first place and now many of the smallest banks in this country are being forced out of existence or forced to merge so the big keep getting bigger and the small and the mediumsized ones are having a real struggle to survive finally this bank who wrote to me said if america is going to have economic recovery and jobs depend on it banks must not only be allowed to lend but encouraged to lend instead they are largely being constrained from lending with much of that constraint attributable to overly aggressive bank examination by and large most unitedstates banks are having to shrink in size in response to the feds pressure which translates into reduced lending we have been going through a period of time in which president bush and his secretary of the treasury at the tail end of their administration started saying this and then president obama and his secretary of the treasury then saying it they have been saying loan loan loan and

31 individuals were wounded in a shooting attack at fort hood texas on november 5 2009 since that time the department of defense has taken no steps to award combat benefits to the casualties or even officially recognize the attack as a terrorist incident the house and senate have included two reform measures in the ndaa which we just passed while additional attacks have been attempted by similar highprofile radical islamic terrorists it is past time for the government to deliver on this act here we are almost 3 years later and theres been a recent report that has come out and in that report it references this incident of this slaughter of american troops on fort hood soil in texas it references that it shall be taken up as part of workplace violence the obama regime calls the fort hood shooting workplace violence sure its workplace violence its where they work and its violence but we have a concept of what workplace violence is and your normal workplace violence is not preceded by a shout by the shooter god is great in the arabic language its not preceded by discussions by the alleged perpetrator its alleged because he hasnt been convicted yet and we in a free american world take the position that all are innocent until proven guilty so we will call him the alleged shooter but theres clear evidence in reports by the defense department and by reports by the news media reports by witnesses on the scene reports by his fellow soldiers reports by folks from walter reed hospital where this americantrained militarytrained doctor worked that he had advocated that the american soldier was wrong and that he was contrary and he spoke and preached islamic terrorism so your normal workplace violence thats not a part of the factor yet this is what happened in this case senator collins on wednesday blasted the defense department and bless her for it for classifying the fort hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nations armed forces at home ive been talking about this now since the day after this happened we cant have a world where political correctness fails to define the criminal act by its very nature whether were talking about military law and the criminal relations in military law were just talking about criminal acts in general we have to be able to define them just to make the system work we have to be able to define them but more importantly we owe a duty and a responsibility to the american soldier to call an event what it is and not try to put a smokescreen over it or cloud the issue or in any way worry about the feelings of groups because the definition is the definition this man identified himself that he was committing this act in the name of god is great in arabic he acknowledged when questioned that it was part of his mission he acknowledged that he had dealt with terrorist spokesmen in the past and that the concept came from his interaction with awlaki and others so this guy is an islamic terrorist theres no other way you can describe this gentleman but now years after the event as he sits in the bell county jail in belton texas we continue to have reports coming down from our defense department that the folks that are responsible for our soldiers and responsible for those who died in this incident want to downplay this to be treated as an incident of workplace violence with all the white bread connotation that that has to me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so lets look at some of the evidence we have that connects this to islamic terrorism recognizing the november 5 2009 attack on fort hood texas as an act of radical islamic terrorism and jihad anwar awlaki connection now mr awlaki is no longer with us we have taken that boy out yet the bottom line is at the time this happened they were directly connected this man preached taught and encouraged violenceislamic terrorist violence hasans presentations to the dod on jihad justification he would argue with his fellow soldiers about the justification for having jihad against the american military mr hasan was a member of the united states army he was a major he had been serving in the medical corps as a psychiatrist he was trained with american taxpayer dollars but he was preaching jihad to soldiers and there was lots of evidence i had a bill which was included in this recent defense bill that we just passed it said that this guy was telling people that hed believed in this kind of thing since medical school now hes a major serving as a psychiatrist advising our soldiers hasan purchased and practiced with highcapacity firearms prior to the attack he went out and he bought firearms he bought them at a local gun store of the guns that were used in the killings one of them was a semiautomatic weapon with a large magazine capacity he went out to the firing range and familiarized himself with these weapons prior to this incident you cant think of this as some guy who goes postal all of a sudden this guy was planning this whole event he shouts god is great in arabic before he starts shooting but they refer to it in the context of the broader threat of workplace violence i think there is a very good argument that the evidence shows this was a premeditated act on the part of major hasan and i believe when this case finally gets to trial that the evidence will be overwhelming that it was premeditated at the time of the event lieutenant general cone the iii corps commander at fort hood told nbcs today show on the friday after the shooting that the soldiers who witnessed the shooting rampage that left 13 people dead reported that the gunman shouted allahu akbar which means god is great before opening fire at the texas post the day after it was being reported that he did this yet in the initial report that came out from the defense department the mans name didnt even appear the relationship to any islamic terrorism was not referenced it was like any major from any outfit just wandered in and started shooting soldiers like he was having a bad day or something now we get another comment saying that were going to treat this in the bigger scope of workplace violence certainly we want to prevent workplace violence in every workplace but the connotation is that this is just something that happened its not something that just happened because quite honestly since that time others have been caught who reportedly were trying to imitate this shooter mr hasan we introduced a bill the fort hood families benefits protection act it would award both military and civilian casualties of the ford hood attack with combat status to ensure full benefits and eligibility for the purple heart and other awards and for the civilian award equivalence to the secretary of defenses defense of freedom medal now why did i ask for that because there was a precedent for it when they flew the plane into the pentagon on 9 11 this is what was the finding of the department of defensethat it was an act of terrorism and therefore they should be treated as combat casualties and those two medals were awarded this didnt just come off the top of my head this is what happened with the first terrorist attack in our country and with the second or third or whatever attack this one was when this man walked into that room there were people in civilian garb and there were people in uniform he went out of his way to shoot the people in uniform the civilians who were injured were injured because of misfire or misdirection as he walked down that line his target was all of those soldiers who were doing nothing more than either coming back from being off post and out of the countryor wherever theyd beenor preparing for their next duty stations wherever they may be goingiraq or afghanistan they were being processed and they were in this big room he walked down the line shooting everybody in uniform now when youre killing our combat soldiers and when youre crying out slogans of the jihad terrorists why wouldnt you think its a terrorist attack and why shouldnt these people who died in the line of duty be treated like those at the pentagon who died in the line of duty in fact except for what we were able to put together in circumstantial evidence after the fact at the time of the incident we had no idea who flew that plane into the pentagon we just made an educated guess in this case before this shooting started the guy identified himself and what his mission was for some reason in this world of political correctness someone has the idea that this is good for the morale of our military soldiers or that its good for something as i think the chief of staff said when this happened oh this is sure going to hurt our islamic outreach program whether its good for that or not i hold nothing against the islamic people nor does anybody at fort hood but we hold a lot against islamic terrorists who kill soldiers and the

obamacare so early in the first session of the 112th congress we saw a vote here that was bipartisan and it was unanimous among republicans to repeal obamacare that is a very sound a ringing sound rejection of obamacare by the american people as a result of the election of november 2 by the people they sent here 87 new freshmen republican many of them very very solid then after h r 2 passed the house with unanimous republican support and bipartisan support it went over to the senate where they said it could never pass over here and its a symbolic vote well the republican leader mitch mcconnell did force a vote on the repeal of obamacare it would have taken 60 votes to break the filibuster under those rules well every republican in the united states senate voted to repeal obamacare so we are in this situation today where if you look in the house and in the senate with far larger republican numbers than we have had in past years every republican in the house and the senate has voted to repeal obamacare every single one they are serious and they want to get the job done and their constituents insist that we get the job done as well so now that we have taken this position that we are all of us for repealing obamacare and consistent with two thirds of the american people if we voted to repeal it it would be completely inconsistent for us to vote then to turn around and fund obamacare well if the cr has language in it that allows for funding of obamacare then a vote in support of the continuing resolution is a vote that funds the very thing that we voted to repeal which would be inconsistent and i do not believe that we will have inconsistent members here in the house of representatives i think they voted to repeal obamacare i think they are happy to vote to cut off the funding to obamacare and i believe that we will have universal support for that among our conference and i believe the senate if they have an opportunity for the vote would do the same thing down party lines perhaps but they would do the same thing but herein is the difficulty and its this that the funding that might otherwise be in this continuing resolution or may perhaps actually come out tomorrow in it is not very large in comparison to the overall cost the chairman of the budget committee has said that the spending under obamacare is 2 6 trillion 2 6 trillion now there are taxes enacted by it and we know how the cbo scored the information that they were given but 2 6 trillion in spending would be shut off if we repealed obamacare today we have voted to do so in the house the senate wasnt successful the president likely would veto it is his signature bill it is his identity he is the one that called it obamacare at the blair house february 25 and now its in our dictionary my spell check spells it out for me obamacare but in any case the 1 billion or so that might be cut out of obamacare in the cr if we say none of the funds that are written into this bill can be used to implement or enforce obamacare that 1 billion pales by comparison to the funds that are automatically appropriated that are written into the obamacare bill itself and it is an unusual practice to have that happen when you have a large authorization bill like obamacare come through generally it authorizes the appropriations they are authorized to be appropriated under this section x many dollars to go to implement or enforce the various provisions of obamacare thats where the money is and the real money thats up in that thats automatically appropriated obamacare anticipates and authorizes trillions of dollars to be appropriated to fund it and it authorizes the collection of i believe trillions of dollars in fees and taxes to fund it over time but the automatic appropriations that are unusual but written into obamacare that a lot of people didnt know was in there when it was voted on they will automatically appropriate a number that approaches or exceeds 100 billion in automatic appropriations we are crunching these numbers now and i have to qualify these numbers our low number is down around 65 3 billion our upper number is up around 107 billion crs doesnt have a number cbo doesnt have a number apparently nobody has pressed them to produce the numbers of the automatic appropriations in obamacare in all this time so we are taking this apart and putting it back together and thats why the range is its my shop doing the math on this range 65 3 billion on the low side 107 billion on the high side lets just call it around 100 billion for round figures we could come here on the floor next week and debate a cr and we could see an amendment come thats in order that would cut off all funding in the cr that would be used to fund obamacare if we do that we are cutting off about 1 2 billion in spending if we bring an amendment that shuts off all the funding thats automatically appropriated in obamacare and if we are successful we shut off maybe 100 billion that would be used to implement and enforce obamacare one billion versus 100 billion a 1 percent solution versus a 100 percent solution and if we dont use the 100 percent solution then 100 billion as much as or perhaps more will be aggressively used by the obama administration to implement and enforce obamacare and if they do that the cancerous tumor thats growing because of what it does to our liberty and our freedom sends its roots down deeper and it gets bigger and stronger and harder to eradicate that is part of the strategy so i am hopeful that leadership and the chairman of the appropriations committee will get together and sometime tonight as they put the finishing touches on the cr legislation that they say will come out tomorrow that they will write into the bill the language that i have proposed and since we deal with 2 500 page bills here in the house and we are chastised if we dont read and understand every word of them i have an amendment here that i can read every word of and perhaps it could be understood by everyone in america this is the amendment that shuts off the automatic appropriations to obamacare it is this and i quote notwithstanding any other provision of law none of the funds made available in this act or any previous or subsequent act may be used to carry out the provisions of public law 111148 public law 111152 or any amendment made by either such public law thats the amendment that shuts off not just the funding in the cr to obamacare but it shuts off the selfenacting automatic appropriations that were i believe inappropriately written into the obamacare bill and the reconciliation package that came over from the senate as part of their deal that is why i gave you two bill numbers instead of one but they encompass what we commonly refer to as obamacare that is the amendment that needs to be made in order here on the floor that allows the house to work its will that allows the house to work within order under the rules and by the way regular order is holding committee meetings holding hearings holding subcommittee markups and subcommittee appropriations chairman rehberg would be seated at one of those markups i would think and that would be useful a full appropriations committee markup at all of those stops there would be an opportunity to introduce this language in committee and then succeed i believe in dealing with a parliamentary challenge or if its written into the base bill certainly there would be no parliamentary challenge and if this goes out of the appropriations committee up to the rules committee and doesnt have my language in it at that point the rules committee can protect this language from a point of order but if i bring this language to the floor under an appropriations bill i know that i am facing a parliamentary challenge to this language and it will be hard for the house to work its will if we get to the point where we have a parliamentary challenge on a piece of language that mirrors the will of the american people mirrors the wishes of the american people and mirrors the will and wishes of the members of congress the majority of the members of congress and mirrors the will and the wishes and the votes of 100 percent of the republicans in the united states house and the united states senate and is bipartisan at least in the house that is the endeavor that we need to be successful with and i am very determined to have this kind of debate and find a way to have this vote if we are blocked from a vote that is essential to work the will of the house how then can we say how then can we say that the house has worked its will if the house has been denied an opportunity to work its will i know there are arguments on both sides but i would point out that the language that i have read into the record is not a precedent it doesnt stretch the rules or the history or the traditions of this house it doesnt stretch any written rule that i know of and it is this there is ample precedent ample precedent in the form of the appropriations bills that were used to shut off the funding for the vietnam war now i disagreed with the decision back then i remember reading about it in the news in 1973 and 1974 in fact my recollection says also 1975 but i dont happen to have those notes but i do have the notes to draw from a report by crs out of the

negotiations and we fought hard for commonsense transportation reforms this bill streamlines the environmental review process consolidates and eliminates duplicative programs and provides more flexibility to the states passing this legislation will provide job security for millions of americans im grateful to my house and senate colleagues that stood with me in opposing an amendment that was in the senate bill this amendment unfairly punished the state of indiana for pursuing a publicprivate partnership not only would it have cost indiana millions in transportation funding but it would have set our country backwards in innovative transportation policy this type of thinking is not where we need to be headed in transportation policy we need to put taxpayers first and continue to engage the private sector in transportation projects i would like to thank the house and senate staff who have been working tirelessly on the legislation i thank chairman mica senator boxer and senator inhofe for their leadership on this issue thanks to everybodys work 25 000 hoosiers will have job security for the next 2 years i urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and lets

committee on veterans affairs i rise in support of the senate amendments to h r 1627 this is a comprehensive bipartisan bicameral legislative package to provide for the needs of veterans their families and survivors through improved health care housing education and memorial services in addition the senate amendments to h r 1627 would improve the accountability and transparency of the department of veterans affairs ensuring that va is responsible to those it serves our american veterans as the title of this bill implies this legislation would authorize va health care services for veterans and their families for certain illnesses that manifested as a result of exposure to water contamination at camp lejeune north carolina during a 30year span that ended in 1987 i want to specifically acknowledge the efforts of retired marine master sergeant jerry ensminger whose dogged efforts to seek answers from the government and justice for the victims of the water contamination inspired this bill in honor of jerrys daughter janey who died of leukemia at the age of 9 after time spent at camp lejeune when the water was contaminated title i of this bill bears her name finally i thank representative brad miller and senator richard burr the original sponsors of the camp lejeune legislation in the house and the senate for their leadership and although this legislation represents a hardfought victory we must not forget those who are no longer with us to see it become law i think when senator burr said this he said it best unfortunately many who were exposed have died as a result and are not here to receive the care this bill can provide while i wish we could have accomplished this years ago we now have the opportunity to do the right thing for thousands who were harmed during their service to our country and i couldnt agree more in addition to the veterans of camp lejeune section 106 of this bill contains legislation the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health ms buerkle introduced h r 2074 the veterans sexual assault prevention act the section and her bill which passed the house last year would address the serious failure of the department of veterans affairs to prevent and report sexual assault incidents and corresponding flaws in the security of their facilities it creates a fundamentally safer environment for our veterans and va employees by requiring an accountable and comprehensive oversight system i want to express my personal appreciation to ms buerkle for her advocacy on behalf of women and all of our veterans in just 2 short years she has proven herself to be a committed and strong voice for servicemembers and veterans not only in the state of new york but across this country her considerable expertise as a nurse a lawyer and a mother of six was the reason i chose her to be the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health and i can tell you that in the roll that she has played she has never wavered from doing what is right for all of our veterans the bill also includes several worthy legislative proposals to improve health care services brought forth from our members on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers the house and in the senate this bill also addresses several other areas where we will be able to expand and improve health care for veterans it would allow for greater flexibility in va payments to state veterans homes break down barriers to care for veterans with traumatic brain injury clarify the access rights of service dogs on va property and improve care for rural elderly and homeless veterans this bill also addresses several important matters related to veterans housing because many of our returning wounded warriors need assistance modifying their residences to meet their needs this bill would reauthorize and expand several provisions relating to the specially adapted housing grant program these grants provide funding to eligible disabled veterans and servicemembers who adapt homes that they own or homes that they are currently living in to meet their daily needs adaptations can include grab bars in bathrooms widening doorways for wheelchairs or constructing a wheelchair ramp these grants are imperative to affording veterans the level of independent living that they were accustomed to prior to their injury and that they may not be able to otherwise enjoy as many of us are aware far too many of our veterans have found themselves on hard times and are homeless or are at risk for homelessness to combat this problem this bill would authorize funding for additional housing options for homeless veterans to help them gain stability and obtain access to other treatment and services that they may need from va the next area of the bill would be in addressing education we all know that we have provided a very generous benefit to the veterans in the post9 11 gi bill the problem is that we have never really tracked the performance of the bill or if the benefits are effective in training veterans to be leaders of tomorrow therefore this legislation would increase our oversight of post9 11 educational benefits by requiring annual reports to congress on the effectiveness of these benefits and how theyre being utilized i want to thank my friend congressman gus bilirakis for introducing this provision in h r 2274 and for his leadership on improving transparency for the post9 11 gi bill another critical area addressed by this legislation is that of veteran benefits over the last 3 years weve seen the disability claims backlog grow exponentially with more than 900 000 claims now awaiting decisions fifty percent of those have been pending for a period of 125 days or more despite repeated promises from va to break the backlog it continues to grow therefore the provisions of this bill that address benefit matters will assist in processing claims more efficiently first it would allow veterans to automatically waive regional office review of evidence submitted directly to the board of veterans appeals for claims in appellate status second it would allow veterans in need of assistance with claims to have a signatory on their behalf assist them with the claims process third it would modernize vas statutory duty to assist by authorizing electronic communications potentially saving weeks in a claims processing time fourth to alleviate the burdens of redundant paperwork veterans would now be able to file jointly for social security and indemnity compensation finally to promote accountability of individual claims processors va would be required to present a plan in 6 months on how it will take corrective action when their employees need training to do their jobs well i want to thank my friend mr runyan from new jersey the chairman of the subcommittee on disability assistance and memorial affairs for his dedication to our nations veterans and for his focus on advancing legislation such as h r 2349 which will achieve measurable results in alleviating the backlog of claims while many of these provisions that i have discussed thus far have focused on our efforts to honor our commitment to the brave men and women who serve our nation including those transitioning from the recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan we must also continue our commitment to our fallen heroes accordingly this bill also sets out specific criteria that prohibit disruptions and protests of funerals of members of the armed forces at va national cemeteries and at arlington national cemetery including the imposition of criminal and civil liability for violations of these restrictions in addition given the sacred nature of arlington national cemetery a name synonymous with honoring american freedom this legislation would codify a prohibition on the reservation of grave sites at arlington national cemetery with very limited exceptions i worked closely with mr runyan on this prohibition to ensure that many future generations of american heroes will be buried and honored at arlington national cemetery i want to thank him again for his leadership on this issue and for originally introducing h r 1484 similarly i introduced the original measure on h r 1627 which would place restrictions on the type and placement of monuments at arlington national cemetery due to the fact that the cemetery itself is a monument arlington national cemetery is a unique national treasure it is for this reason that this legislation is necessary to ensure that the integrity of the cemetery is preserved both in its utilization of land with the placement of monuments and with its allocation of grave sites finally this comprehensive legislative package also contains several miscellaneous provisions affecting our nations veterans although these areas may not receive as much attention such as health care or benefits they are no less important to improving the lives of the veterans of this country i want to thank the ranking member"]]}
