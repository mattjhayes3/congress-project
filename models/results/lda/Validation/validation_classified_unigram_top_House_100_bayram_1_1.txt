sophisticated military material to enable yugoslavia to modernize its defense forces yugoslav sources explained that they could produce spare parts more cheaply than could united states plants

similar to our state department treatment of romania the fiction is preserved that romania too is communism with a difference and despite its horrifying human rights record mostfavorednation treatment is allegedly a way of wooing ceaucescu from the soviet orbit our former ambassador to romania david funderburk in his book pinstripes and reds explodes this myth but not the momentum in the bowels of state that continues to push for such policies the yugoslavs can indeed produce united states military equipment more cheaply than can unitedstates plants workers on the production line at the yugo plant make as little as 25 cents an hour certainly this is a factor behind the anticipated mass strikes in yugoslavia this fall as it should be any american concerned about fair labor standards and unfair trade practices should keep this in mind before considering purchase of a yugo car given this grass exploitation moreover the communist dictators of yugoslavia share another common feature with

consistent behavior by an arms supplier to vietnam north korea angola nicaragua and the communist terrorists in el salvador there is also a confirmed report that the yugoslav government is producing sophisticated minirockets designed exclusively for the use of terrorists and it is as naive to believe that any yugoslav access to new technology is not immediately transferred to the soviet union as it is to believe that ceaucescu does not serve as an immediate conduit for the soviets if all of this were not enough the peoples militia in yugoslavia has responded to protests by everyone from

borne evenly and proportionally by those who benefit from them this resolution gives japan an option if the japanese government feels that it cannot exceed their politically established 1 percent of gross national product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national product on defense last year i must add that i am extremely concerned over the recent export violations by toshiba machine co inc of japan while the united states is spending billions on national security a security that as ive discussed accrues great benefit to the japanese toshiba sold sophisticated propeller manufacturing equipment expressly prohibited by law to the soviet union this sale and unbelievably its accompanying

protector of a nation which at one time struck out in a violent act of hostility against our nation 46 years ago views this sale of ship and submarine quieting technology which occurred twice with particular disdain i am pleased to see the substantive steps taken by the japanese to get to the heart of the toshiba problem and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a

and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to

spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963 trillion in 1986 and had an inflation rate of

from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the

running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules

reservations about this bill h r as the ranking republican on the banking committee let me address one problem in this bill with reepect to bank loans under this bill banks will not be able to reschedule existing loans with south africa because of the debt moratorium that south africa imposed after the first sanctions bill no payments are being made under original loan terms thus united states banks will have no other alternative then to sell the loans because they will become uncollectible under original terms the bottom line impact is that united states banks stand to lose over a billion dollars and our banks loss will become the south african governments gain it is inconceivable to me that the authors of this legislation would want to confer such a windfall on the south african government i should make the point that no new lending has occured since the last sanctions bill the only new money flowing into south africa has been shortterm trade financing which will be prevented under this bill additionally no new investment has been allowed either the first sanctions bill was a positive step forward which banned new banks loans but to allow the south africans to excuse their debt now is in my opinion not a sanction other provisions of the bill are also troublesome for instance unitedstates investors big and small may lose over a billion dollars because of the mandated disinvestment also the breaking of all intelligence ties between our two nations is mandated by this bill despite the strategic location of south africa t enetrage my colleagues to support

recall that the house considered the fair housing legislation on june 22 and june 23 and finally approved the legislation on june 29 subsequently when the housepassed bill went to the other body a series of negotiations ensued to resolve the remaining differences between the civil rights community and the administration our purpose here today is to consider and hopefully accept the changes to h r 1158 adopted by the senate it should be pointed out that these changes have the support of the unitedstates department of housing and urban development the department of justice as well as key elements in the business community principally the national association of realtors and the national association of home builders the amendments adopted in the other body do no harm to the spirit of the balanced compromise approved by this house just a few weeks ago in fact many of these amendments serve to enhance and reinforce some of the provisions contained in that compromise for example many members of this house were concerned about the potential adverse impact that the coverage of families with children could have on senior citizens retirement communities under the language of one notable senate amendment existing senior citizen communities will have increased flexibility and possibility to qualify for the exemption from the familial status requirements just as important is the senateadded language providing a transition period for the current residents of housing that excludes children they will not be required to leave that housing nor will they be subject to eviction that is existing residents whose presence in a community or apartment complex might otherwise cause the community to fall outside the protections in section 807 b 2 will not be counted in calculating whether the exemption should apply the bottom line is that senior citizens retirement communities across the united states will have a greater chance of qualifying for the housing for older persons exemption furthermore no one will be evicted whether in a senior citizens community or an alladult community because of the enactment of this bill litigation authority was also an issue when we considered h r 1158 on this floor approximately 6 weeks ago the language contained in the bill before the house today fully consolidates in the department of justice the authority to represent the federal government in all of the enforcement actions under the fair housing act however while the litigation will be conducted by lawyers from the department of justice the decision as to whether or not prompt judicial action is necessary to obtain injunctive relief or to seek court enforcement of a finding of discriminatirn will still be lodged with the secretary of housing and urban development so under the latest compromise the secretary will decide whether or not litigation should occur where the secretary authorizes the litigation it is transmitted to the attorney general and lie is required to promptly commence and maintain such action consistent with the terms of the senate amendment the amended version of h r 1158 also contains a technical amendment to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies making it clear that certain interim certifications by hud are included in the bill the language adopted in the other body also makes it clear that this legislation is not requiring the establishment of a federal building code because of the accessibility and adaptability requirement for newly constructed multifamlly dwellings these and the other changes made in h r 1158 are improvements and refinements fully consistent with the spirit of the housepassed compromise bill we are in the final stretch run of a circuitous race that began nearly 10 years ago this bipartisan effortto strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1968 law and expand the coverage of the fair housing protections under title viii of the civil rights acthas tested the stamina of many of us in this house my good friend and distinguished colleague from california civil and constitutional rights subcommittee chairman don edwards in particular is to be commended for his patience determination and effective leadership in this effort we are on the threshold of finally passing a federal fair housing law that is workable and effective thirtysix million disabled persons will receive the protections of this fundamental civil rights statute families with children will no longer be arbitrarily limited in their choice of decent housing the secretary of hud will have new and significant powers to investigate discrimination complaints and to enforce the rights guaranteed under this statute if discrimination is found and proven state and local fair housing agencies will contintic their vital integral role in fair housing enforcement all across the united states the states and localities are given an adequate grace period to bring their statutes and ordinances in line with the new federal law so that they can continue to handle a majority of these fair housing complaints complainants and respondents in fair housing discrimination cases are guaranteed due process rights in administrative proceedings and the fundamental right to a trial by jury in a unitedstates district court in instances where they so elect either the adjudication or the trial that results from the election is intended to be a final decision concerning the claims raised by the aggrieved person or any intervenor the aggrieved person or any intervenor may not relitigate the same claims raised in the complaint or seek additional or alternative relief through a direct action in federal court as was reflected in the colloquy between the gentleman from california and myself during consideration of this legislation in june res judicata applies and the intent is that claims based upon the same set of facts should be consolidated into one case before concluding i want to take this one last opportunity to mention some of the individuals who over the years have made positive and prominent contributions to this effort i have already noted and want to reinforce the tremendous contribution made by the gentleman from california the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner deserves special recognition our thanks go to the

as my good friend althea simmons executive director washington office of the naacp kerry scanlon of the washington lawyers committee for civil rights under law wade henderson of the aclu and penda hair of the naacp legal defense fund also brought their usual fairness and balance to this effort the compromise that brought about prompt approval of this legislation in the house of representatives just a few weeks ago could never have occurred without the assistance of these and other representatives of the civil rights community their willingness to compromise was the key this is also an appropriate time to give recognition to many of the unsung heroes which you may not read about in the newspapers but nevertheless have made major contributions to the development of this legislation and its prospects for success from the staff of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights chief counsel catherine leroy associate counsel stuart ishimaru and minority counsel alan slobodin i

has been a subject that has been before the american people in everincreasing awareness for the last several years our trade deficits last year were almost 170 billion this year every indication is that a trade deficit of the united states will be significantly higher than that most of the emphasis of the proposed legislation focuses on the unfair trade practices which have been conducted and are being waged by some of our trading partners against the united states and our businesses i think that we need for a moment before we examine this legislation and get into the debate on the specifics of it to take a broader overview look at the entire question of trade at what some of these terms mean and what we might be doing to ourselves and to our trading partners if we take actions that we may not understand to begin with first of all unfair trade practices trade deficits and competitiveness are terms that are used frequently but they are not wellunderstood and they simply do not necessarily go together and interrelate for example we have had essentially the same or worse unfair trade practices used against us and our products and our services for quite a number of years when we had very large trade surpluses so unfair trade practices in and of themselves do not equate to huge trade deficits in the united states legislation that addresses unfair trade practices alone by no means is going to solve the trade deficit situation in this country i think we need to understand what the primary causes are of trade deficits the trade deficits at least that we have now now there can be other causes in other times but right now there are three primary causes of our trade deficits the first primary cause is the simple fact that the unitedstates economy and the consumer demand of this country over the last several years since 1981 has grown at a significantly greater rate than the growth of the economies and consumer demands of our trading partners the second reason why we have these huge trade deficits is because we have huge domestic budget deficits and we have not been able to do more than contain the growth of those domestic budget deficits we have not been able to reduce the deficits themselves the third primary cause of our trade deficits stems from the ever persistent third world debt and its direct relationship to our ability to trade now let us examine those three primary causes because they need to be understood if we are going to understand the legislation we are about to tackle in the next couple of days what about our growth our economy has grown since 1981 at a pretty rapid rate yes the inflation rates are down still we do not have that high gnp that everybody has been looking for but when you look around the world relative to the economies or the other parts of the world our economy has grown at a significantly more rapid rate than theirs when this occurs several things happen one our consumer demand and our business demand for that matter is up in other words our demand for products and services is greater than theirs and the natural consequence of this demand in a growing economy that is greater than the growth of the other parts of the world is that we are going to import more goods to meet this demand than we export we are going to have to import those goods because our economy has not been producing enough to meet this growth demand so it is only natural that we run a trade deficit in that situation it might not have to be as big as the one we have now but we cannot get around running that kind of a trade deficit until our economy picks up the slack in the system or until the foreign countries that we deal with have their economies pick up we need to have those countries cooperate a little bit with us if we are going to resolve the trade deficits the best way they could cooperate would be to get their own economies growing more rapidly we have encouraged them to do that but so far they have not the most obvious method of doing it particularly among the european allies is to reduce some of their tax burdens so their businesses can expand and their economies flow frankly they have an undue fear of the growth of inflation which is very low now we are almost in deflation in parts of the world we need them to do that but we cannot do it for them we cannot really force them to do that we can cajole them we can urge them we can do all kinds of things but we cannot absolutely get them to do that i suppose they could lower some of their interest rates which are already pretty low a little further they could do a number of things like that but until their demand comes up until they begin to grow at a greater pace than they are now we are going to have a natural pressure that is going to result in our having trade deficits that does not have anything to do with unfair trade practices and does not have anything to do with anything we can legislate about frankly now in the same context of these factors of growth relative growth between our country and our trading partners we have to think about how we finance this growth and how we finance at the same time these huge budget deficits we have with this greater growth relative to the other economies and with these huge deficits on our own side our budget deficits we require relatively higher interest rates than the rest of the world in order to get foreign capital to come over here and finance this for us because we do not have it inherently in our system again that is a natural equation in economics it is very simple it is fairly easily understood by those are involved though the language barriers often get in our way while our interest rates are nowhere near the extraordinarily high interest rates of 7 or 8 years ago when they went right through the ceiling we have had even though we had what we thought were modest rates of april 2 7 1987 congre maybe 7 v2 percent prime and 9 percent for some home mortgages and so on they just a month or so ago those rates are expand still significantly higher than the in not grc terest rates paid around the rest of the our pr world at the present time and have much been for some

yugoslavia seek military cooperation by andrew borowiec it indicated that a united states congressional delegation discussed with top yugoslav defense officials unprecedented military cooperation including the construction of components of united states military hardware in yugoslavia and united states supply of sophisticated military material to enable yugoslavia to modernize its defense forces yugoslav sources explained that they could produce spare parts more cheaply than could united states plants unitedstates assistance to a communist dictatorship would seem selfdefeating but since the allied betrayal of general mihailovich and the forces struggling against the nazi and communist tyrannies in world war ii the united state department has perpetuated the notion that yugoslavia represents communism with a difference in this regard our state department treatment of yugoslav communism is similar to our state department treatment of romania the fiction is preserved that romania too is communism with a difference and despite its horrifying human rights record mostfavorednation treatment is allegedly a way of wooing ceaucescu from the soviet orbit our former ambassador to romania david funderburk in his book pinstripes and reds explodes this myth but not the momentum in the bowels of state that continues to push for such policies the yugoslavs can indeed produce united states military equipment more cheaply than can unitedstates plants workers on the production line at the yugo plant make as little as 25 cents an hour certainly this is a factor behind the anticipated mass strikes in yugoslavia this fall as it should be any american concerned about fair labor standards and unfair trade practices should keep this in mind before considering purchase of a yugo car given this grass exploitation moreover the communist dictators of yugoslavia share another common feature with ceaucescuthey are hopelessly corrupt while ceaucescu sells human beings who want to emigrate the communist officials in yugoslavia who are running state enterprises have fraudulently issued promissory notes to the tune of at least 2 billion for theirown personal h 8288 co

patient kept alive through such unitedstates life support systems as commercial and multinational lending institutions and preferential access to unitedstates markets yugoslavias outstanding world debt is pushing 19 billion their inflation rate is well over 100 percent and their unemployment stands at almost 17 percent small wonder then that yugoslav officials would salivate over the prospect of increased business with the united statesat the expense of united state jobs and security one must keep security in mind when dealing with any communist regime yugoslavia for example has maintained training camps for world terrorists have americans forgotten too that the architect of the achille lauro hijacking abu abbas was rescued and provided sanctuary in yugoslavia by that governments secret police this is the same government that sold minisubs to colonel qadhafi to be used against unitedstates ships in the mediterranean and cbs released on unconfirmed report that yugoslavia has sold sophisticated sea mines to the ayatollah khomeini to be used against american vessels in the persian gulf this is totally consistent behavior by an arms supplier to vietnam north korea angola nicaragua and the communist terrorists in el salvador there is also a confirmed report that the yugoslav government is producing sophisticated minirockets designed exclusively for the use of terrorists and it is as naive to believe that any yugoslav access to new technology is not immediately transferred to the soviet union as it is to believe that ceaucescu does not serve as an immediate conduit for the soviets if all of this were not enough the peoples militia in yugoslavia has responded to protests by everyone from students and intellectuals to workers and minorities with brutal

is clear that the free world must rally together to defend our freedom the independence of our friends and allies and our global markets we call on japan a good friend of the united states to accept our call to bear a fair share of the worlds defense burden the cost of protecting freedom and the free markets should be borne evenly and proportionally by those who benefit from them this resolution gives japan an option if the japanese government feels that it cannot exceed their politically established 1 percent of gross national product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national product on defense last year i must add that i am extremely concerned over the recent export violations by toshiba machine co inc of japan while the united states is spending billions on national security a security that as ive discussed accrues great benefit to the japanese toshiba sold sophisticated propeller manufacturing equipment expressly prohibited by law to the soviet union this sale and unbelievably its accompanying service contract approved by the japanese ministry of international trade and

against our nation 46 years ago views this sale of ship and submarine quieting technology which occurred twice with particular disdain i am pleased to see the substantive steps taken by the japanese to get to the heart of the toshiba problem and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a copy of a recent article by richard perle president reagans former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy regarding the toshiba machine incident h j res 327 joint resolution requiring the president or his designee to enter into negotiations with japan for the purpose of having japan bear a greater share of the free worlds defense burden by either increasing its annual defense expenditures to at least 3 percent of japans gross national product or by obtaining payment by japan to the united states of the difference between 3 percent of japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to protect and augment freedom democracy and capitalism throughout the world the global markets upon which exporting nations depend would not be available whereas the recent developments in the persian gulf bring to light once again the dependence of our allies on the united states for the protection of strategic international sea lanes so vital to the industrialized democracies whereas 37 percent of the oil consumed by the united states 100 percent of the oil consumed by

united states and 60 percent of the oil consumed by japan passes through the gulf of hormuz whereas there have been disturbing revelations that the japanese company toshiba machine has on two occasions sold strategic technological equipment to the soviet union which gives the soviets the ability to reduce the noise level of their submarines by a factor of twenty significantly undermining

its increasing national debt the trade deficit relatively high interest rates and the erosion of united states manufacturing jobs this sale with the approval of the japanese ministry of international

european allies spent an average 3 5 percent of their gnp on defense and japan spent 1 of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963 trillion in 1986 and had an inflation rate of 1 percent and an unemployment rate of 2 8 percent during the same

rather than the serious policy initiative the president intended what congress simply doesnt understand is that no president can defend our interests in this or any other matter if his policies can be snapped around like a rubber band the march so evident in congress and in such executive agencies as the department of commerce to weaken export controls is lumbering forward behind the banner of competitiveness this years slogan masquerading as a policy the fellows who want to keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic red tapea complaint that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige whose department dispenses red tape by the mile echoes happily at industry lunches and in congressional testimony now if mac would put the time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the western alliance the president who has taken the lead in arguing for effective export controls will appear pale and depleted if he

stand by and ignore the continuation of this policy although i have always been a strong proponent of sanctions legislation and fully understand that south africa has made no visible progress in ending apartheid despite passage of previous sanctions legislation i have some serious reservations about this bill h r as the ranking republican on the banking committee let me address one problem in this bill with reepect to bank loans under this bill banks will not be able to reschedule existing loans with south africa because of the debt moratorium that south africa imposed after the first sanctions bill no payments are being made under original loan terms thus united states banks will have no other alternative then to sell the loans because they will become uncollectible under original terms the bottom line impact is that united states banks stand to lose over a billion dollars and our banks loss will become the south african governments gain it is inconceivable to me that the authors of this legislation would want to confer such a windfall on the south african government i should make the point that no new lending has occured since the last sanctions bill the only new money flowing into south africa has been shortterm trade financing which will be prevented under this bill additionally no new investment has been allowed either the first sanctions bill was a positive step forward which banned new banks loans but to allow the south africans to excuse their debt now is in my opinion not a sanction other provisions of the bill are also troublesome for instance unitedstates investors big and small may lose over a billion dollars because of the mandated disinvestment also the breaking of all intelligence ties between our two nations is mandated by this bill despite the strategic location of south africa t enetrage my colleagues to support tht 1roomfield alternative as a more sensiole in their approach to this problem we should seek allied strength if these sanctions are to be effective as the broomfield alternative suggests moreover thl burton substitute would specifically attempt to improve black economic power in south africa while maintaining the existing sanctions both of these objectives are laudableand notably lacking in h r 1580 h r 1580 in its present form is a solo effort because we do not have indications that other nations plan to follow our lead in the sanctions effort will blacks have more economic power if we pass this bill most likely notand therefore their leverage for change will diminish in the final analysis what we are doing here is simply sending a signal that we will have nothing to do with south africa it is a symbolic move and i can understand that approach but with respect to real economic harm to the south african government and economy i really dont believe that there will be any significant impact from the sanctions contained in h r 1580 as i mentioned i have supported sanctions in the past on every occasion i favor more punitive action against south africa but i believe that this legislation needs to be improved as it stands unitedstates banks and investors will be injured with no corresponding benefit or gain to the black majority in south africa moreover this legislation will provide a significant financial windfall for the south african government and i fall to understand
