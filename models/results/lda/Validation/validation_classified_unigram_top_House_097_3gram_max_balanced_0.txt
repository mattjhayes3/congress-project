solutions of the problems confronting this nation and the world by their votes the people of this nation indicated they wanted a change in direction and this president offered a change he promised to try and reduce federal spending he promised to try to cut the destructive high inflation rate he promised to reduce the unwarranted and unnecessary federal interference in our daily lives with the help in some cases reluctant help of the 535 members of congress this president has made a new beginning he was not able to reduce federal spending but he did cut my more than half the request for increased federal spending he was not able to eliminate all the unnecessary redtape but he was able to reduce the number of pages of regulations printed in the federal register from 73 000 to 51 000 he was not able to end inflation but he did cut the rate which had been in double digit figures for most of the previous administration down to an annualized rate in the month of march of less than 4 percent for the past 5 or 6 months we have been provided with a consistent diet of bad news the morning newspaper headlines and the evening television news emphasize what they perceive to be wrong with the presidents program and ignore what many common folk perceive to be right with the presidents program nowhere has this consistent criticism of the reagan administration been more pernicious than it has been in the reports of central and latin america and particularly the reports from el salvador now i call your attention to some good news and to underscore the importance of this good news permit me to review in some detail what has been going on in el salvador mr speaker in land area this nation is about the size of your own state of massachusetts it is bordered by guatemala on the north honduras on the east and nicaragua on the southeast with about 135 miles of frontage on the pacific ocean about 5 million people live in el salvador el salvador became independent of spain in 1821 and of the central american federation in 1841 about 10 percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and

checks and we have not backed them up with the funds president reagan was elected to suggest that we ought to change that practice that we ought to actually cut here instead of promising everything to everybody as some wellintentioned individuals in our society do and then attempting to buy things that we cannot afford the question before us is which of these proposals better does that job to make us refrain from what we have done in the past and to begin anew this morning i picked up the washington post and i think it was very simply put by a writer she said that the proposal from the committee would stop writing checks for a year president reagan and his allies would throw away the checkbook entirely and that is really what we are talking about the grammlatta proposal suggests some fundamental changes in spending in this house to commit us not only for this year but for several years beyond if we are really going to get the confidence of the american people we have to show that this is not going to be a 1yer marvel we have to show that we are committed to making some fundamental changes some have stood here on this floor and said do not vote for granimlatta because it suggests that you will be making some fundamental changes well i would echo some of those remarks but i would rephrase it vote for it because it makes some fundamental changes the results of november 4 did not tell us to merely slow up the hemorrhaging that is taking place in terms of our spending in the federal government or to merely slow up as we pile deficit upon deficit upon deficit the people told us to turn this country around and to go in a new direction so that when we do make promises to those people who are needy in this country we make sure we can fulfill those promises and we can back them up with money now why is that important it is important because every time we kite a chieck in the federal government what we do is we weaken the amount of money that is in the pocket of every american citizen and who do we especially weaken we especially weaken those people on fixed incomes particularly the elderly in this country because when we depress the value of the dollar they have in their pockets they can buy far far less than they could before and we may feel good about saying we in government will bail you out but we never bail them out entirely and in the entire

believes what he says fire him because in my judgment there is a direct relationship between deficits and inflation indeed i want to quote a short statement by beryl sprinkel under secretary of the treasury for monetary affairs who said as follows a policy of monetizing the debt designed to alleviate upward pressures or rises in interest rates ignores the fact that increased money growth must accompany federal reserve purchases of government debt such money growth generates inflation and inflationary expectations the reagan administration recognizes the connection among monetization of the deficit money growth and inflation i think in 1979 the nation had a very marked change in policy when the federal reserve board changed its method of dealing with the management of the nations money supply from one of attempting to adjust interest rates to one of controlling money growth as a result of that change in policy we have seen a marked decline in inflation since 1979 the figures on 1981 are around an annualized rate of say 8 percent i believe the figure for 1982 will be close to 6 percent but what does that cost we are moving down on inflation but we have exacerbated our problem because we have continued federal spending at an everincreasing rate and as a result the federal demand for credit is today absolutely awesome the figures that i have seen here indicate that in 1981 the federal demand of credit direct indirect and guaranteed loans totaled 78 8 percent of available credit in our money system of the nation that is an increase of 30 percentage points what is the answer i think that we in this congress could balance the budget of this country in 60 days by reducing spending not increasing taxes or as the gentleman in the well suggests he i think would prefer to increase some taxes perhaps my response would be to decrease spending but perhaps the combination of the two could achieve the result we all hope and work for namely balancing the budget by reducing the federal demand for credit as the gentleman from michigan pointed out a few minutes ago if we would do this we would see a marked decline in the interest rate the prime rate the banks set for all of us government and private sources combined of 4 to 6 points i think the gentleman said he did not say the period of time but what i have heard within 90 days we could experience a decline in the prime rate of up to 6 points if we would balance the budget what would that do that would make first trust deed money of 10 or 11 percent available people could buy cars at an interest rate of

primary goal without a healthy economy other issues have little inportance i am urging president reagan to freeze spending levels at the approved fiscal year 1982 spending level for all programs until this budget is balanced this simple approach could be taken when president reagan submits an amended fiscal 1983 budget later this year high interest rates impact all americans and no relief is in sight as long as the federal government continues to increase its portion of the available credit an unstable monetary market has devastated my home state of oregon where we are dependent upon timberrelated industries even though i commend president reagan for his efforts i believe we are moving at a snails pace toward a balanced budget the northwest will not survive a slow economic recovery the answer it appears to me that is most politically and economically sound and quick is to freeze spending hold all programs including entitlements at the fiscal year 1982 spending level and we could achieve a balanced budget by 1984 if you look back you will find that we could have had an 8 9 billion surplus in fiscal year 1983 if spending had been leveled at the fiscal year 1981 figures what could be more fair than asking everyone to accept the same amount this year and nextand even longer if necessaryto get this job done we have the support of americans and lack only congressional courage i urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to make the difference between learning to live with deficits and meeting the challenge to do away with them this was a principle issue during my campaign and i will do everything possible to balance the federal budget and bring interest rates down to affordable levels the americans who sent me here expect nothing less what about your americans

informed and heartfelt debate not only in this chamber but also across the united states after careful reflection i felt i had to support the addabbo amend ment to delete funds for procurement of the mx missile it has been pointed out that the ap propriations bill contained funds only for purchase of five missiles and would not have committed us to the dense pack basing moreover funds could not have been spent until march 15 1983 allowing additional deliberations about basing i have great con cerns however about the burden we would have had to undertake had the addabbo amendment failed the bill would have committed us to purchase of missiles and by necessity the requirement to install eventually the missiles in some form of basing mode i remain unconvinced of the viability of dense pack and have questions as to whether an alternative presently exists which can meet the survivability standards that any new landbased missile will have to attain i was not willing to make a commitment to a program when i could not know its eventual design or cost especially when the cost will most certainly range in the tens of billions of dollars it would have been like voting for a water project before the engineering studies had been done i do not however support the amendment to delete research and development funds for an mx missile i am committed as i am convinced the president is as well to sharp reductions in the worlds stock of nuclear arms as the united states continues to press forward in the start talks with the soviet union i believe it would be unwise to cease all r d work on the mx i believe that continued mx research and development is a signal of our resolve and hope that continuing diligent start negotiations will be swift and successful because of the decision made yesterday to halt production on the mx however i find myself a reluctant opponent of the amendment to eliminate the b1b strategic bomber program i do not believe that we can eliminate both the mx and the b1 bomber the obsolescence of our b52s as a penetrating bomber even considering the standoff potential offered by longrange airlaunched cruise missiles makes a replacement bomber inevitable in addition because of the radically lower radar profile of the new blb i believe the bi is functionally very similar to any aircraft we might see in the next decade embodying stealth technology although an amendment may be offerred today which would suspend deployment of pershing ii missiles in europe pending resolution of technical concerns i believe the appropriations committees deletion of pershing ii funds for the same reasons makes the question moot the committee has decided that the pershing ii is not now technically successful and not be deployed however soviet ss20 missiles have by all accounts dramatically altered the balance of power in europe i believe deployment of unitedstates tactical nuclear weapons in those european nations that want them is necessary the pershing ii is intended to replace the pershing i a missile that has a shorter range but is also less precise less flexible and carries a larger warhead the pershing ii i believe is much better suited to stopping or deterring a warsaw pact armored invasion the role for which it is intended i also believe that the pershing il is a less dangerous weapon since it has better accuracy and smaller warhead means than the pershing i i also support the amendment that would delete funding of one of two nuclear aircraft carriers at a savings of approximately 3 6 billion i am unconvinced of the strategic necessity of carrier task forces and am concerned that they would be easy targets to a potential enemy most of all i am opposed to the expenditure which an additional carrier would require plus the funds that would be necessary for the accompanying task force expecially when the difference is between 14 and 15 carrier task forces finally i wanted to support the roukema amendment which would have deleted 3 7 billion in budget authority for procurement in fiscal year 1083 this bill would have limited total defense spending to 5 percent in real growth between fiscal year 1982 and 1983 in my position on the budget committee i have supported efforts in the past to reduce all spending across the board i intend to continue to do my best to insure that defense spending is adequate but restrained i do not step back from our national commitment to an adequate defense and deterrence of aggression against ourselves or our allies nonetheless setting priorities is the essential business of democratic government our expenditures for defense except those which are essential and urgent must compete with other priorities and the vital need to reduce the federal deficit i believe the roukema amendment represents sound fiscal policy and balancing of defense priorities and deserved our support because earlier amendments had almost achieved the 5percent cut embodied in the roukema amendmeht it was

the unwarranted and unnecessary federal interference in our daily lives with the help in some cases reluctant help of the 535 members of congress this president has made a new beginning he was not able to reduce federal spending but he did cut my more than half the request for increased federal spending he was not able to eliminate all the unnecessary redtape but he was able to reduce the number of pages of regulations printed in the federal register from 73 000 to 51 000 he was not able to end inflation but he did cut the rate which had been in double digit figures for most of the previous administration down to an annualized rate in the month of march of less than 4 percent for the past 5 or 6 months we have been provided with a consistent diet of bad news the morning newspaper headlines and the evening television news emphasize what they perceive to be wrong with the presidents program and ignore what many common folk perceive to be right with the presidents program nowhere has this consistent criticism of the reagan administration been more pernicious than it has been in the reports of central and latin america and particularly the reports from el salvador now i call your attention to some good news and to underscore the importance of this good news permit me to review in some detail what has been going on in el salvador mr speaker in land area this nation is about the size of your own state of massachusetts it is bordered by guatemala on the north honduras on the east and nicaragua on the southeast with about 135 miles of frontage on the pacific ocean about 5 million people live in el salvador el salvador became independent of spain in 1821 and of the central american federation in 1841 about 10 percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and different attitude toward the role of the federal government in our everyday lives is a remarkable change we spent billions to create the great society and are we better off for all that public money spent the crime rate in evcry category is up we spent billions of public money in the

the elderly in this country because when we depress the value of the dollar they have in their pockets they can buy far far less than they could before and we may feel good about saying we in
