regulated under the ocean dumping act the oda allows dumping of radioactive waste only after congress has passed a joint resolution authorizing the dumping although this provision has been in force

hundreds of thousands of gallon of liquid radioactive waste it also learned that solid nuclear fuel waste totaling 10 million curies is currently stored aboard vessels in murmansk harbor even after

bill that then raises the question why did they support the last bill i think the answer to that is they did not believe that the last bill could be improved that the effort would be made to do so however we demonstrated in the house of representatives a week ago that it could be improved by the vote that we took to send the bill back to conference i believe we have a better bill today than we had a week ago i want to sincerely congratulate both the republicans and the democrats who worked on the bill nevertheless if we can improve it after two allnight sessions i believe it can still be improved more if we take some more time for that reason i oppose the conference report that is on the floor today that does not mean i oppose a crime bill of course but i believe that we have demonstrated those of us who voted to send the bill back to the committee that it can be improved that it was improved and i believe it will be still further improved if we work on it further however the question arises what about the need to fight crime right now i believe that that need is met by supporting what will be introduced by the gentleman from florida as a motion to recommit the bipartisan hunterbrewster bill this will provide funding to police and to prisons and to the border patrol immediately and those are the areas that time after time after time are so often publicly mentioned as in need of that kind of support the criticism of that alternative is it does not include everything there are many members who want to see much more enacted to assist law enforcement and i agree with that as a former career prosecutor i believe efforts against career criminals are an extremely important tool for law enforcement i support the strongest threestrikesandyouareout provision we can write and in some violent crime cases two strikes in conclusion i think that alternative will get the most funding going where it is needed immediately while we work on the rest of

gentleman from illinois to completely abolish the funding i am going to explain again today why i support the crane amendment i have no quarrel with all the good things that the distinguished gentleman from illinois said about nea funding but we ought to have a ground rule around here the rule should say that we will not fund with mainstream american taxpayer money socalled works of art that cannot be discussed in this chamber where children visiting with their taxpaying parents are in the gallery i cannot in good conscience describe some of the vile nihilism at the whitney museum of american art in the city of my birth the once beautiful new york city if we cannot discuss it on the floor of congress how can we possibly fund this garbage the nea used to with every dollar fund legitimate artists and worthy thespians now it funds pornography and sodomy it may only be a tiny percentage but as i told the gentleman from illinois last year this 175 million feeds the nihilistic cancer eating away at our country how can any of my colleagues at a townhall meeting defend the following i will try and figure out some way to get through this without offending the youngest child in the gallery i will do the same hosting the rush limbaugh show on monday tuesday and wednesday of next week this show reaches 20 million people 20 times more than are watching the proceedings of this chamber the whitney museum of american art in new york city received general operating funds from the nea to the tune of 200 000 over the last 2 years thus every whitney exhibit has indirect nea support this is fact now whitney currently has two exhibits one is called abject art it is designed to be foul and vile and repugnant it says in the brochures you will find this repugnant and if you do i guess then youre an art aficionado the other exhibit is called the subject of rape now here comes my painful exercise in trying to describe vaguely an exhibit indirectly funded by the nea without offending any americans abject art and this is from their brochure describes a body of work which incorporates or suggests abject materials such as dirt hair excrement dead animals menstrual blood and rotting food further quoting from their brochure employing methodologies adapted from feminism queer theory poststructuraism marxism and psychoanalysis i cannot read the next line that my staffers including female staffers wrote for me in this exhibit a young woman is shown going no 1 in the toilet i as my colleagues know softened that a little bit there is also a 3foot mound of doodoo i softened that a little bit there is a dismembered sculpture of two women havingi cannot read that at all then there are framed samples of baby fecal stains since i have just welcomed my ninth grandchild into the world i know what fecal stains look like drying them and framing them i do not understand why american taxpayers have to fund that garbage then there is a film by two american homosexual men titled skull followed by the fword in this piece one man is shown shoving his head intoi cannot read this let us say he puts it into the other mans body i did not know one could do that

their history than to let them hear the music read the literature and see the films of the twenties forties sixties et cetera art not only serves as a form of entertainment it tells the american story we are all quite aware of the fiscal problems that continue to plague our economy unfortunately the arts like all segments of our society must share in americas fiscal sacrifice like many of my colleagues i do not support the nea authorization bill before us it simply does not cut enough at a time when we cannot find the means to properly care for the elderly and provide homes for the homeless while still attempting to eliminate our huge budget deficit i cannot support the funding levels in this bill we must prioritize spending and make difficult choices we just cannot afford this level of nea spending i oppose the crane amendment abolishing the nea totally i fear that if we eliminate funding for the nea this year we will never be able to resurrect it this would be an injustice not only to todays americans but to the next generation of young americans who will not experience the many works of art we now enjoy local symphonies and plays are some examples of the art the nea provides i encourage presentations of beethoven bach and other contemporaries like gershwin our children could be deprived of the full value of these works if we eliminate funding for the nea that is why i oppose the bill as it stands before us so that we may bring it back to the floor in a form that will permit the funding of morally responsible worthwhile and entertaining works of art while

allow states to provide additional protection for marine mammals which reside in state waters by so amending the marine mammal protection act we could close a loophole that actually hinders or removes protection for marine mammals in some instances i believe that it is an unfortunate irony that under the current rules of the mmpa states are denied the ability to safeguard specific populations of mammals in certain carefully designated waters of their own in my state of florida there are laws on the books which would prohibit the capture of marine mammals in areas known as aquatic preserves which are specifically defined by statute and have clearly defined borders these areas have been set aside because the duly elected government of florida has publicly and in the sunshine decided that the preservation of the natural resources within these boundaries is vital to the public interest many public hearings have occurred but the marine mammal protection act unfortunately and i believe
