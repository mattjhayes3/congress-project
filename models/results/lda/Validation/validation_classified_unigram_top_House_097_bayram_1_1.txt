to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by

that if this section remains in the bill in the other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the military knowing they are going to leave at a certain time most of them are preparing for that date as a

slowpay problem has become far more than an irritant it has become an extremely heavy burden and a reason to stop doing business with the government since 90 percent of everyday government purchases

small concerns into bankruptcy in every case where a small business is concerned however the governments slowness places an extreme hardship on the business small business counts on payments from its contracts to meet its obligations due to a generally tight cash flow and narrow profit margins there is little flexibility to meet the problems engendered when the government falls to meet its obligations in a timely manner companies have had to borrow money at high interest rates in order to meet operating expenses there is certainly little sense of fairness in this type of situation the prompt payment act before us today addresses this very serious problem since the federal bureaucracy failed to make the necessary changes when this problem was brought to light several years ago this

resources which were once abundant were overfished and on the brink of economic collapse when the 200mile act was passed the major part of the blame for this resource disaster must be laid at the feet of foreign fishing fleets which operated with little or no regard for the resource these same fleets which are now regulated by the fcma bear some responsibility to the unitedstates industry for the economic damage inflicted by overfishing the fees paid by these foreign fishermen should be used to provide developmental assistance for the unitedstates industry so that our fishermen can fully recover and resume their preeminent role as the harvesters and processors of the resources found in our 200mile zone h r 5662 continues the fisheries loan fund which is the repository of foreign fishing fees currently the act authorizes the use of these moneys to assist unitedstates fishermen who because of current economic conditions and competition with subsidized foreign fish imports are experiencing significant economic difficulties moneys which were already available in the fisheries loan fund and which were used to assist vessel owners with federally guaranteed loans not only permitted these fishermen to continue their operations and to recover economically but also to avoid defaulting on approximately 21 1 million in governmentguaranteed loans this type of shortterm assistance benefits the government as well as the fishermen and the u s economy it is clear however that foreign fishing fees can be used for many other purposes the subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment is planning to investigate alternative uses for these funds i believe that these moneys can clearly be used to benefit the unitedstates industry for example part of the funds could be used to provide grants similar to saltonstallkennedy act grants for industry development the money could also be used to provide capital for a federal loan guarantee program to assist the processing industry or to assist higher risk ventures which are not now eligible to participate in the vessel obligation guarantee program these and other ideas are worth exploring and represent the types of projects which will benefit the unitedstates industry and for which foreign fishing fees should be used to preserve the fisheries loan fund through which these foreign fishing fees are and will be channeled i urge the adoption of h r 5662 i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from washington"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "when the congress enacted the bilingual ballots provision of tho

"3 years ago this legislative body took a positive step to encourage savings and investment by reducing the maximum federal tax rates on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by cosponsoring the

that if this section remains in the bill in the other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them
