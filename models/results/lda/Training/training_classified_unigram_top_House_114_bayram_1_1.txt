deadlines instead of enabling our teachers to do what they love and inspiring our children to learn and succeed they are forced to waste classroom time by preparing and administering redundant and often lowquality tests it has been nearly 15 weeks since i last spoke on the house floor about the need to provide relief from burdensome testing requirements for our teachers students and parents at the time the house was actively considering h r 5 legislation to reauthorize the elementary and secondary education act as well as an amendment i was pleased to offer with my democratic colleague suzanne bonamici of oregon our bipartisan amendment which was adopted and included as part of h r 5 offers a solution to the overtesting problem that is taxing our schools and teachers our amendment empowers teachers and parents by giving existing federal funding to state and local education agencies to develop curriculum plans to make better use of tests for the students with the ability to reduce testing it would also allow for quicker delivery of assessment data to educators and parents and a more qualitative analysis of how to shape curriculum for that student from the local school district and parent not the federal government we need to continue our work on this bill and reauthorize the esea we owe it to our colleagues who have worked for months on this bill and underlying policy we owe it to our teachers who have dedicated their livelihood and careers to the betterment of our children most of all we owe it to our children who deserve the best possible education that we can provide an education that encourages them to think learn and succeed and not that simply tells them how to fill in the blanks on a generic test for those of my colleagues who may be undecided on advancing this bill and reauthorizing the esea i ask you to consider are you happy with the status quo are you content to sit on the sidelines while common core standards and a myriad of tests are

of congress but rather as a taxpayer in the west chester area school district i read this because there is no better example of a need and an opportunity for us to help our families back home do our job and govern here in congress it reads dear parents many of us are quick to fault the unitedstates public education system comparing it to other smaller european countries and finding deficits and gaps the system and the way it is funded are far from perfect however we manage to educate generations of children who go on to do incredible things now we are asking our students to do something that is entirely unfair to spend weeks and weeks filling in bubbles taking standardized tests and having their entire educational ambition directed toward passing them this is not what public education was intended to do nor should do as the superintendent of the west chester area school district i believe in very high standards for our students i believe in accountability i do believe that tests can be a good thing but not the way we are being forced by the government to give them we officially began the pssa testing window on april 13 and we will continue to test through may 27 when we finish with the high school keystone exams a new graduation requirement beginning with the class of 2017 even a straighta student who doesnt do well on these tests wont receive a diploma under state law state and federally mandated testing has been around for a long time and is certainly here to stay but it has become a massive burden that is stifling creativity and love of teaching and learning while our district has embraced high standards and accountability we now spend the first 7 months of the school year preparing to take three standardized tests then we spend approximately 6 weeks giving tests to students unlike private and parochial schools public schools are mandated to use these tests to determine graduation for students and for teacher and administrator evaluations it is positively stressing usand our system to the max our teachers students and parents all say the extreme amount of time focused on testing is causing ridiculous amounts of stress in the classroom faculty room and at home the angst is palpable as you walk through our hallways where is there time for creativity in teaching where is there time for exploration and collaboration our talented staff do their very best to find ways to incorporate what needs to be tested into their dynamic lesson plans but it is difficult given the time constraints and enormous amount of material being covered ultimately that negativity is going to drive down our test scores learning should be challenging but also enjoyable and exciting teaching should be dynamic and creative we are missing that because of these tests i am not advocating a system without any testing rigor or accountability but what we are doing right now isnt working teachers have literally sent me hundreds of examples of how students are worried anxious and depressed the rules for taking these exams are crazy as well springtime in a school should be full of excitement and learningnot anymore the last 3 weeks our schools have looked more like

means to save for retirement by imposing new and needlessly burdensome standards on financial experts who provide investment advice to americans the fiduciary rule will price many retirees out of the market causing a guidance gap which will lead to americans saving less money or worse not saving at all we cant allow this burdensome rule to wreak havoc on the financial future of american citizens i

member of the united states house of representatives i remember feeling so excited about the opportunity that lay ahead i remember vividly this chamber and all that it meant to me and to the country the men and women debating the big issues of the day not always agreeing but always fighting without apology for what they believe in over the past 6 years i have come to understand that this institution is far bigger than any one person and that freedom itself is even more important than this institution some of the worlds greatest debates have occurred right here in this chamber for what happens here affects more than just the people of my district or even my country over those 6 years i have done my best to contribute constructively to the process and to serve the people of my district and my country my guiding principle has always been rooted in the belief that washington should only do what people cannot do for themselves i fought and opposed the billiondollar surplus bill the government takeover of our health care and the massive new regulations put on small businesses but more importantly i fought for the people of my district so that their voice would be heard and respected by my colleagues for i heard that voice in every vote that i have cast but i also knew that being in the majority was key to making a difference so i am proud of the work i have done to contribute to a republican majority here in congressto begin to scale back the overreaches of a bloated federal government and to begin to bend the curve on outofcontrol spending that has only happened because of a republican majority and i am proud to have played a role in building it during this time i saw how slow the federal government can be and how frustrating congress can get but i also learned that one man can make a difference working with my republican colleagues and across the aisle with my democrat friends we have been able to pass legislation that helped businesses across america create millions of jobs some of them have been located in my home district but many more across this great country there was is and will be so much to do and i am honored to have played a small part in making a real difference but these accomplishments come with some frustrations as well that this body doesnt move quickly enough or as efficiently as it could to confront the challenges facing our country i regret that i wont be here when we finally pass a smarter simpler tax code so that every hardworking taxpayer in my district and across the country will know that washington not only cares about them but respects them and their sacrifice and i will miss joining my colleagues in saving and strengthening social security and medicare that will directly improve the quality of life for millions of americans for generations to come to my constituents back home the good hardworking taxpayers whom i have been lucky enough to call friends i will never be able to thank you enough for the opportunity you have given me to serve together we have tackled some of the big problems at home like economic development projects helping businesses expand improving our locks and dams along our riverways and so much more projects that have helped improve the quality of life in our community we have also tackled some small problems but big problems to the people who have been facing themfolks looking for help adopting children overseas or simply trying to get answers from an unresponsive bureaucracy here in d c solving those individual cases has been extremely fulfilling i am particularly grateful to have played a role in helping so many veterans get the respect they deserve and the benefits that they earned i am proud of the good work that my team has delivered to the tens of thousands of constituents who have turned to our office in their time in need my staff delivered for me because they delivered for you every day 24 7 i was never more excited than the day i walked into this chamber 6 years ago i leave here with sadness and humility for those whom i have let down i will work tirelessly to make it up to you i know that god has a plan for my life the good book tells us that before i formed you in the womb i knew you i also know that every person faces adversity in life abraham lincoln held this seat in congress for one term but few faced as many defeats in his personal business and public life as he did his continual perseverance in the face of these trials never giving up is something all of us americans should be inspired by especially when going through a valley in life i believe that through lifes struggles we learn from our mistakes and we learn more about ourselves and i know that this is not the end of a story but rather the beginning of a new chapter thank you for the honor to serve i look forward to keeping in touch with my friends in this chamber and my friends across the 18th district may god continue to bless this

to el paso i would like to thank the gentlewoman for the time today and also for taking me to your district and seeing that part of the border our trip a few weeks ago was great enlightening to me i have spent a lot of time crisscrossing those 820 miles of the border and it was great to see how the san diego sector and tucson and my fellow texans in mcallen are doing the same thing as the gentlewoman knows i spent 9 years as an undercover officer in the cia i chased groups like al qaeda and the taliban i have chased narcotraffickers all over the world and the threat is increasing and the threat is sophisticated the drug trafficking organizations in mexico are making 50 billion a year in the united states that is a big number their tactics techniques and procedures are sophisticated and we need to keep up it is about moves and countermoves what i like about this bill is it empowers our members of border patrol to do their job a lot of people talk about border security i like to refine it a little bit part of it is interdiction stopping people before they get to the border it is grabbing them it is having them in custody and then it is removal this bill is focused on this first piece of border security which is interdiction we need to make sure that our men and women that are on the border every single day have the tools that they need in order to do their job it is different in tucson it is different in eagle pass it is different in san diego what i like about this bill that was developed under the leadership of chairman mccaul is that it gives them that freedom and flexibility having spent a lot of time overseas i know the disconnect between the field and headquarters and that is going on right here on our border we need to make sure that the guys and gals that are on the border have the tools that they need this is a sophisticated threat as you alluded to using ultralight aircraft to deliver their payload they are using tactics that intelligence organizations have used all across the world to do denial and deception we need to make sure we have all the resourcesthings like the aerostats things like radar technology things like uavsin order to have that combined picture of the border this is something that for 19 months i talked to folks in the district i know like you this was a very important issue the american people sent us up here to do our job and our job is to protect our citizens and to protect our homeland this bill does it it is a strong bill and i look forward to working over these next few days and weeks in

impossible h r 50 allows committee chairmen and ranking members to ask for the retrospective reviews of specific regulations i think there needs to be a degree of deference and some respect for the idea that it is for committee chairmen and ranking members both sides of the aisle not just based on some whim i think it is offensive to suggest that it be just some whimsical thing this allows an important check on any preimplementation costbenefit analysis and these retrospective reviews better clarify the true costs of regulation even president obama supports retrospective reviews and issued an executive order requiring agencies to conduct them more importantly retrospective reviews work in april of 2014 the gao issued a report on retrospective reviews at 22 executive agencies that report found that more than 90 percent of retrospective regulation reviews led the agencies to revise clarify or eliminate regulation text90 percent however the pace of retrospective review is much slower than planned and the 22 agencies reviewed by the gao had plans to conduct more than 650 retrospective reviews but had only completed 246 of them as of august of as you can see the agencies are already doing this work it is good to go back and review we shouldnt be afraid of that we should encourage it this provision in the bill simply allows congress to work with agencies to prioritize regulatory

days as a pow and attempted to escape three times at great risk his captors executed him on june 25 1965 only 24 years old sergeant bennett was the first american pow killed in vietnam and like so

packing up their lockers taking final exams and saying goodbye to their classmates and homeroom desks for the summer while our students head into a welldeserved summer recess our teachers have already started thinking ahead to the next academic year setting up lesson plans and figuring out what their course curriculums will be unfortunately many of our teachers will be faced with yet another year of stifling one size fitsall testing requirements and deadlines instead of enabling our teachers to do what they love and inspiring our children to learn and succeed they are forced to waste classroom time by preparing and administering redundant and often lowquality tests it has been nearly 15 weeks since i last spoke on the house floor about the need to provide relief from burdensome testing requirements for our teachers students and parents at the time the house was actively considering h r 5 legislation to reauthorize the elementary and secondary education act as well as an amendment i was pleased to offer with my democratic colleague suzanne bonamici of oregon our bipartisan amendment which was adopted and included as part of h r 5 offers a solution to the overtesting problem that is taxing our schools and teachers our amendment empowers teachers and parents by giving existing federal funding to state and local education agencies to develop curriculum plans to make better use of tests for the students with the ability to reduce testing it would also allow for quicker delivery of assessment data to educators and parents and a more qualitative analysis of how to shape curriculum for that student from the local school district and parent not the federal government we need to continue our work on this bill and reauthorize the esea we owe it to our colleagues who have worked for months on this bill and underlying policy we owe it to our teachers who have dedicated their livelihood and careers to the betterment of our children most of all we owe it to our children who deserve the best possible education that we can provide an education that encourages them to think learn and succeed and not that simply tells them how to fill in the blanks on a generic test for those of my colleagues who may be undecided on advancing this bill and reauthorizing the esea i ask you to consider are you happy with the status quo are you content to sit on the sidelines while common core standards and a myriad of tests are imposed on our students i would like to read into the record a letter i received from the superintendent of my home school district let me preface this by saying it was not written to me as a member of congress but rather as a taxpayer in the west chester area school district i read this because there is no better example of a need and an opportunity for us to help our families back home do our job and govern here in congress it reads dear parents many of us are quick to fault the unitedstates public education system comparing it to other smaller european countries and finding deficits and gaps the system and the way it is funded are far from perfect however we manage to educate generations of children who go on to do incredible things now we are asking our students to do something that is entirely unfair to spend weeks and weeks filling in bubbles taking standardized tests and having their entire educational ambition directed toward passing them this is not what public education was intended to do nor should do as the superintendent of the west chester area school district i believe in very high standards for our students i believe in accountability i do believe that tests can be a good thing but not the way we are being forced by the government to give them we officially began the pssa testing window on april 13 and we will continue to test through may 27 when we finish with the high school keystone exams a new graduation requirement beginning with the class of 2017 even a straighta student who doesnt do well on these tests wont receive a diploma under state law state and federally mandated testing has been around for a long time and is certainly here to stay but it has become a massive burden that is stifling creativity and love of teaching and learning while our district has embraced high standards and accountability we now spend the first 7 months of the school year preparing to take three standardized tests then we spend approximately 6 weeks giving tests to students unlike private and parochial schools public schools are mandated to use these tests to determine graduation for students and for teacher and administrator evaluations it is positively stressing usand our system to the max our teachers students and parents all say the extreme amount of time focused on testing is causing ridiculous amounts of stress in the classroom faculty room and at home the angst is palpable as you walk through our hallways where is there time for creativity in teaching where is there time for exploration and collaboration our talented staff do their very best to find ways to incorporate what needs to be tested into their dynamic lesson plans but it is difficult given the time constraints and enormous amount of material being covered ultimately that negativity is going to drive down our test scores learning should be challenging but also enjoyable and exciting teaching should be dynamic and creative we are missing that because of these tests i am not advocating a system without any testing rigor or accountability but what we are doing right now isnt working teachers have literally sent me hundreds of examples of how students are worried anxious and depressed the rules for taking these exams are crazy as well springtime in a school should be full of excitement and learningnot anymore the last 3 weeks our schools have looked more like prisons than educational institutions the rules allow students to take as much time as they need but once they close the booklet the session is over and they cant return to it lets reauthorize the esea lets reduce the federal footprint over public education it is the right thing to do"]]}
