criticize their government openly and to make their voices heard i talked about student protests that have been met with resistance by the puerto rico police i talked about closed meetings of the legislature and about the efforts to silence and destroy the local bar association i was not the first to speak about it and i could have said much more this report entitled human rights crisis in puerto rico first amendment under siege is searing it details the complaints of students legislators the press and the general public who were beaten and peppersprayed by police female students who were treated with gross disrespect and the governments overreaction to demonstrations at the university and at the capitol over budget cuts and layoffs this next picture this is the capitol in san juan puerto rico surrounded by riot police as people attempted to gain entrance to the same assembly as this one here today and this is how they were met by the police this is how the police dealt with protesters the images of police tactics and behavior in these photos explain why our department of justice is investigating the puerto rican police for excessive force and unconstitutional searches as we speak today how could you see these images and not speak out i was hardly the first to speak out about these matters and i probably wont be the last here it is the daily sun in puerto rico sticks versus speech as a member of congress it is more than my right it is my obligation to speak out when fundamental freedoms are attacked and what was the response to my free speech defending the right of the puerto rican people to be heard it was to challenge my right to be heard here in the halls of congress the resident commissioner of puerto rico said in this very body that he is the only one authorized to speak about puerto rico at any time this week the puerto rican legislature debated a resolution of censureyes censurecondemning me for speaking out against these very abuses a leading member of the ruling party even said gutierrez wasnt born in puerto rico his kids werent born in puerto rico gutierrez doesnt plan to die and be buried in puerto rico so gutierrez doesnt have the right to speak about puerto rico well let me tell you something if you see injustice anywhere it is not only your right but your duty to speak about it we dont speak about injustice or apartheid or human rights abuses or the denial of rights of women in places around the world because we ourselves were born there that would be silly where we see injustice we speak out because it is the right thing to do ironically by questioning my right to speak out on behalf of free speech they have made my point crystal clear by challenging my free speech they have amplified the words of my 5minute speech more than if i had spoken for 5 hours and it is their right my critics have the right of free speech even as they deny the same right to others but i want them to understand this your efforts to silence mejust as your efforts to silence so many in puerto rico who disagree with your governmentwill fail just as every effort to blockade progress only makes the march toward justice more powerful and swift i may not be puerto rican enough for some people but i know this nowhere on earth will you find a people harder to silence than puerto ricans you wont locate my love for puerto rico on my birth certificate or on my drivers license or on my childrens birth certificate or any other piece of paper my love for puerto rico is right here in my heart a heart that beats with our history and our language and our heroes a place where when i moved there as a teenager people talked and argued and debated because we care deeply about our island and its future that is still true today that freedom is still beating in the hearts of university students working men and women labor leaders lawyers and environmentalists and every person who believes in free speech you will not silence them and you will not silence me abraham lincoln a leader who valued freedom above all else said those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves its good advice and i hope the leaders of

want us to invest in infrastructure build bridges highways clean energy and cut our dependence on foreign oil because when we make it in america thats when america will make it americans can make it cut yes what we ought to cut are the republican giveaways to the big oil companies to the wall street barons to the hedge fund managers who enjoy massive tax breaks thats where the cuts ought to be they ought to be cut out and what of this legislation thats before us we ought to vote no cut what doesnt create jobs for middle class families like republican giveaways to big oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to h r 2560 the cut cap and balance act this bill is an extreme version of the republican budget plan that would make permanent the dangerous budgetary and constitutional measures that would destroy medicare and medicaid and reduce social security benefits for those who need them the most the bill would also handicap the governments ability to respond to economic downturns and create jobs and it fails to address some of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of which we continue to wage this bill does nothing to end the tax breaks we currently provide for millionaires and billionaires hedge fund managers and oil companies nor does it address runaway pentagon spending based on cbos most conservative estimates the dod alone is projected to spend nearly 300 billion on the afghan and iraqi wars from 2012 through 2015 and estimates by harvard researchers which take into account longterm costs like caring for our veterans put the total cost of these wars in the trillions rather than ending tax breaks for corporations and millionaires and billionaires and bringing our troops home from afghanistan my friends on

safety net and to target resources where they are neededbasically to communities of color lowincome communities those communities rural areas who were hit hardest by the economic downturn its really beyond shameful that over 45 million americans including over 16 million children are living in poverty in the wealthiest nation in the world the data also shows a wide racial disparity with the poverty rates for whites standing at 9 8 percent while the rates for african americans and hispanics remain unacceptably high at 27 6 percent and 25 3 percent respectively in 2005 i founded the congressional out of poverty caucus because of the rising tide of poverty some of us saw this unfortunate day coming that was beginning under the failed policies of the previous administration of course we also know the terrible economic impact of the massive financial crisis that they left us on their way out of office with the swift efforts of president obama and congressional democrats we are finally beginning to dig ourselves out of the hole that was left by the bush administration and slowly moving the poverty rate in the right direction we must do more and we can do more one of the most critical responsibilities we have as a government is to promote and enact policies that keep our middle class strong and provide opportunities and a safety net for those striving and fighting to become middle class and to get into the ranks of the middle class to enhance their quality of life but far too many americans are continuing to suffer joblessness and have dropped out of the middle class and into poverty because of this republican donothing congress republicans in congress have continually blocked efforts to extend and expand vital safety net programs which safeguard millions of american families and children who face stark realities of unemployment hunger and homelessness further their continued blocking of critical federal support to our states and localities has caused widespread layoffs of dedicated public servants like teachers police officers and firefighters in communities all across the country this attack on our countrys public servants has had a particularly hard impact on communities of color and on women across the country i just have to tell you african americans and women have long found job opportunities in the public sector in public employment african americans in particular often found work with the city or the state because of racial bias and barriers and obstacles in the private sector the american people know that you cant have it both ways government spending cannot kill jobs on one hand when spent on hiring teachers and police officers and create jobs on the other hand and those services are desperately needed throughout our

schools and in programs that help struggling families are critical to boosting our economy and spurring our economic recovery tax cuts for millionaires dont pay for themselves they create massive deficits and weaken our country markets dont regulate themselves deregulation allows rampant fraud and creates massive bubbles that inevitably burst and threaten our entire economy we need a balanced

millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share so that we can reignite the american dream for all how this nation treats the least of these is not just a measure of our nations moral priorities

bulk of the winter season produce on the eastern seaboard in the early 1990s a settlement was negotiated with the large farming corporations where 20 000 acres of land were sold for roughly 100 million a negligible amount of 200 000 was allocated for the 2 500 farmworkers and most were simply given pink slips despite decades of service on the farm for years these workers were exposed to a chemical mixture of carcinogens and other contaminants as planes cropdusted the fields now these workers are suffering from an array of diseases that have been linked to longterm pesticide exposure their children suffer from defects cause by prenatal exposure to harmful contaminants these women have worked for over a decade to bring attention to their cause while many of their former colleagues unfortunately have passed away although these women are desperately seeking some relief and good health what they ask for more than anything else is their dignity dignity is the contribution of their community to feeding this nation and the sacrifices they made in doing so i would therefore offer my profound and earnest gratitude to these incredible women to their community and to farmworkers across the country for theirs truly are the hands that feed us now more than ever we need to redouble our efforts to reward hard work we must work to be sure that americans who work all of their lives have something to show for it this does not just affect linda lee or geraldine matthew we cannot ignore the fact that millions of americans have seen their retirement savings decimated their pensions shortchanged and their wages stagnant or falling even in the face of a rising tide of poverty and an economy with high unemployment the tea partyled republicans continue their efforts to slash programs which protect the health and wellbeing of millions of lowincome and working poor families in the coming weeks and months we will begin to see the impact of the quite frankly immoral cuts to vital unemployment benefit extensions as thousands of people thousands of people across our country who are struggling to find a job will be thrown off of unemployment benefits thrown off kicked off the rolls some of them may be lucky enough to find work but far too many will be suddenly cut off with nearly nothing nothing to keep them from falling behind into poverty they will have been left out and left behind we may disagree on how to help families in need and workers who are struggling find work access needed health services or feed their children but we can all agree that leaving struggling families completely cut off of unemployment insurance with nowhere to turn for help is not the american way when republican politicians protect tax cuts for millionaires we must be very adamant about protecting the working poor when tea party republicans fight to protect tax writeoffs for corporations and big oil we must fight to protect hardworking americans when republican tea party members continued to expend their energy protecting the dividend gains on investments we must fight to protect linda lee and geraldine matthew women who have worked their entire lives and are left with nothing to show for it unfortunately there are some who continue to support policies for the 1 percent where profits rather than people matter we need a jobs bill for those who are desperately in need of a job and we need to help with their support for themselves and their families so we do need a strong safety net to act as a bridge over these troubled economic times its critical to reaffirm that the needs and the aspirations of the poor and the working poor are really important and critical for us to address where they too are aspiring to be part of the middle class

strengthens the fabric of our communities our states our nation so the american jobs act according to experts is a phenomenal plan weve heard the republicans say we have some 30 bills that are about growing the economy and producing jobs when in fact when put under the test when reviewed by some very sound organizations out there and professional economists and analysts they said it would do precious nothing that it was not the formula its not what the doctor called for if we can stay on that healthcare related theme but the american jobs act well listen to some of the experts the chief economist at moodys analytics who by the way mark zandi was the former economic advisor for senator john mccain what does he theorize that anywhere from 1 9 million to 2 million jobs would be the outcome of the american jobs act something that not only produces the jobs but would reduce the unemployment rate by at least 1 percentage point thats a major significant factor what also happens is that when you produce those 2 million jobs youre addressing the gdp by at least 2 percentage points growth in the gdp reduction in the unemployment reducing the deficit putting people to work strengthening the economy providing purchasing power at a time when businesses are saying the best thing you can do get us customers a healthy economy putting people into the work mode creates customers it creates purchasing power it creates a strength in the economy two million jobs how can we walk away from a proposal oh i know why because there were those who spoke before cameras reaching all of america saying anything this president offers we wont do our goal is to make him a oneterm president my friends that is putting partisan politics petty partisan politics ahead of the interests the better interests of the american public where is that american spirit where is that sense of patriotism where is that sense of responsibility of leadership in this house and in the unitedstates senate that needs to go forward with the american jobs act representative garamendi i know weve been joined by another colleague it is just great to share this hour with you to talk about the progress we can taste that would lift every community in this great nation mr garamendi i was reading one of the hill magazines often called the hill rags and they said that the speaker of this house starts off his weekly press conference by asking where are the jobs well the jobs mr pwalker on dsk7tptvn1prod with house so long overdue and now to taste success and have it pulled away from the american health care consumers of this great nation is a very troubling notion mr garamendi well mr tonko thank you very much next monday did you know next monday is the annual birthday of medicare next monday it went into effect in 1965 and ever since as you said earlier republicans have been trying to terminate it they tried again this year but the american public knows better they know that they want to live long enough to get to medicare because in medicare they have a guaranteed benefit they know that wherever you are in the united states whether you are in vermont or in california you have the same quality policy that will cover most of what you need if you want more you can go out and buy that thats called the advantage program and you get to choose your program its not a government takeover at all in fact it is a financing mechanism so that every senior in america can choose their own provider they get to choose their provider they can go wherever they want to go to get their medical services and if they dont like their doctor they can change so the government is not saying where you can go in fact the government is financing the system so you can choose whatever provider you want to choose it is a common policy across the nation it is efficient and it is effective and the republicans are trying to destroy it we wont let that happen bottom line we will not let that happen and there are serious cost containments in the current medicare program and in the affordable care act im just going to end with this and then we really need to get to what we wanted to talk about which were the job programs the congressional budget office today estimated that the affordable care act over the next 10 years will reduce the deficit by 109 billion in the 20 years going out because of the cost containment in this system the affordable care act will reduce the deficit by over 1 trillion now thats worth engaging thats worth us doing and simultaneously provide far better health care to americans and far better access to health care wherever they may need it across this nation its a good thing when they want to stand up here and say obamacare im going youre right obama cares cares deeply about the very health of every single american thats why the affordable care act is in place today was found to be constitutional does reduce the deficit and does provide quality health care and choice of where you want to get your medical care mr tonko my colleague from california just indicated that there would be a favorable deficit outcome because of the affordable care act speaker were proposed last september by president obama the american jobs act two million jobs minimum could have been created this is one of the great woulda coulda shouldas of our time we could have had people back to work today and in doing so reducing the deficit there are so many different pieces of this the american jobs act are where the jobs are you talked about a piece of it im going to just pick up one more this is one that speaks to the american homes whats going on in the house where we live many of those homes are run down they have problems with insulation or they dont have any insulation at all they leak energy well the president proposed as a piece of the american jobs act that we could provide construction jobs really lowskilled construction jobs in rehabilitating the american homes this is not a new concept this has been going on for some time its been used repeatedly to upgrade homes in the united states and simultaneously save energy and save dollars for the american public one piece of it construction jobs could have been put in place im going to pick up another one and then im going to turn it back to you mr tonko my daughter is a teacher my soninlaw is a teacher theyve seen their class size just grow from 20 22 to some 32 people in the class now this is a serious problem for the teacher making it more difficult to provide the quality teaching thats necessary my daughter is a great teacher my soninlaw is too but its much more difficult the class size has increased by a third the american jobs act would have put 280 000 teachers back into the classroom now if you happen to be a secondgrader and youre not getting what you need to learn then thats going to carry on through the remaining years of your schooling and so 280 000 teachers could have been brought back into the classroom had the american jobs act passed b 2030 mr tonko mr tonko yes they are both significant bits of legislation so its good to interlace the american jobs act and the affordable care act to the 280 000 teachers i think its very easy to state that the human infrastructure in our school systems across this nation are a critical component to quality education that personal relationship of students to teacher the exercise of selfdiscovery who am i what are my gifts what are my talents what are my passions that is exercised in the classroom that is a spirit that prevails its a magic that happens in the classroom and that sense of selfdiscovery part of our goal here is not only to enable these students to

labor force who wanted and were available for work and who looked for a job at some point during the last 12 months and so it becomes obvious that any budget should have at its core jobcreation opportunities so that people can experience this opportunity or this commodity that we call work appearances of an economy poised for growth does little for underserved minorities residing in disinvested communities blighted with high rates of joblessness poorperforming schools poverty and crime indeed the promise of a new day and new hopes are few and far between for poor and lowincome workers generally and returning citizens with barriers to employment in particular indeed over the past decade the poor in america have gotten poorer and of course the wealthy have gotten wealthier those called middle class have been squeezed to the point where theyre teetering and certainly could go in either direction that is up with the right kinds of opportunities and down with the wrong kinds of opportunities i dont believe that we can afford in good conscience to continue to turn a blind eye to census figures and monthly data reports of the economic injustices and suffering being imposed upon a growing number of people moreover we cannot continue to hold a great nation hostage for the sake of a few while millions suffer if were truly going to address the crisis in america and put all americans back to work and reduce poverty we must create a mixture of universal and targeted programs capable of weathering political obstacles the congressional black caucus alternative budget is a means to this end indeed the cbc budget safeguards investment in public education pell grants and transportation vital to equipping minority youth and adults with skill sets so that they can obtain and maintain access to gainful sustainable employment in our everchanging global economy and also by renovating and building new schools and investing an additional 50 billion in transportation and infrastructure in 2013 and 155 billion above the presidents budget over the next decade repairing and building bridges across lakes rivers and streams but also bridges to opportunity the congressional black caucus budget protects the health care safety net programs that have been developed it also protects second chance funding while restoring funding to department of justice programs for citizens who are returning home from jail and prison with serious barriers to employment we hold these truths to be selfevident that if america is to become the america that it has never been but the america that all of us hope for and know that it can be then we would take the principles encased in the congressional black caucus budget and comply those to whatever budgets are ultimately passed so again i want to commend mr scott and i want to thank delegate"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "for a great number of hours today in this chamber there has been a great debate on whether or not to repeal the affordable care act when we know fully that the chances are slim to move forward and the measure would not be signed into law is it political posturing i believe it is of a grand style theres a pattern being established here theres been an attackoutright attackon social security attempts to privatize the system its been under attack for the last 76 years its been the underpinning that provides stability for working families across this great nation it has been a security piece that has enabled many to have at least assurances that there would be some support in family budgets as they move month to month we know that that measure social security has been dealing with its enemies for a long timesince before it was made a law likewise medicare which came to us in the midsixties enabled our senior community to have its health care needs met provided predictability and stability for retired households enabled people to enjoy a quality of life a better quality of health care we know that before medicare many of those who had retired expected to see their economic security dip south because of the expected cost of providing health care when they perhaps could not get that coverage in an insurance context so medicare as we know it today would be undone by the republican majority in this house they would prefer to privatize social security allow us to reach to the financial sector to perhaps see a repeat of what happened to so many individuals and families out there with this past recession where they saw their lifetime savings wiped away trillions lost in the american economy pain and suffering endured by families across this land theyd rather see a voucher system for medicare handing it over to the insurance companies to leave seniors digging deeper into their pockets so the pattern has been established here and now a repeal of the affordable care act before its full implementation before given a chance as we arrive as the last industrialized nation in the world to provide a universal health care coverage program unacceptable progress is struck a decision is rendered by the highest court in the land a conservativeleaning court before the ink is dry on that decision a move to repeal the court spoke it has spoken to america and said the litmus test for constitutionality was debated and a decision rendered that said yes in fact it meets the constitutionality test and so this evening on the eve of the attempts to repeal the affordable care act as it stands is a very telling moment it is one that suggests to us that there is this outright attempt to undo programs that serve our middle class so very well and without a thriving middle class our nation is not prosperous without that thriving middle class theres not purchasing power strong enough to provide the recovery of our economy without a strengthening of our middle class there is not a confidence in the economy a confidence that is needed so as to grow more customers for our business base and so the affordable care act is offering promise and hope to millions tens of millions of americans across this land whether youre insured underinsured uninsured all categories will see strengthening because of this measure think of it i represent a large proportion of senior citizens who are concerned about their pharmaceutical costs many dealing with that doughnut hole have reached that threshold that requires them to dig into their pockets we close that doughnut hole we make more affordable the prescriptions that are required for people to stay well and in some cases to have the medications that keep them alive we deny that opportunity to our nations seniors we deny the respect that we offer we deny the dignity in the equation that speaks to affordable outcomes for the pharmaceuticals that our senior community requires that doughnut hole would have been closed by 2020 further at the other end of the age spectrum many young adults finding it difficult in this recessionand now the recovery periodto gain a job as they perhaps leave high school or college are given the opportunity with the affordable care act to remain on their familys policy until the age of 26 therein lies a strong benefit for some 6 6 million young adults denied with the repeal measure denying access and affordability to health care situations how many cases of young adults impacted by catastrophic illness or accidents will it require to turn the hearts and the minds in a positive direction that would not forego this opportunity for our nations young adults a strong benefit associated with this package what about those who have a preexisting condition some 17 million children in that category and thats not to account for the many adults who would be denied because of preexisting conditions asthma in children diabetes in our senior community being a woman utilized as a preexisting condition an opportunity to deny coverage and the basic core need that we should consider to be truly american another benefit lost to the greedy notion of repealing success that was achieved in this house and the united states senate and signed into law by this president what about the efforts to deny lifetime benefits as a threshold cutting people off of an insurance coverage at perhaps a very demanding time in their lives games played with people and their lives and their recovery hope pulled from working families across this nation because of an insensitivity of this congress a deplorable situation assistance to our small business community now if we profess our small business community to be the economic engine that is part and parcel of our economic comeback our economic springboard then would we not want to provide assistance in that basic core need area would we not want to allow tax credits to come the way of our small business community many a majority of those businesses will remind all of us as representatives that they want to provide for their employees they want a productive workforce that means a strong and well workforce and so they see it as a strong investment one however that they could not afford in recent years because of the escalating costs 18 percent larger bill than industry and perhaps weaker coverage they wanted that turned around they wanted a smart approach a businesslike approach a sensitive response they got it with the affordable care act progress denied the small business engine weakened by this sort of neglect that could be advanced in this cited pattern of undoing social security privatizing social security changing medicare as we know it forever now repealing the affordable care act we see the pattern we see the gross neglect the disrespect for americas middle class her working families so we go forward and we understand that with the opportunities of an exchange small employers our small business community understands that if theyre unable to enter into an exchange where all the private sector participants agree to play by the rules to sharpen their pencils roll up their sleeves provide the service live within the parameters and allow for the many to enter into a common exchange to provide corresponding benefits think of it if 1 of 10 in that employee firm of 20 were to be impacted with catastrophic illness its devastating an actuarial impact that hits that small business owner hard in the pocketbook because of the premium increase for that 1 person of the 10 you employ if those same 10 employees were allowed to enter the exchange a better outcome a different outcome a stronger outcome for the economic recovery of this nation because the gross majority of jobs being produced in this comeback are being done by our small business community and so you know the formula is quite obvious we want a comeback we want that strongest response here from washington for that kick that we endured from a recession that drained us of 8 2 million jobs the best way to do it first of three principles small business provide for the strengthening of small business which the affordable care act does because that small business community has forever been the pulse of american enterprise secondly invest in that entrepreneur the dreamer the mover the shaker it always stretched us since our days of pioneer spirit with the industrial revolution and the westward movement very familiar to the district i represent which is the donor area to the erie canal in upstate new york in the capital region mohawk valley that pioneer spirit exists in our fabric today its our dna invest in the entrepreneur to be the ideas economy kingpin we rely on these wizards to build us sustain us stretch us empower us and then finally invest in a thriving middle class which the affordable care act does it enables us as a middle class community to be bolstered by the confidence the security the stability that has come with this success story in guaranteeing access and affordability to quality health care that will underscore the value of wellness and not just deal with illness that will put together efforts to cost contain that will bring people into a structured program so that we can monitor their activities and connect them to a system you know youll hear from some on the floor we dont want to pay for this its going to cost us too much were paying today for the neglect for the consequences of a notsoperfect system status quo will not cut it and so we need to go forward with progressive policies with the soundness of reform with the boldness of transition with the confidence we can instill with the progressiveness of policies that we can draft and so it is a sad note here echoed in this chamber that would attempt to unravel dilute destroy deny the promise we can make to america as i look at this effort for a comeback the containment of health care costs is just one of those areas that we need to help control create that better environment in which to grow jobs cultivate a prosperity its important its important for us to understand that it is part of an economic recovery equation but theres also the wisdom of investing in education in higher education again under attack by a system that does not always profess the strength of research and education and patents and discovery we understand that we are in the midst of a global race on innovation clean energy and ideas and high tech to be outstanding competitors to arrive at that race ready to conquer we will need to be strong and fit in order to be the winning agent on that global scene we saw that order of passion we saw that order of investment in the global race on space just decades ago this nation impacted by a sputnik moment dusted off its backside and said never again never again and what was the result together a nation grew in its commitment to winning the global race on space we are going to be that agent that nation that proud people that would stake the american flag on the moon and we won that race because of a commitment because of investment in the soundness of the people of this great country and her business community we embraced research we embraced science we believed in our strength as a people and the confidence exuded was the elixir that brought us to the victory where is that like passion today where is that leadership a rather youthful president that led us in the sixties and challenged us in almost replication today finds us interestingly to be challenged by a rather youthful president asking us to enter into the global sweepstakes committing with passion to the cause and so we need that investment in education in higher education and research just today in schenectady new york in the 21st congressional district of new york that im proud to represent we announced formally the creation of the advanced battery manufacturing center at that facility of ge ceo jeff immelt traveled for the celebration came to town to announce this wonderful wonderful addition that is america at work with her genius activity thats america determined to win the global race on ideas advanced battery manufacturing the battery the linchpin to so much potential out there to grow domestic supplies of energy to grow jobs as we grow our energy future to reduce the gluttonous dependency on fossilbased fuels oftentimes imported from some of the most unfriendly nations to the united states sending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to those foreign treasuries that are then used to train troops to fight against our own daughters and sons on the battlefield unacceptable there is a better way and this congress knows it we invest in jobs we invest in health care we invest in education we invest in research we do it in a way that promises our best attempt as a nation to generations yet unborn someone was there for us and we need to be there for future generations of americans to provide the sort of cuttingedge opportunity that will spell america at her best i look at that opportunity for not only battery manufacturing but nanotechnology and semiconductor signs chip manufacturing the newly designed 20th congressional district in new york that comprises a good portion of the now existing 21st district that i represent is probably one of the most technology investedin congressional districts in the country it is happening because there is this belief in the worker a belief in the entrepreneur a belief in the small business community a belief in the industrial context of the district and knowing full well that americas needsbe they for the environment or energys sake or business creation job creation business opportunityare inspiring this remarkable progress it requires our moving forward with a plan it requires our moving forward academically with the soundness of policy and with the corresponding resource advocacy that will yield lucrative dividends i see it all the time i see it in energyefficiency programs that produce jobs that enable us to capture waste heat that is part of the energy process enabling us to be much more efficient efforts that enable us to create more and more patents in a world that has grown much more competitive much more sophisticated we can ill afford to weaken in our attempts to be the kingmakers of the international economy the old american spirit the history of this nation replete with those rags to riches scenarios that became the reason and the inspiration for the compilation of journeys made by our ancestors to these shores because the opportunity called the american dream became the prize for which they searched i see it in my own roots the proudest label i carry in life is as the grandson of immigrants their journey gave me great opportunity and it gave my family great opportunity those journeys chased after the american dream we need beginning in this house chamber to reignite the american dream to go back to the core essence of who we are as a people to reach into that american heart and soul that has forever relied on its passion that we can achieve because we have opportunity and that we will not deny that opportunity that we will strengthen the boldness of those dreams and enable us to respond to the needs of the moments and the future and to write our legacy as a generation of americans let us not fail in that attempt let us continue to reach deep into that american spirit at a time when we were challenged and our economy was brought to its knees by failed policies that did not manage well that did not provide for the stewardship of our resources and when we tripped and fell let it be known that in the recovery we were stronger than ever before because of that belief that our best days lay ahead of us the belief that those best days were in the future we moved forward and we dug deep into that american spirit to respond with the respect for americas middle class our middle classall of us in that middle classhave always understood if you play hard if you abide by the rules if you roll up your sleeves and do your best you could rightfully anticipate the taste of success that is america in her most shining moments and that is an economy that we can produce it begins with the soundness of a strong and productive workforce that went through training and retraining that got to taste the potential for success by that self discovery that comes with education and to then understand our gifts so that we could share them in the most profound way and then to provide for the wellness of that workforce so it could be most productive so that the conditioning that came with that sort of commitment and that order of respect and that potion of dignity could then allow for us to speak to a nation that was humbled by its own beginnings where the rightful stories of so many who made it their journey were written by a nation that believed in her people so tonight on this eve of an attempt to repeal the affordable care act let us understand that our budget here in washington our actions with legislation our responsiveness to the needs of the american people are an establishment of our prioritiesa prescription of what we see our future to bea reaching into the heart to say that we are a truly caring lot thats what separates us from other nations it is the uniqueness of america and her greatness the affordable care act is a measurement of not only sound policy it is a statement of a compassionate society that understands its not about oneself that its about neighbors that its about community that its about the great society it has been the history through the decades through the vintages of time that has enabled us to reach to the greatness of our government to reach to the soundness of ideas and innovation to respond to the challenges that have enabled us to build upon those who preceded us always anticipating that the next generation would be made stronger we owe it to our children and grandchildren and generations yet unborn let them look at this moment in history american history knowing that america was challenged that she stepped up to the plate and said yes to her people and

package the president promised 3 years ago that the stimulus would create what he characterized as millions of jobs but today unfortunately devastatingly there are nearly 13 million people in america who are still unemployed and many millions more have even given up on looking for jobs three years ago the white house said that because of the stimulus package unemployment would not exceed 8 percent that has not happened in fact the unemployment rate has topped 8 percent for 36 straight months nowthe longest stretch of high unemployment since the great depression the congressional budget office predicts it is going to go even longer we will not see sub8 percent unemployment according to the cbo until 2014 the president sold his stimulus package to the american people by claiming he would make immediate investments in what he characterized as shovelready jobs but last june the president acknowledged that shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected nevertheless a lot of money has been spent as we have been waiting for these jobs to materializejobs that never quite came about in fact some of it was spent in ways that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy for example consider some of the ways in which this stimulus money has been spent mr president 760 000 was spent on interactive dance software 1 2 million was spent on a train museum 2 million was spent to study ant behavior 762 000 was spent to study improvised musici am not sure what that is but i am sure it is lovely not necessarily deserving of scarce federal resources 300 000 to track weather on other

4 trillion to the national debt we have recorded the three largest annual deficits in our nations history and we are on pace for a fourth straight deficit exceeding 1 trillion this week the president submitted a budget that calls for adding 11 trillion in new debt over the next decade his own treasury secretary calls the level of spending unsustainable and it is despite the overwhelming evidence that his stimulus package has failed the president has called for additional increases in spending i know the president is a good man i also know he faced a difficult economy when he took office but the president is unwilling to tell the truth to the american people about what lies ahead about some of the challenges we face i think he needs to do so and he needs to acknowledge the fact that this stimulus package has failed so we can avoid making similar mistakes in the future today we cannot celebrate the anniversary of the presidents stimulus rather we must lament a tremendous lost

bill created the unitedstates marshals service when president george washington signed the judiciary act of 1789 this was the same bill that created the entire federal judicial system and today the unitedstates marshals service remains the nations oldest federal law enforcement agency my home state of arkansas has a proud chapter in the history of the unitedstates marshals service as a young state arkansas sat on the western edge of a growing nation in the late 1800s and it would be the unitedstates marshals and their deputies based out of forth smith arkansas that had jurisdiction over 74 000 square miles an area where countless numbers of dangerous criminals fled into indian territory to escape prosecution home to judge parkers courthouse fort smith became the center of law and order in the western united states throughout much of the late 19th century charles portis 1968 novel true grit first introduced fort smith arkansas to many americans and its role in the history of the unitedstates marshals service an arkansan born and raised in el dorado arkansas in my congressional district charles portis later saw his novel turned into the 1969 movie starring arkansas native and recording artist singer glen campbell and john wayne as unitedstates marshal rooster cogburn and more recently the 2010 remake of the movie featuring jeff bridges in the same role the importance of fort smith arkansas to the unitedstates marshals service is in part why the city will also be home to the unitedstates marshals museum to be funded partly by sales from the unitedstates marshals service 225th anniversary commemorative coin when finished the unitedstates marshals museum will be a world class national museum with over 20 000 square feet helping to share the history and legacy of the unitedstates marshals service most importantly it will serve as a memorial for all of those within the unitedstates marshals service who gave their lives in service to our country today more than 4 000 unitedstates marshals deputy marshals and criminal investigators make up the modern unitedstates marshals service carrying out many of the duties first assigned to them more than two centuries ago our unitedstates marshals and deputy marshals protect the federal judicial system apprehend federal fugitives seize property house and transport federal prisoners and operate the witness security program they continue to risk their lives to preserve and protect law and order the very basic tenet of our american democracy and yes our way of life this bill which will not add a single dime to the deficit will allow our nation to recognize honor and thank the sacrifices that so many unitedstates marshals and deputy marshals have made to this country over the past 225 years it will

theft act of 2012 or simply the stop identity theft act many of you have seen the recent headlines calling attention to the escalating nationwide epidemic of tax return identity theft an unsuspecting taxpayer goes to file their tax return only to be told by the internal revenue service that someone else has already filed and claimed their hardearned tax refund this happened to one of my constituents joan rubenstein who was a 64yearold teacher when her accountant filed her 2010 tax return in april of last year he was told by the irs that she had already filed joan followed advice and filed a police report and reached out to the irs but after 10 months she still had not received her refund only after working with my district office were we able secure her refund which she desperately needed to assist her daughter with her student loan payments for her 2011 tax return joan was informed by the irs taxpayer advocates office that she was okay to proceed with filing her return this year yet shockingly joans accountant filed only to learn that she was once again a victim of tax return identity theft for a second year in a row no one should have to go through the trauma of having their hardearned tax refund stolen and certainly not 2 years in a row and joan is not alone this case unfortunately is not an anomaly my office has been inundated with constituents who have also had their tax refunds stolen and i know this is a rampant problem in chairman smiths district and his home state of texas as well the amount of theft that goes on with this type of case is really astronomical its stories like joans that prompted me to file this legislation that is before us on the floor today the crime of tax return identity theft has quickly emerged over the last few years and congress must act to quickly address this epidemic tax return identity theft wreaks emotional and financial havoc on hardworking taxpayers like joan and costs the federal government billions of dollars in 2011 alone the irs reported thatlisten to these numbers851 602 tax returns and 5 8 billion were associated with fraudulent tax returns involving identity theft thats a 280 percent increase since just 2010 these tax return identity thieves hide behind a veil of technology by stealing social security numbers and filing false electronic returns where the payoffs are almost instantaneous right now more thieves and criminal organizations are turning to this lucrative lowrisk highreward crime because law enforcement lacks the kind of stiff criminal penalties afforded many other forms of identity theft essentially because of the small likelihood of getting caught and the very minimal current penalty it makes sense for these thieves to roll the dice because the chances of getting caught and actually doing any time at all is very low in this instance technology has simply outstripped the enforcement tools that are currently on the books basically this crime is worth it for the criminals who are committing it and we need to make sure that it is not worth it any more so they dont have incentive to continue and they move on to the next thing and then we can go after them for that we must protect the thousands of taxpayers like joan who fall victim to this crime many of whom belong to vulnerable groups like seniors veterans and even minors the stop identity theft act brings together several measures to strengthen criminal penalties and increase the prosecution rate of tax return identity thieves h r 4362 will add tax return fraud to the list of predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft the aggravated identity theft statute was created in 2004 to fight identity theft crimes committed to facilitate other types of felonies however at the time the problem of tax return identity theft was very new and it wasnt included as part of the predicate offenses under aggravated identity theft today it has become an urgent nationwide problem and we must give law enforcement the additional tools needed to combat this crime each of the last two administrations have called for adding tax fraud to the predicate offenses under aggravated identity theft with this change the stop identity theft act will toughen sentencing for tax return identity thieves which will help deter this kind of crime importantly the legislation also expands the definition of an identity theft victim to include businesses and charitable organizations often these organizations have their identities stolen and used in phishing schemes to extract the sensitive information from unsuspecting taxpayers used in tax return thefts essentially what happens and weve all been warned about this you get an email from what you think is your bank or the charitable organization that you are used to giving donations to but its really not because these thieves have stolen that organizations identity and they are asking for your personal information and unsuspecting victims give them that information by the way you should never do that because your bank and charitable organization wont ask you for personal information these thieves then use the harvested information to file thousands of fraudulent tax returns in fact on the irs web site it is noted that this type of phishing scheme is the most common one seen by the irs this amendment to the identity theft statutes will ensure that thieves who misappropriate the identities of any business be it a small business or a nonprofit organization can be prosecuted"], [0.9999995231628418, 0.9999995231628418, 0, "i rise in

protections for those who object to abortion as a staunch supporter of prolife principles i strongly urge this house to pass h r 358 the protect life act it is important for congress to remember that our work in pursuing healthcare reform is to move our society toward accessible medical coverage across the nation especially for the poor and marginalized h r 358 builds off these tenets and enhances the compromise language that was developed by former congressman bart stupak of michigan and other prolife members of congress to restrict federal funds from being used for abortion coverage under the health reform act passed in the last congress although the stupak language upheld the key tenets of the hyde amendment h r 358 provides further clarification on that matter the protect life act provides clearer conscience protection for institutions and individual health care providers i commend the gentlemen from pennsylvania mr joe pis for his work on this bill and for his persistence in

important bipartisan legislation reinforces fundamental rights enshrined in the unitedstates constitution by allowing any person with a valid stateissued concealed firearm permit to carry a concealed firearm in any state that issues concealed firearm permits as an avid hunter and outdoorsman and as a lifetime member of the national rifle association i can share with personal experience the frustration of my fellow hunters and outdoorsmen the absurdity of having to know which states recognize visiting permit holders from other states and which states that do not our country should not force its lawabiding citizens to check in their fundamental right to selfdefense at the state line the national righttocarry reciprocity act would clarify this matter by requiring states that allow concealed carry to recognize each others permits similar to how states recognize each others drivers licenses righttocarry laws also help deter crime presently 40 states have righttocarry laws based on crime data from the fbi righttocarry states have 22 percent lower total violent crime rates in comparison to the rest of the country in my home state of texas violent crime has dropped 20 percent and the murder rate has dropped 31 percent since the enactment of its righttocarry law in 1996 this legislation is also inline with recent rulings found by the unitedstates supreme court in 2008 in district of columbia v heller and again in 2010 in mcdonald v city of chicago the high court found the right to possess a firearm for selfdefense cannot be infringed i am a proud cosponsor of the bill

which will strengthen minnesotas health care system and economy the food and drug administration reform act reauthorizes the fdas drug and medical device user fee programs at a critical time if these user fees are not reauthorized before the end of june the fda will not have the funding it needs to ensure lifesaving drugs and medical devices are available to patients in a timely fashion this bill also accelerates approval of treatments to address rare diseases reauthorizes two successful pediatric programs and helps to prevent drug shortages that are affecting families across the country overall the reforms in h r 5651 bring the fda into the 21st century by making the agency more responsive to changes in the unitedstates health care system and better equipped to oversee a globalized market for medical products this legislation will deliver safer treatments faster innovation and better care for millions of american patients and families this legislation is especially important for americas medical device sector the approval process for medical devices at the fda slowed by as much as 60 percent since 2005 according to the general accountability office while longer approval times do not contribute to patient safety they have delayed or even denied lifesaving treatments to patients and undermined the international competitiveness of the unitedstates medical device industry there is general agreement that the broken approval process for medical devices is doing real harm to patients and workers this is especially concerning for minnesota because our state is a hub of medical device innovation the sector employs thousands of highlyskilled workers in our state h r 5651 reforms and reauthorizes the medical device user fee program through fiscal year 2017 providing years of stability and increased regulatory certainty for companies that range from local small business startups to global fortune 500 enterprises moreover the bill will foster innovation in the sector by speeding market access for new and improved medical devices without compromising patient safety the food and drug administration reform act is a rare bipartisan success story this legislation comes to the house floor after months of close bipartisan collaboration the senate approved a bill very similar to h r 5651 by a vote of 96 to 1 the house energy and commerce committee voted 46 to 0 to move h r 5651 to the floor both democratic and republican members of congress understand that a highquality health care system requires a strong and effective fda todays bill is a
