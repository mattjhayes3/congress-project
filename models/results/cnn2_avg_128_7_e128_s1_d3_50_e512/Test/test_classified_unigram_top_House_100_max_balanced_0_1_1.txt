{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise today in response to the unrelenting assault on amercas elderly and poor that assault is most clearly and most recently reflected in the administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding americas most vulnerable"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i join with so many of my other colleagues in thanking him both for providing this time and for the thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country this legislative body and all of our lives much richer than we would otherwise have known without the opportunity and privilege of calling sala burton a very close and special friend"], [2.050691394472892e-09, 2.050691394472892e-09, 0, "i appreciate my friend the gentleman from pennsyavania for holding this time available and discussing the very serious developments in nicaragua i find it fascinating that all of our friends on the left who were eager to come down here and explain what is wrong with the government of el salvadoe or eager to explain what is wrong with the freedom fighters in nicaragua suddenly cannot find any spare time to talk about what the communist dictatorship in nicaragua is doing i can appreciate the difficulty that our friends on the left have because the dictatorship in nicaragua is posing a problem about reality the reality that secret police and armies backed by the soviets and cubans if they are willing to be ruthless and brutal can do a great deal to stop those who love freedom and the fact is that those who wish to be free in the absence of some kind of strength may lose their freedom to a slavery imposed by tyrants i would ask if i might for just a moment to go through the recent repressive actions the communists have taken which include the following on may 31 mario alegria and pablo morales two officials of privatesector research institutes were detained by the secret police their personal materials seized and houses searched imagine if members will that the american federal bureau of investigation had gone into the brookings institution and the heritage foundation here in washington and arrested two officials because the reagan administration did not agree with their views that would give one some idea of what the communist government in nicaragua did on may 31 on june 1 the interior ministry ordered radio catolicas news program to shut down for 10 days and radio corporacions news programs to close for 8 days for quoting from a resistance press release in other words imagine cbs news was ordered off the air for 10 days and that nbc news or abc news was ordered off the air for 8 days or cnn was ordered off the air because the government did not like what they were saying that is what the nicaraguan communists are doing on june 9 15 members of a delegation of leaders of the democratic opposition were arrested as they peacefully walked to the national assembly to petition for repeal of the media law under which independent radio news programs had been suspended imagine if you will that 15 members of the democratic party arrived in atlanta and were arrested because they disagreed with the reagan administration on june 23 liberal party members were sentenced to 90day prison terms for distributing peace literature i think this is an important thing for our friends on the american left to understand those in nicaragua who want peace and freedom are threatened by the secret police threatened by the communist army threatened by a communist dictatorship to simply wish for freedom as those who opposed nazi germany discovered to their horror without the strength to uphold freedom is to risk slavery or death on july 3 as an example of that death trade union leader carlos garcia was shot in the head in his home by police who were ostensibly advising him to report for reserve military service in other words if one is a union leader who believes in freedom and in free trade unions in communist nicaragua one may be shot in ones own home and killed by the secret police on july 10 the police violet tly broke up a peaceful march of 3 000 persons in nandaime fortythree persons were arrested again we are going to see in atlanta back home in georgia we are going to see thousands of protesters demonstrating outside the democratic convention and we are going to see politicans of the opposition party gathering peacefully and imagine that 43 were to be arrested myriam arguello was taken from her home early the morning of july 10 and that is the secret police invaded her home to arrest her in order to intimidate those who want to be free finally on july 11 the sandinistas the nicaraguan communists suspended the publication of the newspaper la prensa for alleged subversive activities and closed radio catolica for reporting the nandaime demonstration the point of reading that list is this there is an unequivocal set of recent repressive action that the nicaraguan communists have taken those actions are indisputable the new york times reports them the washington post reports them no one doubts that they have been taken those actions after the nicaraguan communists have met in secret with the speaker of this house and those actions after the leftwing democrats in this house have cut off aid to the freedom fighters those actions after the leftwing democrats promised us that if only we were reasonable the nicaraguan communists would be reasonable i think there is a great burden that the democrats leadership in this house has to look up to that governor dukakis has to meet next week and that is very simple what are we going to do in america when faced on our southern border with a commu nist dictatorship which has proven once again in the last few days that it is willing to crush freedom using its secret police"], [1.0549015883043467e-08, 1.0549015883043467e-08, 0, "it is probably the most dedicated soviet satellite

consistently prosoviet embracing the soviet model he has established a marxistleninist party a vast network of informers and secret police state ownership and the collectivization of agriculture his

banks like the world bank give the regime highly concessional loans and economic assistance western countries need to recognize that our policies of appeasement and hope have not moderated the ways of

famine and starvation and millions more will die as president reagan said in his 1985 address to the united nations freedom is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few we champion freedom not only

hunger fear and the burdens placed on their loved ones the workers who walked out of the shipyards held their heads high and did not back down from their demands for the legalization of the solidarity labor unionthe only way in which the polish government can achieve anything resembling true economic reform in poland on the surface polish workers on strike at nowa huta gdansk and in other areas of the country were protesting huge price increases that would further impoverish them without changing the way in which the economy is ordered according to an article in yesterdays wall street journal polands gross national product stands at about its 1978 level while real per capita income is only 78 percent of what it was 10 years ago solidarity economists have reported that between 2533 percent of poles now live below the poverty line half of all polish workers die before reaching retirement age giving the country the highest mortality rate for workers in all of europe the wait for an apartment can take as long as 50 years health care is in a disgraceful stateneeded medicines cannot be obtained diagnostic equipment is obsolete or not available at all and the environment is in such sad shape that a new grassroots social organizationthe freedom and peace movementhas devoted itself almost exclusively to this vital issue and has seen its membership swell in recent years all of these problems point to the failure of the polish government to implement an economic reform package able to meet the needs of the polish people the workers rose up in protest not just because of price increases but because true economic reform cannot take place without real political reform as solidarity chairman lech walesa has said reform must be based on the citizens natural right to economic initiatives and interprises and this can only come about if the citizens of poland are given the right to form their own trade unions to join other organizations not dominated by the government and to work toward institutional guarantees which will ensure a pluralistic society what gave me a great deal of hope for the situation in poland was the youth of the workers that struck at gdansk most were too young to appreciate the events leading up to legalization of solidarity in 1980 and yet these were the very workers who were chanting no freedom without solidarity and often appeared to be more militant than their elders who had experienced labor unrest in the past on monday it was these young workers who refused to accept a compromise that was largely agreed to by the strike committee only when the prospect of a police attack looked imminent did these young men agree with their older leaders to leave the shipyard the reverend henryk jankowski pastor of the nearby st brygldas church called them wonderful young men who he could not allow to be beaten i want to conmend our president for speaking out and condemning the use of force against the workers it was statements like these which made the polish government think twice about doing at gdansk what was done at nowa huta i sincerely hope the president will continue to watch the situation closely in poland prominent solidarity activists like bodgan lis and wladislaw frasyniuk still remain in jail and the polish government may still take retribution against those who took part in the strike far from being a failure the strikes in poland represented in the words of chairman walesa a new spring for solidarity they reaffirm the demand for workers in a supposedly worker state to have a voice in

and the soviet empire it can be divided into three phases in the first phase presidents truman and eisenhower recognized march 11 1 987 the threat of communism i think they were able to educate the american people to the threat and they eventually created the policies which contained the expansion of the soviets the revolution of policies and organizations led by truman dwarfs anything we have seen since six years of strenuous effort and debate by truman and others against isolationists of the right and left led to a large peacetime military the central intelligence agency the north atlantic treaty organization the marshall plan greekturkish aid point iv the unified department of defense the concept of containment the berlin airlift the rio treaty and fighting a war to stop communist aggression in korea by 1958 these policies were working the soviet empire was contained and japan and western europe were protected against conventional military attack the second phase began with the sovietcommunist strategy of inciting transnational conflicts as the way to extend the soviet empire the communists had found a weakness in the free world policy of containment using lenins strategy for seizing power in third world countries the soviets discovered that the wests legal political diplomatic and military systems had no effective response to transnational conflict western policy was based on clear cut distinctions between war and peace legality and illegality civil war and foreign aggression by using the language of the west to disguise communist transnational strategies the soviets confused and divided the west ho chi minh used the language of the declaration of independence to deceive american and european liberals about his intent to impose communism on vietnam and all of south east asia castro posed as a reformer while consolidating power as a communist castros charade is still believed by many leftwing democrats 26 years later as evidence by the march 19 and 20 1986 house debate on nicaragua presidents eisenhower and kennedy began to develop a policy for an american response to communist transnational strategies the armys special forces were dramatically enlarged by president kennedy jfks alliance for progress included both the peace corps and green beret advisers who trained the bolivian troops who tracked down che guevara and wiped out the communist guerrillas under kennedys leadership communism was challenged from the berlin wall to the jungles of laos and vietnam united states political economic and military power were used aggressively and risks were taken to let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty kennedy felt so strongly about stopping communism that he risked nuclear war in the cuban missile crisis he mobilized the national guard during the berlin wall crisis he launched a major buildup of the unitedstates military troops in vietnam by november 1963 communism was losing the second phase and the free world was developing an effective transnational strategy for freedom after kennedys assassination president johnson proved unable to fill the intellectual moral political leadership vacuum that was left by jfks death the anticommunist democratic party of truman kennedy and senator hubert humphrey began to disintegrate by 1972 the ideologically isolationist democrats had seized control of their party and nominated george mcgovern mcgoverns foreign policy background was as a 1948 henry wallace progressive he had opposed trumans policy of aiding greece in 1947 and he actively opposed the traditional bipartisan policy of anticommunism with the landslide of richard nixon there was still hope of continuing a strong anticonununist foreign policy however the newly isolationist democrats in congress thwrarted his policies watergate accelerated the collapse of the american centrist bipartisan anticommunist consensus in the 1974 election mcgoverns antiwar activists won spectacular and improbable victories the economic pain caused by the oil price increases and the political pain of watergate corruption lead to political upheaval the 1974 election winners were overwhelmingly left wing ideologues who were deeply opposed to an active anticommunist foreign policy the mcgovernites moved quickly to impose their views in the house and senate they voted to cut off aid to south vietnam the ensuing north vietnamese communist offensive captured another colony for the soviet empire they cut off aid to cambodia the communists allied with vietnam and the soviets proceeded to kill over a million people in a holocaust fresh from permitting freedom to be killed in southeast asia the american left turned to africa they cut off american help to anticommunist forces in angola and mozambique the soviets responded to the lefts timidity by flying 35 000 cuban troops into angola to impose a communist colonial dictatorship let me make this point again because it is an example of why i talk about the american left running from reality when they stood on this floor today and talked about a moratorium and talked about being reasonable and talked about negotiating with the communists in nicaragua one had to ask oneself have they learned nothing from the last 25 years the last experiment in unilateral surrender in africa by the american left led the soviets to fly 35 000 cuban troops into angola now what do they think the american collapse incentral america is going to lead to some kind of newfound reasonableness on the part of the soviet empire having not entirely wiped out americas ability to aid the cause of freedom the left in 1975 and 1976 now turned to gutting the central intelligence agency during this period soviet mig23s went to cuba but were nonchalantly explained away by the left as insignificant a soviet training brigade in cuba in explicit violation of the 1962 agreement was explained away by the left as immaterial now the communist threat in nicaragua is explained away by the left again and again new excuses are found as the left avoided the reality of communism the soviet empire and the danger to american survival by the 1979 fullscale invasion of afghanistan by the red army the free world had lost this phase and the bipartisan anticommunist consensus had collapsed the third phase in the struggle between the soviet empire and freedom began in late 1979 the american people were shocked by the iranian hostage crisis the boldness of khomeini and qadhafi as antiamerican revolutionaries startled the nation the growing soviet presence in cuba the continued soviet military buildup and growing american weakness slowly sank into the national psyche by early 1980 the american nation was moving toward an active assertive anticommunist antiterrorist foreign policy the first reactions were a reflection of how weak and ineffective the democratic mcgovernite left wing had made americas defense intelligence and diplomatic efforts the failure of the desert i commando raid was symptomatic of the utter lack of american capability our intelligence services were weak in iran libya nicaragua grenada and elsewhere because the american left had weakened them although the carter grain embargo hurt iowa farmers it did nothing to stop soviet forces invading afghanistan while the democratic left dominated key senate and house committees and had debilitated our bureaucracies president carter finally began to respond to the obvious threats to our survival his defense secretary announced defense budget increases and new weapons programs carter increased aid to el salvador and began cutting aid to the increasingly communist government of nicaragua this is the first point to really drive home about the fundamental misinformation of our friends on the left it is carter not reagan who began to move against communism in central america it is carter who finally begins to recognize that in fact the nicaraguan communists are antiamerican bad people allied with the soviets and the cubans it is carter who begins to help el salvador survive the american peoples rediscovery of the communist threat and renewed belief that the world was dangerous helped elect ronald reagan that same rejuvenated awareness led to the defeat of a generation of leftwing senators in the 1980 election during the last 6 years president reagan has worked at developing an active anticommunist foreign policy despite a large military buildup the liberation of grenada and limited success in central america the reagan administration has not created the necessary consensus and understanding of this policy in congress or the bureaucracy there are seven reasons the reagan administration has failed to achieve its foreign policy goals first the administration has not clearly stated its vision in clear language that defines and describes reality a change from the passive mcgovernite approach of the 1960s and 1970s to an active profreedom strategy must begin with a clear vision second it has not developed an explanation ensuring continuity of public awareness and learning if the soviet empires transnational challenge is as great as president reagans occasional speeches imply then educating the american people and creating a new consensus is a fulltime job the very absence of focus and continuity reassures many americans that this debate doesnt require their attention third this vision level shift from mcgovernite passivism to reaganite activism has not occurred in the nations news media and educated leadership these groups must understand the vision before they can help educate the country at large and eventually the congress the reagan administration has followed precisely the opposite formula for 5 years in its efforts to appease potentially sympathetic senators and congressmen who are under pressure from the extreme mcgovernite left this has blurred the vision trying to win tactically in a house dominated by leftwing ideologues is a formula for frustration and defeat fourth the administration has failed to recognize necessary reforms in the executive branch that must occur if it is to implement profreedom transnational strategy powerful enough to meet the soviet empires threat the current diplomatic intelligence and military systems are simply not capable of achieving president reagans goals or implementing his vision let me go back and just say for a second that it is no accident that it is taking a very long time for the defense department to fill the new assistant secretaryship which would precisely begin to fill the gap in transnational conflicts even today a year after this was originally written this remains true while reagan believes in free enterprise the agency for international development encourages bureaucratic redtape and governmentdominated liberal welfare state economics the gap between the reagan rhetoric and the reagan administration performance is huge the reagan team can only achieve their goals if they realize they face a massive job of inventing effective systems a smallscale job of finetuning an otherwise successful system simply will not work fifth the administration has not made the major changes in management of the bureaucracies that are required for success speed is vital if the policy is to be effective we can promise modern antihelicopter weapons a latin american public education campaign about the soviet empire a united nations fight against soviet and cuban colonialism and setting up radio marti type branches in africa and honduras but unless these projects are carried out rapidly they are virtually meaningless action this day was churchills theme for world war ii if reagan is to leave behind a revitalized actively anticommunist bureaucracy he must impose his will now i note again that this was written 1 year ago and if you read the tower commission report the problems have not changed sixth the administration has not accepted the fact that its vision of the soviet threat will never be accepted by the modern democratic mcgovern left we are engaged in a struggle between two very different visions of america and the world these visions are incompatible and exclusive of each other there is no compromise the democratic mcgovernite left totally rejects reagans version of reality and therefore is appalled by his proposed response to that reality a debate between two visions or worldviews is dramatically different from a debate over strategy operations and tactics the gap between reagan and the democratic left is the same as the one that existed between truman and the henry wallace progressives the two visions are so dramatically opposed that neither one can exist in a world in which the other does therefore it is not a question of a little of one and a little of the other and everything works one side will win the other side will lose frankly i am convinved that in the long run just as churchill in the thirties eventually won his argument about the nature of nazism and hitler eventually those of us who are anticommunist and antisoviet will succeed the question is how many human beings will die how many countries will become soviet colonies how many people will live in the tyranny of a secretpolice state before we finally convince the american public that the mcgovernite democratic left is simply out of touch with reality the reagan administration should actively and openly court the democrats who have committed heresy against their party and encourage active anticommunist transnational policies last year the 13 democrats who spoke in the house on the side of freedom are the leadership base for a future bipartisan consensus on active anticommunism the 46 democrats last year who voted yes on aid to the freedom fighters represent nearly onefifth of the house democrats today unfortunately this number dropped to 40 out of 262 voting if they were openly recruited by the administration to be a part of a bipartisan consensus they could survive as politicians if not their future in a party dominated by modern mcgovernites is suspect the reagan administration goal must be to define qualify and isolate the democratic mcgovernite left the softnos must be encouraged to join the active anticommunists because they cannot afford to be mcgovernites the strategy must be to divide by defining and polarizing out of that the administration can start to build a stable bipartisan and active anticommunist majority on foreign policy seventh the reagan administration is trying to carry out an enormous shift in public opinion elected officials behavior and bureaucratic effectiveness through incremental changes it is courting the very groups who have developed the democratic mcgovernite leftwing policies he opposes what it fails to understand is the fact that mcgoverite house members sought positions on the foreign af fairs committee the armed services committee and on the key appropriations subcommittees precisely to fight for their isolationist ideological world view they strongly believe in their world view and they will do everything possible to fight for their beliefs that is their right in a free society and we should commend them for the courage of their commitment but we do not have to agree with it nor appease it the political technicians in the white house keep trying to design conflict avoidance strategies for foreign policy they fall to understand the dynamics of change in american politics and government they seek a change through compromise in a situation where compromise means no change if president reagan truly wants to use his last 2 years in office to reshape the public political and government systems of american foreign policy he is going to have to fight more often and more tenaciously and do so starting from the top down theodore roosevelt franklin roosevelt and harry truman would have understood the challenge facing presii111268 dent reagan they relished a good spirited political fight because they knew political fights attract media coverage and public attention this coverage is the first step toward educating the public education is the first step toward public support public support is the key to organized political power and organized political power is the key to building a sustainable activist anticommunist coalition if no coalition is built then no success for president reagans beliefs will emerge the choice is simple the change is difficult these seven failures must be solved if the reagan administration is to achieve its foreign policy goals ultimately president reagans achievement may be measured by the survival or demise of the leftwing fantasy world view harry trumans greatest accomplishment may have been the decline of the henry wallace progressives by 1952 isolationism had become an anachronism a relic of wellmeaning but misguided fringe groups reading the march 19 and 20 1986 debate on nicaragua is proof that reagan has failed to define and isolate this eras wellmeaning but misguided fringe group as this 1986 debate and todays debate prove the modern mcgovern left is still alive and powerful their vision is consist ent their language clear and their tactics strong until it is shown that it all supports a fantasy world they are sure to keep their power it is my intention in the next couple of weeks to get real experts to study leftwing democratic statements in todays debate to get them to analyze the factual and historical errors i then intend to write each member who spoke with error and ask them to put a statement in where they were factually wrong those who do not want to change their position even when it is indicated they are factually wrong i will invite to come to the house floor with some of my colleagues to have a debate and let me explain why for just a moment people can certainly disagree about interpreting history but they should at least talk about the facts when they discuss history people can disagree about the soviet union behavior but they should at least agree on what the soviet union is there are clear facts which are systematically inaccurate when presented by leftwing democrats it is legitimate to say that while we may have different opinions we should argue off the same set of facts or there can be no true dialog"]], "top_incorrect": [[1.0,

established in 1942 and was used by the army to manufacture and dispose of chemical weapons such as nerve gas the army also leased a section of the arsenal grounds to a private company to manufacture pesticides the arsenal which has been placed on superfunds national priority list is considered one of the most toxic parcels of land in the world it is the no 1 cleanup priority for the department of defense environmental restoration program several toxic disposal basins are located on rma the 96acre basin f was used to dispose of chemical warfare agents and pesticides between 1957 and 1980 this basin which is surrounded by a tall fence contains chemicals considered so toxic that devices are in place to prevent birds from landing on the pool in december 1971 the land family purchased 75 acres of land in adams county co approximately 1 mile north of rma ground water from rma flows in a northnorthwest direction mr land has indicated to the army that his family and his cattle have suffered severe health problems since they moved their ranching operations to the area north of the arsenal the lands claim that both the family members and their livestock suffered neurological disorders eventually half of mr lands calves developed symptoms similar to pneumonia and died the surviving cattle suffered teeth damage and did not mature the lands hired a veterinarian who conducted water and diet tests on the cattle and concluded the sickness was caused by poison in the water during the 1970s the army denied responsibility indicating that the contamination was not emanating from rma on october 6 1976 the army sent a letter regarding mr lands claims to the lands attorney samuel l mcclaren the army indicated that no pollution to the area occurred due to government activities the armys 1976 letter was sent several years after the colorado department of health outside the rma boundaries after the cdhs december 1974 and january 1975 tests indicated the presence of cdpd the army notified cdh that tests taken in the summer of 1974 showed signs of diisopropylmethylphosphonate has seeped frun rma into the ground water emanating from the arsenal epa has further determined that rma is the sole source of contamination to the north of 80th avenue and rma the lands property was located within this identified area because the water in south adams county has been contaminated the army has provided 13 5 million to treat south adams county water and sanitation districts water homes located above 80th avenue which previously had drawn their drinking water from wells now have been hooked up to sacwsd facilities the lands attorney indicates that the army had administratively denied the lands case and that the lands have exhausted their ad ministrative remedies their counsel

energetic and politically savvy are all adjectives that i have heard time and again in describing sala and her efforts that she is loved by her colleagues in the california delegation goes without saying and is illustrated by their moving statements here today and on in an earlier special order sala however was also deeply respected and admired by members on both sides of the aisle from all the 50 states she was as fine a human being as she was a lawmaker i had the opportunity to work with sala on our house select committee on hunger where we both served she and i also had an opportunity to work together on many human rights issues as a refugee from poland and a survivor of the nazi holocaust in europe salas fierce commitment to the preservation of human rights and civil rights was especially poignant to me sala was dedicated to the public service and to contributing to improving the quality of life long before she ever became a congressperson 3 years ago anyone who knew her late husband phil knew sala she was involved as heavily in california politics as were her husband and his brother john when phil passed away sala won his seat with ease and served the remainder of that term and won another term based on her fine abilities and skills as a legislator and as a public servant and not just her name we will all miss sala burton i for one will miss her graciousness

amendment to provide humanitarian aid to the nicaraguan democratic resistance and economic incentives to the sandinista government to negotiate a peaceful settlement with them this measure also authorizes funds for the contadora peace process and urges the president to resume bilateral talks with the nicaraguan government and to persuade other central american nations to join with the united states in using economic sanctions to pressure the nicaraguan government into changing its policies the single greatest issue in determining this nations policy toward the situation in nicaragua is whether or not we are willing to accept the establishment of another marxistleninist beachheadlike cubain the western hemisphere to fail to recognize the threat the sandinista government poses to the security of central america and the united states is to bury our heads in the sand the head of our own intelligence agency bill casey tells us that since 1979 when the sandinistas seized control over the government they have developed the best equipped military in the region he estimates the sandinistas have 6 000 to 7 500 cuban advisers and another several hundred other communists from the soviet union and eastern european soviet bloc countries to assist in their military buildup and consolidation of power if we allow the soviets and cubans to develop this powerful beachhead in central america and that ferment spreads our nation will know a security threat that we cannot abide clearly there is only one choice consistent with our national security and foreign policy objectives we must apply pressure from all possible sources to make the sandinistas call a ceasefire and come to the negotiating table with the democratic resistance known as the contras this will be especially difficult at a time when nicaraguas conversion to a marxistleninists state is 80percent complete they are already suppressing the press and expelling those not on their side they are arresting and imprisoning political opponents they are exporting communism to other countries they are tightening down more on the private sector and the evidence goes on down the line that the sandinistas are crs426 intent on following everything cuba has done it is also an unfortunate political reality that marxist governments do not revert to democratic forms of government not one of the some 21 countries that have gone communist have been reversed in nicaragua however there is somewhat of a unique situation a grassroots resistance movement is fighting for a democratic form of government and the same kinds of freedoms this country enjoys but the leaders of the democratic resistance emphasize shortages of food medicine and clothing which severely impede their ability to successfully wage their fight by passing the michel amendment we can encourage and help the democratic resistance continue and bestow legitimacy on their efforts thus we would send a clear message to the sandinistas and to neighboring countries whose borders have been violated that we intend to protect the freedoms and the democratic form of government in this hemisphere if we are going to provide aidhumanitarian or otherto the contras we had better do it now and in a fashion that doesnt slowly bleed them to death and diminish the strongest incentive for the sandinistas to negotiate there are those critics who charge any support for the democratic resistance will result in the united states entering the war in nicaragua with our own military forces the president himself has clearly told us his administration does not seek the military overthrow of the sandinista government or to replace it with supporters of the old somoza regime we certainly dont want another vietnam on our hands we certainly must never again get into a situation that we dont intend to win but whether or not this country would ever have to make the tough decision of military intervention is not the issue at this time lets first utilize all the peaceful means that are available through the michel amendment to try to accomplish our objective of preventing another marxistleninist beachhead we better not keep sticking our heads in the sand and say the situation in nicaragua will go away by itself because that simply will not happen its a lot easier to pay for peace now by helping those grassroots resistance forces who want freedom for themselves and are willing to fight for it than to pay for war with our own blood on a far larger scale once that beachhead has grown into a monstrous threat

was that the united states was the only western country that allowed foreign companies to make bids on transmitters interestingly enough in one case that developed it was only when the chairman offered the language and it was included in the authorization did this country begin to pay attention to the fact that there were american firms manufacturing transmitters and should be allowed into the bidding process in germany there was a case for example where they were leasing facilities to the voa as part of the modernization program but the united states was successful in including a clause in that agreement that said to the extent permitted by the laws and regulations of the federal republic of germany united states firms shall be permitted to compete for the provision of services and or equipment in carrying out the modernization and expansion program here under but when the actual contracts were issued the german government sole sourced that bid to a german firm there was never even a competitive bid so it disallowed any american firm from participating in that bidding process and therefore we were prohibited from offering a bid in april the german government recognized that it had violated that agreement with the united states and said that american firms could compete in the future unfortunately the german government has no current plans for any
