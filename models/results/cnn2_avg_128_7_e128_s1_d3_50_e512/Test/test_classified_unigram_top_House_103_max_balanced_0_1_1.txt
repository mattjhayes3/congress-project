much worse the federal debt is so bad that 1 out of every 5 that the american taxpayer sends to washington goes for nothing but interest payments on a national debt and now the democrats in this

understand that under this bill the democrats will increase taxes on your social security benefits the democrats will tax social security and will tax social security benefits because the democrats in

be turning over in his grave one hundred and thirtytwo years ago today he signed into law the nations first income taxdesigned as a temporary emergency measure to finance the civil war today president clinton is raising taxes to finance his version of a class war of course the administration is not without admirers one master of illusion the great houdini must be smiling down on this chamber today when we blow away the smoke and shatter the mirrors what we get from president clintons taxandspend road show is nowhere near what he claims not the 496 billion in deficit reduction not if we use the cbo numbers because cbo based on their estimates would score it at best at 428 billion in deficit reduction even that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of slower spending growth 4 or 5 years from now and then that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of lower spending in the fourth and fifth years this is the president who said we have all got to use congressional budget office estimates they are the real estimates and we have got to reject accounting gimmicks then he ignored cbos baselines and had his bookkeepers invent their own and counted savings from the 1990 budget agreement twice in order to puff up his deficit reduction numbers and i do not know if that is smoke and mirrors or what but if an accountant on main street did it he probably would go to jail that fact is this package includes about 120 billion in promises of net spending reductions almost all in the third fourth and fifth year 255 billion dollars worth of real net new taxes and user fees and about 53 billion in questionable debt service claims that is what you get when you lay this package against cbos estimates instead of the ones the administration cooked up there will be no net spending cuts in the first year zero and virtually none in the second year this package includes deficit increasing items totaling 62 billion over 5 years this new spending probably seems odd to the american people in a socalled deficit reduction package it is one of the reasons why they are nervous about this bill the largest tax increase in our nations history yes the largest by cbo estimates new taxes in this bill are 275 billion the democrats dispute this and they talk about the 1982 tax act but the cbo scored the 1982 tax act as raising 3214 billion in new taxes instinctively americans know these new tax increases are jobkilling poison for the economy they do not believe for one minute that the democrats tax increases are going to create jobs nor do most of the economists in this country the president claims the vast majority of these taxes will hurt only the rich and that is baloney he must not have read his own bill the socalled rich who are targets for massive retroactive tax increases are the small business men and women who create the vast majority of new jobs heaping higher taxes on those jobs creators translates into fewer jobs for working people perhaps we should remember the socalled luxury tax from the 1990 budget deal it is repealed in this bill because that misguided class warfare scheme backfired and killed the boatbuilding industry try to sock the rich and you drown working men and women simplistic attempts to minimize the impact of the energy tax on american families will not hold water either when the democrats tax transportation they are not just taxing people who pull up to the gas pump they are taxing everything that has to be transported senior citizens are among the hardest hit in this package thanks in particular to increased taxes on their benefits it must make them feel real special to learn that president clintons definition of rich people includes seniors with incomes of just 34 000 and that includes half of their social security benefits now that sounds pretty callous especially since seniors on fixed incomes are the one group of americans for whom lower interest rates serve as a financial curse rather than a blessing yes president clinton would like the american people to believe his own taxes only hurt rich people but with over 40 tax increases and 16 user fees in this package no one should seriously buy that story here is what the taxpayers do understand when he was courting their vote clinton promised the middle class a tax cut now he is raising their taxes he promised to create jobs now he is promising tax increases on employers that will kill jobs he promised 500 billion in deficit reduction he is at least 73 billion short of that at best all of the rate increases in the bill including estate taxes are retroactive to january 1 potentially unconstitutional and the installment payments gimmick for individuals does not change the bottom line he is

recently that anyone attempting to rely on president clintons longrange budget forecasts should remember george bernard shaws famous quip about second marriages the triumph of hope over experience while i heartily applaud the presidents emphasis on deficit reduction like the famous irish writer i urge my colleagues to focus on experience the problem is the underlying principles of the clinton plan that tax increases will reduce the deficit flies in the face of precedent recent history shows higher taxes lead to more federal spending lower economic growth fewer jobs and ultimately larger deficits we saw budget agreements and this chart reflects those budget agreements that resulted in massive tax increases in 1983 1985 1988 and 1990 in each case you can see from the charts more spending and larger deficits resulted from those tax increases chairman obeys own chart showed us that it was only in the years when congress was forced to restrain spending under the grammrudman act did we see any slowdown in this pace of runaway federal spending and that is reflected in chairman obeys own chart that he has presented us under grammrudman total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 1 1 percent under the 1990 budget agreement with its supposedly stricter than grammrudman spending controls total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 8 4 percent the proof is in the pudding as you can see from this chart here the grammrudman record clearly shows that seriously restraining congress ability to spend is the only real way to achieve progress on the deficit in addition i think it is important to point out actual tax revenues since the 1990 budget deal have fallen by more than 3 25 for every dollar the deal is supposed to raise and the deficit increased from 3 1 percent of gnp in 1990 to 5 percent in 1992 every economic study you look at shows that every dollar in new taxes raised since 1947 has led to 1 59 in new government spending a recent study by citizens agonst government waste showed that the 1990 budget agreement produced 2 37 in new spending for every dollar raised in new taxes that is hardly a formula for real deficit reduction experience shows that excessive government spending not a lack of tax revenues causes massive deficits revenues to the federal government have remained steady at an average of 18 6 percent of gross domestic product between 1965 and 1992 never falling below 17 5 percent at the same time government spending has risen from 17 6 percent of gnp to 23 5 percent in 1992 even more telling tax revenues have grown annually at an 8 percent rate over the past decade but spending has increased at an annual rate of 11 percent during the same time the clinton plan is more of the same with deficits the administration projected to average 250 billion a year and their analysis does not even reflect the blow to the economy of taking 328 billion out of the private sector out of the revenue stream in new taxes 328 billion these new taxes will stifle economic growth destroy jobs reduce revenues and increase the deficit economists across the ideological spectrum are convinced that the clinton tax increases will lead to widespread job loss let us look at a few of their comments david resler of nomura securities puts the cost at 400 000 lost jobs by the end of 1994 from these new tax increases drimcgraw hill says 700 000 jobs will be lost in 1997 and 1998 larry kudlow the chief economist at bear stearns estimates job losses at 3 2 million by 1996 and a reduction in real economic output of 450 billion we are going to have unfortunately i think the votes are there for the huge tax increases and we are going to see the prophecies of these economists realized constricting the economy with higher taxes not only means additional job losses less revenues from taxes higher expenditures for unemployment claims but ultimately larger deficits we all remember the infamous boat tax hike in the 1990 budget agreement that illconceived and shortsighted proposal not only failed to reduce the deficit despite the claims from many that it would do just that but it actually lost revenue the boat tax actually lost revenue because it threw thousands of workers out of their jobs as we now know the government lost the income tax revenues from these workers and increased spending on their unemployment claims the experiences of economies across the globe show that higher taxes and more government lead to longterm economic sluggishness we simply cannot grow the government without seriously stifling the private sector at the same time that the government gets bigger these tax increases stifle the productive private sector and destroy jobs we will not balance the budget or even make a dent in the deficit unless we allow the private sector to operate as the engine of economic growth i hope we can learn something from these economic lessons learned throughout our history economic lessons learned in couptries from mexico to poland but unfortunately lost on many of the politicians in this body when will they learn that free markets less government spending and low taxes are the only solid foundation for real economic growth 1 i urge my colleagues to support real deficit reduction through spending cuts not tax increases"], [2.135101931344252e-05, 2.135101931344252e-05, 0, "i want to

democrat majority first pressed for a task force to investigate these charges i said the majority is offering an unacceptable resolution for an unnecessary investigation into unbelievable allegations based on unsubstantiated claims made by unsavory characters now after an 8month investigatlon at a cost to the taxpayers of 4 5 rrlion the october surprise task force conclusively refuted all alegations nde by the proponerls of 1he october surprise conspiracy theory i hate to tell you i told you so but i told you so i belileve now and i have always beleved that thi investigation was not necessary we were told by th majority tvhi there were trowbing llegations those allgatons were not troubling there were preposterous both newsweek and the new republic concluded as much in detailed investigative reports before the democrats even started this committee there is a curious aliceinwondarend logic about all of this first there were a number of october surprise conspiracy theories reported in the media these theories fed off each other repealing the same myths and fentasles in different ways taking unproven assertions and claiming they were undeniable facts quoting dubious sources playing up anything that could damage the reagan campaign team playing down anything that would damage their own case al the sordid ancient ticks of the conspiracy trade but simply by being reported and commented upon in the politcay correct media outlets ihat is the new york tames public television et cetera the conspiracy theories were said by democrats to raihe questions that needed to be answered once that claim was made it was inevitable that a congress dominated by democrats would be asked to provide the answers particularly since it was the antirepublican conspiracy theorists themselves who primarily did the asdng so the house had a costy investigaton based on nothing more than the claim that questions had been raised but questions are raised all the time in the media theories about secret powerful cabals of sinister puppet masters abound why was this particular theory dragged out for so long in the press paid such respectful attention and finally made the subject of two congressional investigations the fact that the questions were raised by disgruntled democratic party partisans shady characters and worldclass international liars was rarely mentioned by democrats when democrats were accused by republicans of partisanship in asking for an investigation based on unproven allegations they held up their hands in pious horror and exclaimed but questions have been raised we must investigate as if they rush to answer all conspiracy theory questions as matter of principle shorn of its sensationalism here is what happened reaganhating political activists and scoundrels concocted a libelous story claiming that ronald reagan or his aides or both deliberately used the hostages for their own political purposes the media reported the story and gave the theorists forums from which to spread the ibel because the story had been reported democrats said there are questions that must be answered and a congressional investigatory committee was formed and funded the theories were as i have said groundless is this going to be the investigative model for our future in the house will the democratic leadership always call for an investigation of conspiracy theories no manner what the source so long as questions are raised will we see democrats rushing to the floor or secretly enlisting the gao to investigate conspiracy theories about president clinton if and when such theories appear if some disgruntled republican who served in the bush administration manages to get a large part of the oped page given to him of the new york times as mr sick dkto offer a wacko conspiracy theory about the president clinton will democrats say questions have been ralsedl and call for an investigation i watch and wait with patient expectation it is also interesting to note the timing of the release of the report i can guarantee you one thing if there had been one bit of evidence that the reaganbush campaign was indeed involved the information would have been on every front page across the nation before the election instead the report concluded that there was no credible evidence of a conspiracy and it was released following the election i commend mr hamilton the very distinguished member from indiana who did a fine job in leading this investigation but lee hamilton should not be forced to waste his valuable time tracking down erroneous outrageous ridiculous allegations he should spend his time on the substantive things he does best things like heading a task force on congressional reform in fact investigations like this should be an item for the joint committee on the organization of the congress we should have better procedures in the house so that we can make certain that we dont form committees to investigate every wild conspiracy theory that hits the halls of congress we should also have a requirement that the minority is always kept informed of gao investigations initiated by the majority we should also prohibit staff from writing to federal judges urging them to release convicted felons from prisons because they proved helpful with secret investigations i appreciate the role that henry hyde both as the republican leader of this task force and as a force for reason during the entire debate i would like to thank him for reminding us all through this special order that the october surprise task force was formed not because the majority wanted to answer troubling questions from credible sources but because there are some who want to cast a shadow on one of the greatest presidents in our history i

motion to instruct unfortunately this motion is the only way that the members of this body can be given an opportunity to cast a vote directly on the most unfair provision in the entire clinton proposalthe increase in taxes on social security recipients when the budget was considered in this body last week we were not given an opportunity to vote on the social security tax our hands were tied the budget was considered under a gag rule which prevented us from considering any amendments of this nature but this motion gives each of us an opportunity to vote and speak out for basic fairness for social security recipients i do not like the presidents tax package i dont believe raising taxes is the answer i think the energy tax is bad policycounterproductive policy the waterway user fee increase is definitely bad policy but one of the tax proposals in the presidents proposal stands out above all the otfiers when it comes to unfairness and dishonesty and that is the presidents proposal to raise from 50 to 85 percent the portion of social security benefits that is taxable we are not talking about wealthy people here we are talking about individuals with incomes over u5 00 couples over 32 000 we are talking about people who managed to scrimp and save and put enough money away for his or her retirement years to have a modest income it is a retirement planning pen alty some people have criticized the presidents tax plan because it breaks his promise not to raise taxes on middle class america generally they point to the energy taxthe btu taxas the culprit because that tax is passed on to every consumer and every homeowner in the country but the proposal to raise taxes on social security benefits is the real broken promise the administration fudged their numbers enough to be able to say that 70 percent of the increased tax burden would fall on people with incomes over 9100 000 but 70 percent of the increased revenue from the social security tax increase falls on people with incomes well under 100 000 the presidents tax plan singled out millionaries people with incomes over 5250 000for that special 10percent tax surcharge but the social security tax increase does exactly the same for many people with incomes between 25 000 and 32 000 many of these middieclass retired folks will be hit with tax increases over 10 percent theyre not millionaires they arent even wealthy by most standards but many social security recipients will be hit with 10 ii 12 even 13percent increases in their overall tax liability because of this proposal that is a crime but it gets worse over and above the outrageous inequity of this kind of tax increase for the elderly there is another big problem with the social security tax increase not only does it penalize savings and investment it also breaks a sacred promise to social security recipients when the tax on social security benefits was enacted in 1983 the revenues were directed to the social security trust fund to insure its future solvency that was the purpose of the taxto keep the social security trust fund strong the administrations proposal does not do that the presidents proposal would divert the additional revenues to other measures we are talking about an outright raid on the social security trust fund the presidents proposal to increase taxes on social security benefits is an outrageous breach of faith to social security and senior citizens colleagues the social security tax increase is not only bad policy it is a broken promise and breach of faith we did not get an up

deficit reduction plan that will reduce the deficitone that will cut spending and increase jobs in america a couple weeks ago i sent out a constituent newsletter to the people of the fourth congressional district as you might expect a good part of that newsletter was dedicated to the presidents tax bill and the reasons i felt it was bad for the country and the reasons why i opposed it in the original draft of the newsletter i made a couple lighthearted jabs at the presidents tax bill i mentioned that opposition to the bill was growing as more people learned more about it i said people started realizing that bill clintons economic plan is a lot like his haircutits much more vxpensive than it looks i also mentioned that the presidents btu tax was a technical energy termit stands for bill tricked you neither of those remarks was in the final version of my constituent newsletter they were both censored out by the house franking commission the franking commission would not approve the newsletter until i removed these two remarks they said they were too partisan but if this bill passes today and if you vote for this bill today you will not be able to hide behind smoke or mirrors and you will not be able to censor out the truth the btu tax was dropped in conference that is one of the few good things that did happen there but if you vote for this bill today the term btu still applies bill tricked you this is not what bill clinton promised in the election this is not what the american people voted for last november this is nnt even what bill clinton said it was tuesday night in his oval office fireside chat he is smooth and he is slick and he is a great teleprompter performer but regardless of how convincing the president may be this bill is still taxandspend pure and simple it will not cut the deficit it will not create jobs and it will not cut spending and no matter what you say you are not going to be able to hide the tax increases in this bill from the american zeople come next april 15 we treat criminals better than this bill treats taxpayers at least criminals are protected by the constitution from laws passed ex post facto you cannot make an act a crime retroactively and punish someone for it this bill punishes taxpayers for success after the fact all the way back to its amazing a lot of presidents have raised a lot of taxes but mr clinton is the first one who has managed to raise taxes before he was even sworn into office the clinton tax increases that we are voting on today actually go back and raise peoples taxes on income earned before mr clinton was even president i guess we should consider ourselves fortunate he could have made it retroactive even more and tried to tax the money people made when people were still making moneyduring the reagan years before the 1990 tax increase you can run and you can hide but even death is no protection against mr clintons appetite for new taxes like grave robbers in the night this bill raises the estate taxes on people who had the misfortune of dying since january it rips open the coffin and steals the silver dollars from the eyes of the dearly deceased if that is not punitive taxation i dont know what is i am not touching that grave diggers shovel you can hide behind the presidents assurances that this bill only taxes the rich but what about the jobs it destroys do you really think that small businesses the real job creators in this country are going to be able to expand and aire at the same time they are trying to come up with the money to pay their retroactive tax liability most small businesses partnerships and s corporations are taxed as individual income taxpayers and yes some of them are successful enough to be in the category that mr clinton calls the rich they are the folks who do the hiring and growing and who create 80 percent or more of the new jobs in this country by plowing their profits back into their business but if this tax bill passes small business wont be plowing back much they will be paying up new jobsdo not count on it the president is definitely right about one thing the people who do not get those new jobs which are not created because of his tax bill they definitely will not be paying higher taxes they will be unemployed retroactive taxation is not the only inequity here look at the taxes on senior citizens they are not richat least most of them six million social security households are going to be hit with the largest tax increase in the entire bill by having 85 percent of their social security benefits taxed rather than 50 percent the number will go up to 8 million by 1998 and higher every year after as inflation pushes more and more social security recipients over the threshold some 40 000 households in kentucky will be paying 32 million more in taxes because of this one provision and we arent talking about people with incomes over that magic 180 000 level that the president keeps using 57 percent of the taxes generated by the elderly surcharge will come from seniors with incomes under 75 000 even if you hold your nose long enough to get past the punitive retroactive tax increases and elderly surcharges in the bill you are left with one simple factthis bill just will not work it will not reduce the deficit tax increases wont reduce the federal deficit congress has proven this over and over again every time this body raises taxes it just turns around and raises spendings gimmicks like the presidents deficit reduction trust fund will not change that reality the promised spending cuts will not materialize and i have never seen a single economic model which even begins to suggest that you can create prosperity with tax increases it just cannot be done i ask you all to listen to the people for a minute they are sayingand they have been sayingcut spending first this bill does not do that it doesnt cut spending today it raises taxes yesterday it raises taxes today it raises taxes tomorrow but when it comes to spending cuts it only promises it only promises cuts some place down the road at some far off tomorrowa tomorrow that probably will never come we have heard those promises before we heard them in 1990 the taxes are still here but the promised budget cuts never came when i say there are no budget cuts in the bill i am of course speaking in relative terms there are some budget cutsthey are few and far betweenbut even these are phoney and temporary the presidents bill takes a token slap at federal employees cutting manning levels and freezing pay it slashes defense and it cuts reimbursements to doctors and hospitals but the only realistic way to cut federal employment costs over the long run is to improve efficiency or to cut the size of the federal government and to eliminate unnecessary programs as long as the federal government keeps growing we are going to need good qualified people to run those programs temporary employee cutbacks and pay freezes wont do the job but the presidents program doesnt cut back the growth of the government and it doesnt eliminate a single federal program the president does propose slashing defense spending in fact he plans to decimate national defense by cutting 127 billion but is that realistic i dont think so if he tries to cut that much some place along the line he is going to discover he doesnt even have enough aircraft carriers left for photo opportunities if he cuts as much as he proposes from national defense mr clinton is even going to have to ask mike dukakis to return the tank he used in the 1988 campaign and of course i think everybodyif they tell the truthrealizes we cant keep cutting the reimbursement for doctors and hospitals without destroying the quality of health care the savings arent real anyway the costs are just shifted out of the governments budget into the private sector so even the few cuts that are included in the presidents plan are phoney or temporary at best so overall the presidents plan was not improved very much in the conference process it is still a taxandspend bill the cuts are few what cuts there are are phoney and the taxes are very

are going up with the clinton budget we are considering today but the worst things about it are what things are going down i want to bring my colleagues attention to both the ups and the downs of the socalled plan needless to say spending is up despite omb director leon panettas comments earlier this year that the administrations budget would contain 2 in spending for every 1 in new taxes this reconciliation bill reverses this plan it actually contains 6 in taxes and fees for every 1 in spending reductions and it is a 20toi ratio over the first 2 years call me a cynic but that is more in line with what some of us expected indeed whether spending reductions will ever occur is open to question but one thing is clear the president and the majority democrats in congress are interested only in paying lip service to spending cuts in its exhaustive search for domestic programs that dont work and are no longer needed the administration came up with only 11 programs totaling less than 3 billion out of the 1 427 trillion in nondefense outlays in 1997 and of the 343 billion this bill contains in reconciled reductions less than 70 billion is not arrived at by higher taxes overall this budget adds nearly 38 billion in new or expanded entitlement programs which have after all been the problem with this budget all along while the administration has been forced into negotiating with congress over entitlement caps little has been said about the entitlement programs the budget creates even though halt a dozen human resources provisions were cut by 1 2 billion over 5 years incredibly 20 other programs were expanded by 1 9 billion creating a spending increase of 700 million so what did the ways and means committee do characteristically it added new taxes including extending the federal unemployment tax which now enjoys permanent status as a temporary tax only in washington the new immunization program is a good example of how the democrats pass up opportunities to reform social services and simply resort to throwing dollars at problems despite evidence that govemmentprovided immunizations will have no impact on the immunization rate the democrats passed on a republican plan to allow states to use rewards and punishments to encourage welfare recipients to immunize their children thereby adding another 2 billion to cost of this bill there is not even a pretense that the regressive energy tax portion of this tax bill will not be used for more spending the white house has stated that the energy tax will help reduce the deficit and put the government on a payasyougo basis for needed public programs thats more spending folks and itis interesting to see how the democrats have tried to hide the taxs regressivity by robbing one class of taxpayers to pay off another this budget spends at least onehalf of the 71 5 billion expected to be raised over 5 years on lowincome families and individuals including printed on recycled paper containing 100 post consumer waste h 2998 c a 28 billion increase in the earned income tax credit eitc 7 billion in additional food stamp payments and 1 billion for lowincome home energy assistance program payments this forces middleincome familieshardly our nations richest taxpayersto pay an excessive share of the administrations revenue goal and as the energy tax increases yearly it is impossible for the middle class to know the size of the bag it is left holding it truly is a stealth tax which brings me to the next item that is up with the clinton budgettaxes all of this increased spending will require passage of the most massive tax hike in history it calls for 332 billion in tax increases over next 5 years and adding the various hidden increases the tax bite will grow even larger in later years it creates a new individual income tax rate brackets at the 36 and 39 6 percent levels which reach even lower down the income scale than now these new tax rates are supposed to raise 31 billion of the 39 billion in deficit reduction for 1994 under this plan gone at least from this reconciliation bill is all pretense of a millionaire surtax the white house no longer pretends that it is anything more than another rate bracket with millionaires defined now as those earning more than 250 000 and of course this tax is retroactive to the beginning of 1993 even families with incomes under 20 000 contrary to the presidents claims will bear the burden every time they pay their heating bills fill their gas tanks of make a purchase of almost any kind the clinton energy tax alone will cost every american family 471 a year individuals with adjusted gross incomes over 150 000 who pay estimated taxes must under the clinton budget pay 110 percent of current year taxes as next years estimated taxes to qualify for a safe harbor so individuals with no increase in income or tax liability during that year are effectually giving the government an interestfree loan this is outrageous but it is even worse for corporations even though this bill sets the maximum corporate tax rate at 35 percent large corporations which pay estimated taxes must pay a full 100 percent estimation rather than the 97 percent under current law this reduces the margin of error in computing estimated taxes and virtually assures the assessment of penalties the administration hopes to gain 2 7 billion from this unfair illusory deficit reduction provision which will only speed up the payment of corporate taxes by a few months and make a cheap profit from hardtofollow rules which are broken there is a hidden rate bracket increase in this reconciliation bill on small businesses and family farms the biggest job creators throughout the 1980s the bill would phaseout the permanent personal exemption limiting itemized deductions and removing the cap on wages subject to the health insurance tax there is also a new maximum marginal tax rate of nearly 44 percent as my colleagues know the maximum marginal tax rate currently almost 32 percentrepresents the true incentive for entrepreneurs to earn extra money so once a person pays the highest stated tax rate of 39 6 percent adds in a medicare tax for selfemployed individuals of 2 9 percent and tacks on an itemized deduction limit at about 1 2 percent tell me what is the incentive for him or her to engage in the type of economic activity our economy needs this"], [3.715873390319757e-05, 3.715873390319757e-05, 0, "this afternoon the topic of my special order will be before we raise taxes i want to emphasize theopoint that before we raise taxes we need to examine carefully every aspect of government as my colleagues know this is a city washington where the objective need to raise taxes is almost overwhelning and every time we turn around somebody has a new reason why we need to raise taxes and they always talk in sort of casual terms we need 10 billion here 15 billion there a littie consumer tax wouldnt hurt anybody 20 billi6n 30 billion there i want to suggest that we are all forgetting because of the nature of government language that this is about real money involving real families and that it is a question to go back to president clintons inaugural address of who sacrifices first and it is fine to talk about sacrifice but somehow it always turns out to be the working american the taxpaying american the retired american who sacrifices and the government bureaucracy and the government employee unions and the trial lawyers who do better and better i would suggest that this is a real test of the family budget versus the government budget and which one is more important to those of us who have been elected now we talk about a billion dollars that dulls the senses because the truth is no family budget in america is at the billiondollar level even billionaires are only down in the 50 or 100 million a year level and for normal americans 100 is a lot of money a 1 000 is an enormous amount of money as my colleagues know at 1 000 we are talking about helping our child go through college at 1 000 we are saving up for a down payment on a house or a car at 1 000 we are talking about a lot of money for most americans and at 1 million we are talking about a thousand families talking about 1 000 and when we get to 1 billion we are talking about a million families with 1 000 each so it is very important to get these discussions down to real amounts for most people 5 is real 50 is real 100 is real but 1 billion is just government and so we sort of get numb it is almost like an anesthetic when we start talking about billions of dollars we sort of forget what is really involved the decisions we will make this spring on who sacrifices on whether we decide to change the government or to change the family budget on whether the real choices need to be made back home by working americans in their homes and their businesses or whether the real changes need to be made in washington by the bureaucracies and the welfare state these go to the core of where we are at i believe there are three very large very tough questions that need to be answered before we raise taxes we need to ask first are we using the money we already have wisely enough to morally justify asking our american families for more money we need to ask second even if the system is efficient are we in fact doing what the american people want us to do with their money and third we have to ask if we want to cut the deficit is raising taxes the right answer or will a tax increase so weaken the economy that it will kill jobs cripple revenues and increase the deficit all three of these questions i think need to be answered before we raise taxes now let me start with the question are we using the money we already have wisely enough to morally justify asking other americans to take money out of their families i just want to suggest that anybody who comes to washington and watches the federal bureaucracy for a couple of days will understand that we do not have the moral right to ask american families to tighten their belts to send the money to washington anybody who has watched the frugality of a small business that carefully monitors everything it is doing in order to stay in business or who watches the family that carefully saves pennies and decides whether or not they can afford to go to a movie and whether it has to be the twilight movie that is 3 50 rather than the evening movie at 7 understands that for most americans in tight times there are real decisions about saving even a few dollars and when you come to washington or any aspect of the federal government you can see that we are nowhere near the kind of frugality we need i recently last monday did a speech entitled renewing american civilization i talked about applying five pillars of freedom quality technological advance entrepreneurial free enterprise the principles of american civilization and psychological strength let me say that three of those quality as defined by edward demming the concept of profound knowledge technological advance using technology to do things better faster for less and entrepreneurial free enterprise using the basic principles of the free enterprise system those three pillars could dramatically lower the cost of the federal government imagine for example if president clinton were to invite 5 or 6 or 8 or 10 of the top corporate downsizers to the white house people who had downsized ford downsized ibm downsized xerox people who are in the process of downsizing sears roebuck and said to them if the key is to save money in bureaucracy and if modern computers and modern information systems allow us to save money in bureaucracy what have you learned by doing it to a bureaucracy of a hundred thousand that i can now apply to a bureaucracy of 2 million what would the department of agriculture or the department of labor look like or the department of health and human services look like if we applied the same downsizing principles for that matter what will the pentagon look like if we require it to go through the same quality transformation that say the ford motor co or xerox has gone through what we know is we would have a lot fewer bureaucrats and a lot fewer offices shuffling a lot fewer papers what we know is we would be dramatically less expensive and we would be in a position to talk seriously about how much less the federal government would cost let me also suggest that when you look at what we are subsidizing in waste waste in education in places like the new york city school bureaucracy or the washington dc school bureaucracy waste in the unionized work rules of philadelphia and detroit and new york the kind of institutionalized waste of money it makes no sense there was one report last year that in philadelphia the union work rules literally required three people at the philadelphia airport to change a ltghtbulb because one person had to come and take the various lighting fixtures off a second person had to come to change the bulb and a third person had to come to sweep around the area after the first person put the light fixtures back on now we cannot afford that kind of waste in government i recently talked here about the problem of the new york city custodians who are given a brandnew jeep every 5 years by the school board and if they do not use the jeep at the end of 5 years they get to take it home as a personal vehicle and then they get a new jeep so all the alternatives in the new york city system are for nonuse of the jeep so it can become a personal vehicle with minimum miles on it and minimum waste and there was the recent custodian for the public schools in new york city who was indicted because he was sitting on his yacht when he was collecting money for supposedly cleaning up the school my point is that there is a tremendous amount of reform in local state and federal government that is needed before we raise a penny in taxes let me go a step further and suggest that precisely what made americas biggest corporations inefficient and ultimately economically insecure was their unwillingness to go through dramatic change general motors would be a healthier company today if over the last 10 or 15 years it had gone through change and sears and roebuck would be a more competitive company today if over the last 10 to 15 years it had gone through dramatic change now we see the private market forcing change at that level we see what is happening to these corporations in order to stay alive they have got to become leaner more competitive and more customer oriented yet what do we hear from the government not any talk about dramatic bold change not any talk about dramatic management reforms not any talk about downsizing the bureaucracy instead what the government says is that we really cannot change anything except in your pocketbook we cannot threaten any of the public employee unions we cannot talk about changing any of the bureaucracies we cannot think about changing the civil service laws or the personnel laws or the procurement laws all we can think about is getting more money out of working americans but before we raise taxes i think we owe it to the american people to apply the same management toughness to government that we are seeing applied throughout the private sector there is a second question we need to ask before we raise taxes even if the system is efficient and i do not believe it is or even if we went through that process of making it efficient are we in fact doing what the american people want us to do there is a very simple test of this which congressman bob walker of pennsylvania has put in the record it is a bill that would allow all taxpayers to set 10 percent of their tax aside to go directly to the debt they could set aside anything from 0 up to 10 percent let us say you paid 3 000 in federal taxes under the walker proposal you could designate anything from 0 up to 300 to go to the federal debt and the congress would receive an instruction to lower federal spending by the same number of dollars the congressional budget office suggested that congressman walkers bill would probably balance the budget within 5 years based on public opinion polls of how many people would be using the 10 percent deficitcutting mechanism but notice what it says it says that you do not have to pay for any more government that you think is wasteful or that you think is not useful it says that you could make decisions to force the congress to cut the size of the aggregate federal government i think that is a very useful idea and a better idea than raising taxes so one of the things we ought to look at is before we get around to tax increases before we raise taxes passing congressman walkers 10percent deficit setaside to allow the american people to vote by their pocketbooks on how much of their taxes up to 10 percent could go to reducing the deficit and forcing the government to set priorities let me carry it a step further what if we were to set priorities what if we were to say to the american people here are the 30 least important bureaucracies in washington could we close them down what if we were to say here are the 20 least important programs not that they are not good programs if you have a milliondollarayear income it is amazing what you can do that you would not do if you have a 20 000ayear income you do not need as many priorities and you would not have to make nearly as many tough decisions at a million dollars a year what we have in washington is a congress and a government which has an openended idea about how much they want to spend but has a fairly limited actual amount of revenue coming in and the deficit is the gap between our unwillingness to set priorities and the size of the real revenue if we were to actually test the system here is what we would find out eightyone percent of the american people want us to replace welfare with workfare it is an astonishing number eightyone percent of the people agree that we need to require people to work if they get money that by the way would dramaticallyohange the cost of welfare yet we are hearing talk that we ought to raise taxes on working americans to subsidize the welfare system and take care of people who are not working that is something 81 percent of the people object to seventyfive percent of the american people believe we ought to have malpractice reform and tort reform so we would have fewer lawsuits and fewer gigantic settlements and so we would have less litigation that would save more than 5 billion and the estimates go on up to 30 billion or 40 billion a year it would save money oa defensive medicine it would save money in lawsuit costs it would save money in court costs and it would save money across the board in terms of not having to pay professionals to do extra things just to be prepared to defend ourselves we ought to pass malpractice and tort reform before we talk about raising taxes then we come to an area where people do not want change and yet it is one of the areas that the democratic administration is talking about changing i am fascinated by this this is a wire story which was brought to my attention just a few minutes ago it talks about president clintons economic aides and i want to share this with my colleagues this is an associated press story in the first word of what clintons longdiscussed proposal will look like clintons aides said the presidents package would consist of 16 billion in immediate spending increases for fiscal 1993 which runs through sept 30 in addition the package will contain 15 billion worth of investment tax credits a tax break given businesses that invest in equipment there is no word in that story about any offsets this is a 31 billion increase in the deficit we remember that ross perot ran promising to cut the deficit and bill clinton ran promising to cut the deficit he was going to cut the deficit in half in his first 4 years the first proposal we are now hearing is a 31 billion increase in the deficit if my memory serves me that is around a 9percent increase on the current total deficit projection so we are going to actually increase the deficit on the way to decreasing the deficit does that not sound like something we have all lived through before where the politicians promise anything to get elected and then rapidly begin to figure how they are not going to do any of the things they promised we notice also that the new term in washington is investment investment has replaced pork barrel it is a good washington word and people who love big government and love the welfare state believe if they run around chanting investment long enough people will not notice that investment is just a new word for spending the article goes on to say thisand i am quoting from the associated press story that came over the wire a few minutes agothe administration officials spoke of a raft of upperincome taxes that arwe under consideration the official said in addition panetta spoke of the need for a shared burden in deficit reduction the off icial said although he did not specify what he meant the former house budget committee chairman has been an advocate of finding savings in the social security program panetta has been a supporter of one proposal under consideration the elimination of next years costofliving increase for the nations 41 million social security recipients the article goes on to say this also under consideration is a plan cc tncrease the amount of taxes social security recipients would have to pay on their benefits many senate democrats prefer that alternative since only the v4 bestoff retirees pay any taxes at all now notice this what are they talking about here when they talk about the concept of shared burden in deficit reduction now this is the democratic office of management and budget the director of the budget shared burden does not mean cutting the size of government notice this is an article saying they are going to increase the size of government by 16 billion so the bureaucracy the politicians the pork barrel recipients they are not going to suffer any shared burden shared burden according to this article is going to mean people on social security paying more taxes or alternatively people on social security having to give up part of their costofliving increase or even the elimination according to this consideration of the elimination of rext years costofliving increase now let me point out the one government program people actually seem to like is social security it is the one program where grandchildren seem to think it is reasonable to pay to help their grandparents grandparents are grateful they are getting money parents are glad that they are in a situation to help their own parents who are now retired and there is a social contract which is very deeply held this is the one program also by the way which has a very tiny bureaucracy we send out more social security checks with fewer civil servants than almost any other program in the government so which program do our friends in the democratic administration want to hit social security notice also to receive social security you actually were working you were actually putting money away you were actually paying the social security tax so once again who is going to get it in the wallet it is the working american in this case it is the retired version of working americans meanwhile is government going to get smaller no according to this article the very first step that the clinton administration wants to take is to increase the size of government by 316 billion exactly the wrong step here wehave not even the usual fig leaf let us vote for a tax increase and we will have smaller government because we will cut spending by the way that fig leaf is never kept the average over the last 20 years is that for every dollar of tax increase there is a 1 58 increase in spending but that is not the key here the key here is that you have an administration which is saying let us raise spending and raise taxes now what does that mean that means less money for retirees it wreans less money in social security it means less money in the private sector it means less money for families but it means a lot more money for bureaucrats a lot more money for politicians to give away as pork barrel and a lot more money for the public employee unions to be able to organize people now i think that it is very important for the american people to understand up front exactly what is at stake here this is the first shot in what is going to be a 4year process of the democrats attempting to raise taxes on working americans and retired americans to transfer the money to politicians and bureaucrats to have a larger welfare state and a bigger welfare system it is explicitly wrong and as long as the welfare state keeps growing i think we have an absolute obligation to fight any tax increase so before we raise taxes let us overhaul the entire welfare state let me go to the third question even if we were doing the right things and we were doing them efficiently would we want to cut the deficit by raising taxes or will tax increases so weaken the economy that in fact a recession will come on jobs will be killed revenues will go down and the deficit instead of decreasing will increase now notice everywhere around the world we are telling people who are trying to make a transition from big centralized governments that they ought to decentralize we are telling boris yeltsin in russia we are telling menem in argentina salinas in mexico privatize parts of your government shrink your bureaucracy go back to the free market go back to private property and yet here in washington we have all too many people in the democratic administration who are talking about bigger government bigger bureaucracy mora programs and higher taxes i believe that that will in fact kill the current recovery and put us back in a recession it might take 1 or 2 years but it will happen it will happen first because as they increase the size of government you are going to see interest rates go back up and you are going to see the inflation rate go back up i am now prepared to predict having watched for a couple of weeks we are now very very close to the low point for both inflation and interest rates we are at a 20year low it has taken us 12 years to recover from carters inflation it took a tremendous amount of pain both in the recession of 198182 and in the recession of 199091 but finally we are at the lowest interest rates for home mortgages the lowest longterm unitedstates bond rates and the lowest inflation rate we have seen in 20 years the result we now have liberal democrats promptly promising bigger spending bigger government higher taxes which will lead to more inflation and higher interest rates and i will be very prepared a year from now or 2 years from now to come back here to the house floor and defend that projection and look at what inflation and interest rates look like at that point i feel some confidence in talking about the economy because on august 22 1990 1 spoke at the heritage foundation on a speech entitled the was ington establishment versus the american people a report from the budget i want to take page 9 of that particular speech and share with people what i said in 1990 because i think we are right back in the same situation economic dangers i believe that we have to then take this analysts and look at a very real danger which can cause all of us enormous pain and that is a recession the world that existed at the beginning of the budget summit is over i went on to talk about the seizure of kuwait and what is happening in iraq we have the fact absolute fact in my judgment that the economy is clearly weaker today than it was a year ago and i want to make a point that is not made often enough in this city a recession is the worst enemy of a balanced budget if we have a recession and we have millions of americans put out of work the net effect of not paying taxes because you dont have a job and increasing unemployment and welfare because you need it will be to dramatically widen the budget deficit but there is a second hidden whammy now and that is the cost of the savings and loan bailout the government is now the largest seller of property in america therefore it has a greater interest than any other person or group in keeping property values up because if property values crash the cost of liquidating the properties goes up astronomically avoiding a recession now given those two objective realities and combining with them a caring humanitarian view that argues that a job is the best welfare program the number one goal on september 5th when the congress returns should be to adopt a proposal which will avoid a recession and for the life of me i cannot see how any member of congress or any member of the government could argue for anything else in terms of domestic policy we must be strong in the middle east and we must be strong in the american economy i believe we should have a tax cut package because we know what doesnt work and we know what does work in the 1970s we tried raising taxes going into a recessionthis was the famous hoovercarter policy and it didnt work in the early thirties didnt work in the seventies turns out when you raise taxes going into a recession you get a depression if youre unlucky and you get a very deep recession if youre lucky we also tried a different technique in the eighties called lowering taxes lowering taxes seemed to have a better effect than raising taxes now i am not an economist or a political scientist so i dont have any kind of linear projection here but as a historian i am willing to suggest that we would rather be like the eighties than the seventies now this is in washington by the way a very radical statement im serious large parts of washington want to raise tayes precisely to repudiate the eighties this is an act of purification and liberal democrats want to be able to go home and say you see we have finally done away with all the wicked things that ronald reagan did and now youll be safe and theyll say this to very long unemployment lines let me make the point that i said this on august 22 1990 and we were discussing at that time a situation in which we were in a budget summit and all the establishment figures of washington were saying raise taxes raise taxes as we all know president bush tragically gave in we raised taxes and what was the result it was exactly what i said in august 1090 recession was deeper the unemployment was longer the deficit grew bigger government revenues declined fewer people were at work they paid fewer taxes the result was the government had less money and the net result was a bigger debt and a worse economic situation sadly the final result was the defeat of president bush who finally looked back in august 1992 and said in houston at the republican convention that in fact it had been a great mistake to raise taxes in 1990 well let me just suggest to you that this is still a great mistake this economy is much weaker than its macro numbers when you see general motors talking about laying off thousands of people when you see sears talking about laying off thousands of people when you see ibm talking about laying off thousands of people when you see additional burdens being put on small business the fact is objectively we are a very fragile economy the german economy is in trouble the japanese economy is in trouble if we have one or two unexpected shocks we are going to go back into a recession now we have a very painful very hard bought gradual slow recovery under way and any effort to increase the deficit with bigger government spending is going to raise interest rates and that is going to weaken the economy and any effort to raise taxes is going to weaken the private sector and that is going to weaken the economy and the result is going to be more people out of work yet the fact is that in washington those obvious common sense historic lessons do not seem to get through to people i made that point on page 12 in the 1990 heritage speech when i said washington against america and we need to look at this city as a city which is almost totally out of touch with the american people today a city which has rejected every presidential election since 1968 in both parties they rejected the republicans and they rejected jimmy carter and then they rejcted more republicans this is a city which is proud that it has withstood all the screams of the american people for lower taxes less government and a replacement for the welfare state i think i could say that paragraph today and include bill clinton as well as jimmy carter what did we have last fall we had a presidential campaign in which a thirdparty candidate one of the most powerful of the 20th century campaigned against the deficit said we had to cut spending in washington we had to cut the deficit and what do we see we see the very first clinton socalled stimilus package giving the politicians and the bureaucrats 16 billion in bigger deficit because they are going to spend 16 billion more in washington we have as i said in 1990 a rejection of lower taxes by the washington power structure which wants higher taxes a rejection of lees government by the washington power structure which wants more government and a rejection of the concept of replacing the welfare state where workfare is supported by 81 percent of the american people by liberal democrats who in fact favor the welfare state now in that framework let me suggest that there is a book which has been a best seller which is worth looking at by folks by harry figgle jr with gerald swanson called bankruptcy 1995 the coming collapse of america and how to stop it this is a very powerful book which talks about deficits it is a book which talks about the need to cut spending and the need to cut the deficit i want to share with you a couple of key points that mr figgle and dr swanson make in their book this is a current best seller he talks about the budget reconciliation act of 1990 this lethe act which was passed against my opposition after the speech i made at heritage in august it was a deal made in october by the power structure of the city of washington to prop up the welfare state by raising taxes on the american people this from pages 59 to 61 is what mr figgie says"], [5.836418495164253e-05, 5.836418495164253e-05, 0, "for wordng families making less than 180 000 a year there will be no income tax increase thus spoke bill clinton tuesday night in the most disingenuous speech of his recent career in truth clintons income tax increases will kick in for some families earning as little as 35 000 a year for example the clinton budget now poised for final passage in congress includes a 70percent income tax increase on the social security benefits of lowincome senior citizens if the clinton plan becomes law working social security recipients over 70 years old who earn 35 000 or as little as 22 000 of joint income per spouse will pay 70 percent more in new taxes on the social security portion of their income on the house floor i sought to eliminate the clinton income tax increases on lowincome seniors my effort was rejected in a straight partline vote in an even more obvious way president clinton fiatout fibbed when he asserted that for working families making less than 180 000 a year there will be no income tax increase the clinton tax bill increases the top rate from 31 to 38 percent for a family madng 115 000not 180 000 and for families in which both spouses work their taxes increase by 16 percent even if neither makes more than 70 000 heres another example clintons income tax increases will fall on persons in any tax bracket who have to move to a new job currently moving expenses are legitimate business costs clinton eliminates the tax deductiblilty for awayfromhome meals temporary living expenses rent and other real estate costs for a lowwage worker who makes say 25 000 a year that can mean a huge income tax increase clintons 5year tax plan also imposes a seriously unfair marriage penalty tax as a result of the clinton income tax hikes middleincome mothers and fathers who are marded to each other will be forced to pay dramatically higher income taxes than if they were not married for mary and david both schoolteachers in san diego who earn 40 000 their tax bill as a married couple

eliminating the deduction for dues is a populist political gimmick worthy of james carville at the height of his powers but for every bel air or riviera dub member it aims to punish it hurts scores of regular folks how so volunteers in kiwanis rotary lions and other service dubs who make as little as 20 000 per year will also have their income taxes raised by this particular proviskln sadly creating new disincentives for charity and voluntary community service seems to be what clinton has in mind when he preaches that all americans must share some pain when dick gephardt and dick darman got together in the 1990 budget deal to impose a popujist luxury tax on boats the boat industry left our shores did millionaires suffer pain when they flew to europe or asia to buy their new yachts of course not but boatyard workers from maine to california now suffer the pain of unemployment as a direct result of this tax by the same token drcx gephardt and leon panettas new populist tax hikes on business meals wont cause any hardship for tycoons instead laidoff minimum wage work ers cooks dishwashers waiterwill pay a 100 percent tax when they lose their jobs the clinton tax bill includes some 25 new tax increases most of which affect ordinary people who make far less than 180 000 per year none of these tax hikes curbs governments spending habits the real cause of deftcits none of these

now however its up to congress to follow the same intelligent path as it weighs the funding demands of major government programs particularly health care the reason higher beer taxes should be avoided has nothing to do with politics using such taxes to fund ongoing government programs is not smart budgeting because it simply doesnt work all we need to do is look toward the states to discover the growing inefficiencies of beer excise taxes last year the council of state governments called these socalled sin taxes a wom out tax source the council advised states to look for more stable revenues to fund vital programs such as health care and education the council is not alone in its contention that revenue for important social programs should not come from unreliable sources such as beer taxes other widely respected organizations including the federation of tax administrators and the national council of state legislators agree that the excise tax piggy bank has been raided too often the federal government should heed these omens and leave beer taxes off the table once and for all when searching for health care funding vehicles funding for any major social program especially national health care should not fall unduly upon the shoulders of beer consumers or any other single group tax fairness is a timehonored principle in our country and during the past few years responsible beer consumers have shelled out more than their fair share when the federal beer excise tax was doubled in 1991 moderate drinkersnot chronic abusers reduced their consumption not only did this prove beer taxes to be a shaky revenue generator but it also punished 84 million hardworking middle class americans whose only offense was purchasing a perfectly legal adult consumer product the minority of drinkers who abuse alcohol are not put off by higher costs they have serious problems which can only be cured through education and tougher law enforcement not excessive taxation punishing the many for the irresponsible behavior of the few is not just a bad idea its bad public policy period access to quality health care is a vital issue of our times but implementing a regressive tax to fund a program for every american doesnt jibe with common sense our task in congress is clear any health care program up for consideration must include reasonable funding mechanisms ones that do not

regulation of corporate activity we have power with respect to regulation of how they spend their advertising dollars if you want to be brave and do something about trying to influence teenage values then why not take on a greater regulation role with respect to the fcc with respect to corporate power and the kinds of things they finance why not take on a greater regulation role with respect to

the most fundamental rights protected by our constitution is the right to vote i believe we would all agree that the american peoples ability to vote must be protected nurtured and even facilitated if our political system is to be preserved in our past election 70 million or 38 percent of eligible citizens were unable to vote in the presidential election because they were unregistered this comes on the heels of the 36 percent national voter turnout in the 1990 congressional elections the lowest turnout since 1942 these alarming figures should serve as a serious warning to our nation that our constituents are becoming increasingly disenfranchised from the political process when tied to driver licensing and state ids voter registration becomes readily accessible to over 90 percent of our population and getting voters registered is the key to high voter turnout with voter registration mechanisms at state motor vehicle departments public assistance offices and disability centers supplementing our current procedures every american should have the opportunity to participate in our democratic process the most often heard explanation for why americans do not vote is that they do not register in time this bill would make the registration process virtually effortless and statistics show that even when overall voter turnout is low 80 to 90 percent of the registered voters participate in presidential elections states that have motorvoter programs have not only increased political participation but also have significantly decreased costs of registration this too is an objective that follows no party line perhaps the greatest concern raised regarding h r 2 is the potential risk of fraud through mail registration and lax listcleaning procedures the successes of existing state motorvoter programs are proof that these concerns are unfounded for example oregon has had mail registration for 17 years without a single case of fraud and minnesota and washington have had similar experiences in addition this conference report maintains and protects the integrity of our election process the legislation is anything but indifferent to the threat of fraud it provides for strong criminal penalties for fraud mandatory address verification procedures and requirements to remove from the voting rolls the names of those who have died or moved out of the

the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes

trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials

process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that

themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the

to do four ci7s instead of six c17s it increases the price per unit from 30 to 40 million third it requires the contractor to prove they can produce prove that they can produce the product on time and of the quality that is necessary in the number that is necessary to get the job done finally i would conclude by saying this dick cheney not long ago was quoted as saying the c17 is an absolutely vital strategic asset regardless of what size force we have in the long run i urge my colleagues to support the harman amendment"], [0.0004597306251525879, 0.5004597306251526, 1, "i thank the gentleman for his response i further yield to the gentleman during the time that i haveremaining in my 5 minutes"], [0.0004646778106689453, 0.500464677810669, 0, "i thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for this time i say to my colleagues that i have always supported an independent counsel bill and i was one who supported it back in 1978 when it first passed but it seems to me we should learn something from experience a mere reauthorization of the law as it has presently itood until it lapsed last december just will not cut it it indicates that we are impervious to the lessons of expeiience for example there is the matter of treatment of classified information we have heard stories about the independent counsel that investigated the irancontra controversy taking a suitcase full of classified material that was used in a deposition out on the west coast of former president reagan and tossing it to a red cap at the curb of the los angeles airport and it has never been seen again and it was not reported for many many weeks that cannot happen that should not happen there should be some accountability the chairman of our committee the gentleman from texas has thoughtfully prepared an amendment that says the independent counsel shall follow the laws and the regulations pertaining to classified material that is well and good but where is the sanction there is no sanction in my substitute which the members will get a chance to vote for it provides that if indeed the independent counsel or any of his staff do not follow the rules or regulations concerning the proper treatment of classified material they are removed we have a sanction i suggest with all deference to my chairman that his provision is toothless it has no bite we should provide a sanction effective cost controls one of the things we ought to have learned was the profligacy with which mr walsh operated his office i must say that midas never in his wildest days had the resources available to him even after everything he touched turned to gold there was absolutely no accountability no oversight as to the millions that were spent by judge walsh over a period of 7 years what we want in the substituteand that is the only place where we find this reformis that the annual appropriations process obtains after the first 2 years the independent counsel has 2 years to do whatever he or she will but after that we ask them to please submit yourself to an appropriations process we are dealing with taxpayers money the jurisdiction of an independent counsel the bill that we are asked to vote for the bill that the chairman of the committee has brought to us has nothing to say about narrowing the locus or jurisdiction of the independent counsel he doesnot have a license to go hunting in the forest and shoot every critter that moves it should be specific it should be targeted it should be directed it should be focused so that there is not this grandiose lavish expensive and reputationruining hunting expedition jurisdiction defined what is the basis for a preliminary investigation right now you can trigger the attorney generals action under the independent counsel statute the one that just lapsed and the one we are asked to reauthorize by information that there may have been a violation of federal law instead it ought to be specific information from a credible source that is finetuning and tightening up the trigger mechanism for this whole elaborate process of an independent counsel i am going to have an opportunity to offer that as a freestanding amendment and i hope that it will be supported because it makes this a more lawyerlike and a more professional and workable piece of legislation duration of an investigation does it go on and on from generation to generation to generation judge walsh served longer i think than any attorney general in history except maybe one or two i am told7 years somewhere along the line there should be some accountability so my substitute says that the court that appointed the independent counsel can terminate the independent counsel whenever the court decides that the job is done or it is in the public interest that enough is enough it would seem to me that that is a very useful amendment it also provides that if the job is not done after 2 years the independent counsel must apply for reappointment there is nothing wrong with that it just simply requires a review of the tenure the unlimited tenure that is in herent in the existing bill what about attorneys fees if you are a target and you went to trial and you were acquitted or your conviction is reversed on appeal thatis a pyrrhic victory if you are bankrupt if you have been economically devastated by the money you have had to raise to defend yourself my substitute requires payment of those attorney fees"]]}
