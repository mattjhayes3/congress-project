{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise in support of the fauntroy substitute the congressional black caucus once again has presented an alternative budget plan that offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [7.152557373046875e-07, 0.9999992847442627, 1, "first of all i would like to commend congressman wyche fowler for providing the time for this much needed discussion of a very critical issue the slaying of over 20 children in atlanta ga is clearly indicative of the sickness which is eroding the fibers of our society violence is becoming more and more a way of life throughout our nation the atlanta slayings and related attacks against children are very cogent symbols that we are moving further away from the highest regard for human life it frightens me deeply to acknowledge the significant psychological damage which is growing among all children due to the recent incidences while the victims of these murders have all been black it is no secret that such acts of violence do not discriminate the fundamental question we must face now is that any child may be forced to live in fear during every phase of a days activity surely the increased number of weaponcarrying schoolchildren momentary periods of panic if a parent is late picking up a schoolchild and decrease in academic achievement are not peculiar to the findings of several atlanta psychiatrists psychologists and mental health officials the feelings of distrust fear and apprehension wih spread among all of our nations children as they begin ti dread functioning in everyday environments this is a sad outlook for our future another fundamental question which is magnifici in the minds of those who fear for human safety is the continuing focus away from human needs we are forced now to question if whether or not the evils of poverty deprivation and unemployment may be so deep rooted in our society that respect for human life becomes secondary to mere survival we are also forced to question the validity of continuous violence as romanticized and glamourized on our television and movie screens the situations in georgia florida maryland and throughout most regions in this country leave us frustrated and angry they leave us to question the basic responsiveness of authorities who must become more adamant in the protection of human lives however they must not lead us to take the law into our own hands the widespread acts of violence must also remind us that the protection and preservation of human lives are crossjurisdictional when as many as 21 lives are lost it cannot be pegged as a state or local government matter both the president and the congress realized this and i laud the dispersal of federal funds to atlanta and the efforts to appropriate 1 5 and 1 8 million for use by this city we have to examine closely the cli mate that motivates and encourages psychotic violence the violence of racism the aforementioned influence of television and movies and the violence of war and militarismall of these inevitably get reflected in individual behavior to a greater or lesser degree he psychotic killers who murder our children in atlanta or any where else are victims of this climate and have apparently been affected to a greater degree we cannot excuse this behavior however we can and must deal squarely with the environment which fosters such actions several sociologists tell us that most of the slain atlanta children come from public housing neighborhoods which are more vulnerable and conducive to human mistreatment abduction and even death such conditions and incidences are not limited to this region of the country right here in washington d c children from lowincome housing projects are becoming more and more susceptible to conditions of drug abuse and molestation here the elimination of unemployment underemployment and poverty must precede the eradication of such criminal acts it is not easy to warn the blacks of atlanta to stay away from theories that the acts of violence against 21 black children are conspiratorial in nature or racially motivated the pattern of systematic murders rapes additional overt and covert actions against black citizens in the south and throughout this country is still just too prevalent however we must assist in the efforts of mayor maynard jackson the numerous task forces and concerned cftizens in addressing the problem in a rational way again until we eliminate the fundamental societal ills we cannot be shocked at deviant behavioral patterns of violence irresponsibility and total disregard for human lives there is little help in calling on citizens to care about each other when increasing inequities among neighborhoods schools living standards and opportunities have become a way of life those of us who are in a position to have impact on public policy must stand firm against further inequities and burdens on our children elderly and lowincome citizens we must promote the kind of solidarity which has been displayed as citizens across the nation have rallied behind the victimized atlanta families most importantly we must not be afraid to oppose and openly attack racism chronic unemployment poverty injustice and other societal ills which cloud any efforts to provide equal opportunities for each and every citizen e"],

worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax bill"], [2.7418136596679688e-06, 0.9999972581863403, 1, "i would only allude to a few comments admiral laroche of the center for defense information quoted lord mountbatten the

for deterrence but the supporting documents for this military budget fiscal year 1983 say we must have the capacity to fight to survive and win a nuclear war anyone who believes we can fight survive and win a nuclear war bydefinition with all due respect is psychotic every analyst i have seen indicates that no one wins in a nuclear war there is no such as a limited war a surgical strike where 20 to 100 million human beings are dead what is limited and surgical about that i would quote dr geiger the executive director of the physicians for social responsibility who said as i look at the united states and the soviet union and their nuclear arms race i think of two men and i think that is appropriate because it is very sexist and macho to play war gamestwo men in a room locked tight up to their throats in gasoline one standing there with 10 matches and the other standing there with 7 matches and they are both arguing over whether they need 15 matches apiece before they can agree not to strike 1 match in that room that is where we are that is precisely where this arms race is millions of the american people are beginning to awaken to the reality that nuclear war is insanity bloated wasteful and unnecessary military budgets are not in our best interests finally my colleagues are talking about a 5percent addon for fiscal year 1983 military budget as if these numbers make some sense the point is that fiscal year 1982 was an incredibly high base in fiscal year 1981 the military budget in budget authority terms was 173 billion in fiscal year 1982 it went up to 226 billion 25 percent over and above that is incredible we must remember that ronald reagan stomped us in 1982 and put the military budget at an incredible level so let me give the members these figures because it also includes the black caucus budget when you go back to 1981 as a base 1982 which was terribly out of line the jones budget if we use 1981 figures calls for 32 9percent increase in 2 years the aspin

congress who happen to be democrats but have not had the same career do not have the same commitment and we are now seeking to build a bipartisan coalition of democrats and republicans who have given up on the centralized liberal welfare state who realize that the politics of big government big spending high taxes high interest rates will destroy jobs and will put americans out of work we hope the democrats of the younger generation we hope the democrats who are not committed to the liberal welfare state we hope the democrats who understand the economic sickness of 1980 will join with us if we cannot have a compromise of leaders then let us have a compromise of members let us work together to find a budget which will put people back to work will bring down interest rates and will bring together the members of both parties in an effort to find a real solution we ask no one to switch parties although we are delighted with those who do so we ask no one to give up their traditional ties all we ask is the democrats willing to place country above partisanship look at the current economic crisis and agree to join us the type of medicine that would make america healthy is simple first keep the tax cut which on july 1 will increase the number of real dollars in americans paychecks which will give americans a better chance to go out in their neighborhood to buy a car to buy a house to make the investments and the savings that will get this country moving again second cut federal spending including some cuts in defense spending in order to bring down the deficit so that the federal government will not borrow so mqch money so that the interest rates will fall so that small business can survive so that we can go back to creating jobs in the automobile and housing industries third pass a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget that will by itself bring down interest rates as the money markets come to realize that we have in fact reached a historic watershed and that we are moving on to an era in which the government will be disciplined and in which we will have to begin balancing the budget every year that by itself passing a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget more than any single act will set the stage for the rest of the 1980s for a period of stable money low interest rates and job creation that will give all of us a chance to have real prosperity citizens who are impatient who have grown angry watching people laid off watching businesses go bankrupt or the senior politicians talk citizens can do something first they can ask their congressmen to cooperate in writing a budget that will cut taxes will cut spending will bring down borrowing will lower interest rates and will create jobs asking for cooperation a sign of putting america above partisanship is the first step second they can ask their congressman to cosponsor the conablejenkins constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget already the conablejenkins amendment has 200 cosponsors it is only 18 short of a majority it is on the way to being an acceptable constitutional amendment but it needs more help you know 2 weeks from now the budget is legally due two weeks from now if this congress were responsible we would pass a budget passing that budget is the first step toward lowering interest rates and creating jobs today i asked a senior leader of the democratic party when we would see a budget and we were given no firm date i think every citizen has the right to ask of this congress that it obey the laws it has passed that it obey the budget act arid that we produce a budget by may 15 americans are being put out of work now americans are going bankrupt now the time to act to pass a budget to pass a constitutional amendment

the budget and tax debates of last year condemning the projections of the congressional budget office poor economics they said the cbo is incompetent they said cbo is using the wrong assumptions they said dr rivlin is too liberal and ought to be replaced they said one year later we know that the cbo was right because their projections yere based on some familiarity with economics and they refused to adopt the fantasies of the alchemists at the office of management and budget they implicitly predicted this day would be faced by this congress wishing something to be mr president does not make it

cannot find ways to use such unprecedented largesse meanwhile we told the poor the elderly and the marginally employed that they were sapping the economy of its strength and it was up to them to restore it it was predictable when we cut job training assistance and based our ceilings for unemployment assistance on hallucinatory projections of the administration it was predictable and you know

of community offered to publish at its own expense situations wanted ads for detroits unemployed the response was six pages of free ads while the help wanted ads were listed on a single page our

collar less time with black tie and more with black unemployment less time talking with people in reception lines and more time talking with people in unemployment lines there is a certain vindication for those of us who stood on this floor last year and denounced the midnight budget with its disneylike assumptions who predicted severe dislocations and resulting unemployment which would in turn

circulating that the administrations task force on entitlement programs is considering further reductions to the national school lunch program i rise today to voice my strong opposition to any further cuts in this area ihave surveyed a number of school districts in my home state of missouri and have found a significant increase in the bosts of meals to paying students and a significant decline in the number of participants because of budget cuts already enacted the prices have gone up an average of 20 cents program participation ha4 dropped anywhere from 10 percent to 30 percent in general the paying student has traditionally made up 63 percent of the participating population in the school lunch program these paying students are leaving the program now at rates between 25 and 30 percent it is this loss of moneycombined with federal assistance reductionsthat threatens the very existence of many school lunch programs as we all can understand a school cafeteria has many fied costs add the rising cost of food equipment and labor and many school districts are being forced to make an unpleasant decision can we afford to feed our students if federal funds for school lunches are further reduced this administration will be pulling the safety net out from under those who are the most truly needy free meals are made available to the poorest student but if schools continue to experience a decline in paying students they may well have to close down the lunchrooms this leaves the poor student with no alternative whatsoever as a member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the national school lunch program i have written 0mb director david stockman urging him to forego any consideration of further cutbacks in this program five of my republican colleagues on the subcommittee have joined with me in this letter to put it bluntly we believe tile national school lunch program has given all it can give to our common goal of balancing the budget we have advised mr stockman that any effort to make further cuts will not have our support our side of the aisle cannot deliver the votes necessary to win further cuts from the national school lunch program so far the school districts that i have surveyed in the state of missouri have indicated that they can cope with the cuts so far enacted however they are very concerned that any further reduction in federal assistance would increase prices to a dangerous level and threaten the very existence of a school lunch program in their district parents with incomes that require their children to pay for school lunches are opting out and their children are brownbagging it there is nothing wrong with that certainly but should this trend continue the real losers will be the poor children the r schools may be unable to

passage i first want to commend the members who have worked on this bill i think we have dealt with this bill in a responsible manner we have given our seabed mining companies what they need an interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my remarks in short i believe the bill before us meets the foreign policy and national security interests of this country as well as the interests of the seabed mining industry and i urge the members to vote for the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill from foreign affairs spring 19801"], [0.9989226460456848, 0.9989226460456848, 0, "i wish to call to the attention of my colleagues a most

for not immediately making hard choices necessary to prepare a budget that is tantamount to a doctor strangling his patient and then complaining because the clergy cant bring him back to life this

leadership this is a disgrace and the american people know where the blame lies it lies with the president of the united states and his colleagues yesterday and today we have tried to write a budget for the united states on the floor of the house of representativesand we will continue to try though as everett dirksen used to say there will be blood in the well up to our boottops before we are

taxpayer the bluecollar and whiteshirted workers the labor leadership the small businessman and the corporate boardroom the family struggling to send their children to college or graduate school persons concerned with the environment the black community and minorities generally will also find them unacceptable the one exception to this view of course is the substitute offered by the geitleman

intact the unfair tax cuts and tax loopholes for corporations and wealthy individuals his sensitivity to human needs i need not dwell onhis substitute speaks for itself i just do not believe the

109 4 billionand claims this was the best he or she could do and is in his constituents best interest if the white house likes scenarios this scenario is one of political suicide we all know that with a deficit of about 100 billion there will be no easing of interest rates you can have faith you can have trustand you can believe in this administrations economic policies if you care to but i respectfully suggest to you that this administration will still be forecasting the roaring back of the econom7 ad infinitum administration budget and economic experts must have known in their hearts that their deficit for 1983 was at the time they presented it in excess of 150 billion they also knew that their proposed defense increases and insistence on maintaining tax subsidies for the rich was feeding those deficits deficits which keep interest rates up workers unemploy d rnd families unable to buy homes cars clothes college educations for their children and the like administration economists of all people should have learned the lesson from franklin delano roosevelt when he said we have known that heedless selfinterest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics it is bad economics to fatten the rich even more than they are already bloated it is also bad short and longterm politics this administration is riding into the sunset of political oblivion with its economic brand exposed in full view to the american people k that brand spells greed and uncontrollable greed is exactly what we are seeing as the hallmark of this administration and its misguided and selfdestructive economic policies may i first talk about corporate tax subsidies the combination of accelerated depreciation leasing of tax credits plus investment credits means that all of corporate america will soon reach the zero rate of taxation already achieved by such profitable corporations as occidental petroleum ltv and burlington northern rather than helping directly those companies which should receive tax relief these budgets are helping out very profitable corporations at an extraordinary cost to the treasury the taxpayers and to the future economic recovery of this nation those special interests who gathered in washington for the lear jet weekend may find that in aiming to raid the treasurythey really ended up shooting themselves in the corporate foot the feeding frenzy generated around the federal tax trough degenerated into an exercise in timelapse cannibalism their tax benefits are costing the nation revenues it does not haveare hiking interest rates and the deficit to ungodly levelsand helping kill the recovery needed to generate their own profits and sustain healthy economic growth and the creation of jobs for the millions upon millions of anericans out of work besides reducing the revenue hemorrhageinduced by the tax benefit given to corporations and the wealthy last yearanother way in which we could cut the deficit is by repealing reducing or delaying the third year tax cut however neither the tiny net tax saving of the middle income nor the several thousands realized by those with income in six figures are justification for the economic p nalties we will all pay through persistent high interest rates if the third year tax cut is left untouched repeal or reductions in the third year tax cut are essential if money managers and investors are to be convinced of our determination to reduce deficits it is far better to adjust the third year tax cut ant thus lower interest rates and create jobs than to maintain a tax cut which guarantees that the unemployed do not even have incomes on which to pay taxes defense spending is the third area where significant federal revenues can be saved the president wants to increase defense spending by from 13 to 18 percent above inflation the house budget committee would increase defense spending by 5 percent above leflation while the committee proposaland otherscut actual spending for 1983 between 10 and 15 billion they are really merely nibbling at this mammoth fiscal cheese i maintain that before we have a truly credible defenseand one which we can sustain without seriously eroding the economywe must repair the economic damage this administrations policies have caused to our great productive economic machine better to reduce defense spending by 50 to 60 billion than risk continued and deepening recession of the economy while experiencing runaway inflation and horrendous cost overruns in the defense sector defense spending can and must be reduced significantly beyond what any of these budgets before us propose a delay of several years will not have the russians launching their strategic missiles at us assuredly cuba will not strike out at us our present military strength is such that no nation on earth would dare risk assured mutual destruction defense spending ranging from 191 to 214 billion as proposed by the various substitutes is just too high during this period of economic crisis i feel sure our allies in nato and around the world would feel far more secure s9eing a unitedstates economy in good healthwith rational interest rates with greater production and productivity and with a dollar valued to facilitate rather than dampen world trade as the saying goes when the american economy has a cold the world economy catches pneumonia these three revenue sources must be tapped the american worker running out of unemployment benefits has lost patience with this president and this administration the congress must bite the bullet and present the american people with a budget which will foster economic growth and the creation of jobs for the mllions and millions out of work we must repeal or adjust the tax benefits passed out last year during a moment of fiscal drunkenness on the part of this administration and the congresstax benefits which i happened to have voted for unfortunate ly we must repeal or adjust the third year tax cutwhich again i voted for unfortunately we must reduce defense spending to a level consistent with economic realities we cannot accept continuing deficits in the 100 billion plus renge in spite or

peoplenot hurts them we should be investing in a government that truly cares for those who cannot care for themselves to have carelessly defaulted in his leadership responsibilities on the budget indicates that this president is greatly at odds with the view the vast majority of americans hold of the american government and its responsibilities i believe this president and those around him truly misread the american people they listen too much to the rhetorical grumblings and not enough to what the people really feel the american people instinctively understand what teddy roosevelt and his cousin franklin talked about when they used the word national the american people want a government that works and not one that is to be dismantled to oblige the greed and ideological liturgy of

in this bill i hope our colleagues in the house will sustain the bill you are going to have a couple of amendments very critical amendments that will seriously impact upon the ability of this nation to meet the threat which it faces i would like to touch upon a few facts which i think are pertinent as we consider this defense bill first of all i call your attention to the comment of leonid brezhnev when he was addressing the warsaw pact heads of government back in 1973 the heads of those warsaw pact nations who were meeting with him were concerned about his feelings about detente and so they were putting him on the spot so to speak about his support of detente his answer to them was this trust us comrades for by 1985 as a consequence of what we are now achieving with detente we will have achieved most of our objectives in western europe and the shift in the correlation of forces will be such that come 1985 we will be able to exert our will wherever we need to that was back in 1973 i would like to call your attention now to some statistics that back up exactly what mr brezhnev was saying the soviets have set their goals they have achieved their schedules to their stated end thus far let us look at some of the statistics pertinent to the point turning first to the icbm and slbms strategic launchers in 1965 the soviets had 331 strategic launchers against our 1 100 today they have 2 426 and we have 1 710 strategic launchers let us look at the soviet ballistic missiles and on the same pattern in 1965 they had 107 while the united states had 496 today we have 656 and they have 1 028 let us look at the statistics with reference to the intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1965 the soviets had 224 while the united states had 654 today we have 1 028 while the soviets have 1 398 what i am saying to you is that we have not put a new ballistic missile on line since 1965 we have not put a new launcher on line since 1965 while the soviets have continued to increase their strength look at the soviet armed forces manpower with reference to ours today we have roughly 2 1 million men in our military the soviets have a military manpower of 3 6plus million what about total strategic warheads in 1965 the soviets had 530 while we had 2 716 but look how the imbalance has changed now we have a total of 6 282 while the soviets have 9 139 look at the trends see what has been happening over this period of time let us turn to soviet tanks in 1970 the soviets had 20 450 tanks today they have 26 768 we would be hard put to put 7 000 total in the field anywhere everywhere in the world what about the expernditures on defense as compared to social services we hear a lot of conversation about the fact that we are spending so much more on defense in comparison to our expenditures on social services let me review the statistics in 1960 we were spending roughly 30 percent on defense and roughly 31 percent on social services i am talking about all levels of government state and federal we are now spending 14 8 percent on defense and 49 1 on social services i just wanted to bring some of those statistics to bear because it shows that we are not spending for defense at the cost of social services now if we are not to invite disaster we dare do nothing less than what has been provided in this bill i hope the members of this house will sustain

legislation will provide necessary help where it is needed most in the federal judicial system at the appellate level i am pleased that the chairman of my committee mr rodino and two minority members on my subcommittee mr railsback and mr butler have joined in cosponsoring this proposal the intercircuit tribunal of the unitedstates courts of appeals act is a modest idea which uses for the most part existing judicial resources the new panel also will rely on existing manpower in the unitedstates marshals servic it therefore will be extremely low in cost the tribunal will be composed of between 14 and 22 circuit judges who are in regular active service or who are senior judges the judges are to be designated by the chief justice of the united states the tribunal is a patch that fits neatly in the larger tapestry of the federal judiciary the new name symbolizes this fit rather than creating a national court of appeals with transfer jurisdiction from the other courts of appealswhich actually suggests to some a lowered status for the existing excircuit courtsthe tribunal will have reference jurisdiction from the supreme court of the united otates thus all petitions for review continue to be routed to the supreme court furthermore after the rendering of a judgment by the intercircuit tribunal a petition for certiorari may once again be filed in the supreme court in the final analysis therefore any argument that this new court would act as a gatekeeper and redurce access to the supreme court must fail analysis the supreme court will remain in the words of chief justice earl warren th~e ultimate tribunal to which all citizens poor or rich may submit their claims moreover the proposed legislation dovetails neatly with the proposal to create a court of appeals for the federal circuit which presently is moving n through both the house and the senate and which hopefully wvill be enacted into law during the 97th congress sonmc commentators have argued that that bill is a national court of appeals in disguise the legislation that i am introducing today is further evidence that that argument is specious the intercircuit tribunal will be a temporary entity since it is sunsetted after 5 years due to the courts experimental nature there are reportback provisions so that congress might determine whether the court has been a failure or a success before discussing the reasons for the legislation i briefly would like to delineate its background in 1971 chief justice warren burger acting in his napacity as chairman of the federal judicial center appointed a sevenmember study group on the caseload of the supreme court the socalled freund group studied the myriad problems affecting the supreme court and submitted recommendations for change in 1972 in 1973 the congress created a commission on revision of the federal court appellate system called the hruska commission after its chairman to study the structure and internal procedures of the federal circuit courts of appeal in different forms the freund group and the hruska commission both recommended the creation of a national court of appeals their recommendation was in response to a finding by both commissions that serious caseload problems existed in the federal appellate system requiring the immediate attention of congress shortly thereafter in 1977 my subcommitteethe subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justiceheld 7 days of oversight hearings on the state of the judiciary and access to justice we received testimony from individuals who had participated in the foundation work on the freund group and the hruska commisoion testimony also was heard from the policymaking arm of the federal judiciary the judicial conference of the united states because of the serious nature of the questions considered by the subcommittee the chief justice of the united states warren e burger participated by submitting a written statement into the record the testimony and statements presented by the respected witnesses confirmed that the federal judiciary was indeed suffering from endemic overload as observed in a department of justice report submittted into the re rd by former solicitor general robert bork the federal courts however now ftxce a crisis of overload a crisis so seriour that it threatens the capacity of the federal system to function as it should this is not a crisis for the courts alone it is a crisis for litiganti who seek justice for claims of humrnn rights for the rule of law and it is therefore a crisis for the nation as regards the appellate capacity of the federal court system this overload was described as having especially deleterious effects one of the main functions of appellate courts is to insure uniformity and consistency in the law by resolving conflicts in decisions between or among trial courts or lowcr appellate courts the supreme courtwhich of course sits at the apex of the federal judicial systemcan devote plenary consideration only to about 150 cases a year hundreds of other petitions from the circuit courts have to be left unsettled some of these appeals are of high national priority or identify serious splits among the circuits some concern individual rights guaranteed by the constitution and sonmc relate to the delicate balance of powers in our federal union since my subcommittees hearings appellate court problems have actually worsened congress has had a hand in this in moving to resolve court congestioni we have substantially broadened the base of the judicial pyramid perhaps because problems are easier to identify at the trial level perhaps because they are more amenable to legislation solution congress acted several times during the 95th and 96th congresses to confront problems at the trial level of the federal judiciary the unitedstates magistrates system was reformed a comprehensive bankruptcy act was passed and an omnibus judgeship bill was enacted these legislative initiativesconsidered collectivelydramatically broadened the ground floor of the judicial pyramid the net result has been dramatic statistical increases in the number of appeals being taken from the district courts to the circuit courts and ulti~iately to the supreme court with the exception of the creation of a handful of circuit judges circuit council reform and the split of the fifth circuit nothing has been legislatively enacted that would imnprove the functioning of the federal appellate system it is noteworthy in this regard that the modest appellate improvements mentioned above have assisted the courts of appeals while actually placing more burdens on the supreme court in short the workload of the supreme courtwhich in 1972 as being at the satuation pointis now assuming even more dangerous proportions as a consequence immediate remedial measures are called for these measures should not dramatcally alter the nature of the high court rather they should rely on its essential role in the american judicial system several things can be done first diversity of citizenship jurisdiction ought to be abolished there is a high number of appeals in these cases and therefore the elimination of diversity would actually improve the functioning of all elementstrial and appellatein the federal court system i already have introduced legislation see h r 2404 97th congress 1st session 1981 to accomplish this end similarly the mandatory jurisdiction of the supreme court should be eliminated we rely on the supreme court to resolve cases on the merits we certainly can rely on the court to determine which cases it can hear for my legislation to accomplish this end see h r 2408 97th congress 1st session 1081 last as explained above we should create an intercircuit tribunalcomposed of sitting circuit judges to assist the supreme court in satisfying its enormous responsibilities by deciding matters assigned to it by the supreme court the tribunal would be of enormous assistance to the high court especially in the area of resolving circuit conflicts and insuring national uniformity of the laws i believe that the ultimate beneficiaries would be all the people in this country i encourage my colleagues to take a hard look at this legislation many of the members of the house and judiciary committees have informally considered this idea at the last of our williamsburg meetings their initial support has encouraged me to work on this legislative proposal i already have shared a draft with chief justice warren burger and prof leo levin director of the federal judicial center as individuals they have expressed support for this modest proposal have encouraged its introduction and have asked for its careful consideration by all interested members of congress in closing i urge your support for this bill the text of the bill follows h r 4762 a bill to establish an intercircuit tribunal of the

millions of americans now working who are unable to work simply because the jobs are not there and i think that the shadow side or the other side of the inflationary coin is unemployment i think it is interesting to note that a lot of the economists whose wisdom or supposed wisdom we have been following over the last so many decades have always told us according to their orthodoxy that it was the choice of unemployment on the one hand and inflation on the other and they would go so far as to suggest in the classroom and other economists forums that if one were a republican he would favor a policy that would diminish inflation but at the expense of raising unemployment and if one were a democrat he would favor a policy that would diminish unemployment but at the expense of inflation but now we are not confronted with a choice we are confronted with these things en bloc they are both upon us in some vicious kind of partnership so i think that some of the economic wisdom from the past perhaps is not as telling as it might be and we are confronted with something that the economists have always said before should be an alternative i think that must drive us back to a incre
