this dream and this celebration we are appreciative that you have come to this congress and done many things but you brought us to a moment every year to be able to honor this storied organization 106 years old so let me thank my good friend congressman green my nextdoor neighbor in houston and a friend of many of the same friends we know the work of the naacp local chapter in houston texas now the leading president is as i call him dean james douglas many presidents before of course have ably served our local chapter but we come today to acknowledge the grandness of the naacp and as my colleague congressman rangel just mentioned it is an organization that is everywhere in all ways it is well to note that many of the successes that we have had in freedom justice and liberty have come about through the naacp president truman was the first president in 1948 to speak to the naacp but it was not just an oration if you will the naacp seeks to work collaborate and get things done it was that close relationship with president truman that generated a commission that in the late 1940s after world war ii where soldiers came home to a secondclass citizenship soldiers who left the hills and valleys of america the farms and the urban centers of america african americans colored boys who went into world war ii came out as a secondclass citizen you will hear stories of soldiers coming back home being forced off trains or in the back of the train or the back of the bus not being offered food at a train station even with the uniform on so heroes that had fought in the war and managed to survive and come home still came to a segregated america it was in that backdrop that president truman spoke to the naacp and they called for a commission to address the question of civil rights in america out of that came thebecause it was in the realm of world war ii out of that came an important announcement that really i think was the predecessor to desegregating america that of course was the executive order that desegregated the united states military that is the clout of the naacp through the yearsthrough the yearsthe naacp certainly has a long history starting in its early birth but i want to carry it forward into the 1950s and into the utilization of thurgood marshall now it is called the naacp legal defense fund that separated it out but it was these lawyers of the naacp that rose to defend those in the civil rights movement who were the foot soldiers and the actors of the civil rights movement meaning acting on the issue the activists and they had the cerebral opportunity if you will the cerebral leaders the lawyers that came together to provide them the legal armor that they needed certainly we know that thurgood marshall had a very fond expression and appreciation for the naacp so we come through these years in the 1950s and the 1960s and the kind of continued support that the naacp provided in lasting and embracinglasting and embracingso it embraced the southern christian leadership conference which i had the privilege of working for it embraced various other organizations it embraced the various faiths in our community and it embraced any organization that was moving toward justice as dr king said bending that arc toward justice the naacp was there with its many chapters and it was there with providing the education of so many of these individuals that were in fact i call them foot soldiers in every hamlet of america now we come if i may cite him in the civil rights movement again joining with those marching across the edmund pettus bridge being a mighty vehicle if i might a lobbyist i understand congressman clarence mitchell was called the 101st senator he was a lobbyist for the naacp he was on the cutting edge of every single civil rights legislation for a period of i believe 40 years i may be exaggerating the timeframe but he was there for the 64 civil rights act there for the 65 voting rights act clarence mitchell of the naacp was an advocate not a lobbyist on behalf of the naacp and met and stood if you will to debate not on the floor of the senate with the strom thurmonds and others who had a different opinion about desegregation of this country let me take note of the fact that today i had the privilege of seeing an unveiling of a stamp in honor of robert robinson taylor the greatgrandfather of valerie jarrett and what i would say is that even his success in the backdrop of being the first graduate of mit african american graduate you can be assured that the naacp was moving along to add to the civil rights aspect of the great outstanding success and leadership that this gentleman mr taylor has shown so the naacp has been there to make a pathway the naacp has been there to embrace the naacp has been there to collaborate the naacp has been there to stand with you when you need them to stand with you i close by indicating that we have had a challenging year of addressing issues of criminal justice reform and i am very grateful that the naacp has also taken up this issue and will be a partner on this issue of criminal justice reform working with many of us as we commit to americanot just african americansthat we will answer the question dealing with justice equality and liberty i pay tribute finally mr green to the leader of actso who lost her life in the local chapter of the naacp i want to honor her and thank her for the years that i knew her and her service to young people in the actso program in houston texas to her family i want to thank her so much for the work that she did and the lives that she touched that is the naacp tonight i say i am the naacp congratulations for 106 years thank you mr green for yielding"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman kelly for those very generous remarks but also for your tremendous leadership and for staying the course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for the chance to be with you tonight"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman robin kelly and congressman donald payne jr for hosting this important special order i appreciate your leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i urge my colleagues to join us in securing health equity for all"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i come to the floor today just to take a few minutes to call attention to a problem that i have been trying to raise in this body and in my work before i came to congress for some time specifically to describe the conditions in my own hometown of flint michigan the subject that i am addressing is the unique and really difficult challenges facing americas older industrial cities cities like my hometown of flint michigan a city that is the birthplace of general motors it is where the first uaw contract was created was signed but it is a city that has really struggled as it has made this transition from the old to the new economy it is a city that had 200 000 people just a couple of decades ago and now hovers right around 100 000 citizens a poorer city than it once was a city that has lost 90 percent of its manufacturing jobs i raise this because i believe that this congress and the federal government have an obligation to reinvest in these communities communities that helped build this country and that can have a significant effect on our future these are the cities where innovation took place and where it can take place again but my own hometown right now is struggling struggling with a problem unfortunately that is not entirely of its own making my home of flint a city that was once really the center of the auto manufacturing universe cant even guarantee to its citizens one of the most essential functions of government it cant guarantee to citizens that it can deliver clean drinkable water to their households we have elevated lead levels in the city of flint in their water system it has been known for some time for about a year that there have been significant problems with water quality in flint and despite protests really at the state and federal levels public officials saying that there is no problem with the water that it is completely safe to drinkin fact one state official told city of flint residents that they just needed to simply relax it has been revealed recently through independent studies now confirmed by the state government that we have lead levels far in excess of what is allowed under the federal lead and copper rules this is completely unacceptable in fact what makes this even more troubling is that this is a tragic set of circumstances that has public health implications for the citizens of my community that were completely avoidable that are the result of decisions that were made by the state of michigan when it took over control of this fiscally stressed city this is a city that is struggling in a lot of different ways twice in the last decade it has been under the control of a receiver of a stateappointed emergency manager that takes away the authority of local government officials to make decisions for themselves takes away the authority of the flint citizens to elect their own representatives to govern themselves and places authority to control the city in the hands of a single master an emergency manager well it was during the period of time that one of those emergency managers was in control that the state decided for the city of flint that for a temporary period of time simply to save money it would begin to draw water rather than from the city of detroit water system which had a water source from lake huron but it would begin to draw water from the flint river a small river that passes through our hometown a river that is the namesake of our own community the sad thing isand this tells you a little bit about how some folks in different levels of government at the federal and state level think about these older cities there was no robust review no testing no examination as to whether or not this river water would result in clean water being delivered to homes drinkable water delivered to citizens as a result this water drawn from the flint river is substantially more corrosive and has led to lead leaching from the pipes in the delivery system into the drinking water in flint homes in fact there was a study that was just done in the last day or two that shows that in flint school district buildings water being delivered to flint schoolchildren has lead levels far above the actionable level under the epa lead and copper rule think about this in the 21st century in the united states of america we have a city a great old city that was a part of the industrial revolution that cant even deliver clean and safe drinking water to its citizens not only because of our failure to invest in infrastructure in this country which is a big part of the problem but largely because officials at the state government simply decided well that flint river water that will be good enough there was no real scientific research that determined whether or not that water would be safe it will be fine and even when evidence was presented indicating that that water might be unsafe flint citizens were told by the state government to just relax dont worry about it well that is a complete failure of government it is a failure of government frankly at the federal level because for almost a year now i have been asking the epa to intervene to first of all help this old city of flint rebuild itself and rebuild its water system by providing some relief through the clean drinking water revolving loan fund some degree of loan forgiveness which is allowable under federal law but in this case a technicality has prevented the epa from allowing the state of michigan to grant that kind of relief that could make a huge difference for the city and its ability to rebuild its own infrastructure but so far all we get from the epa is no and we asked for technical assistance from the epa now recently we have had more attention but frankly it is not enough i mean where is the urgency if the role of the unitedstates epa is to ensure adherence to this rule this law that requires clean and safe drinking water to be available to its citizens they ought to do more than sit back and offer opinion they need to be engaged so i call on the epa to take a much more focused role in making sure that the citizens of flint have clean drinking water i mentioned that this was not an accident this decision to use this questionable water source was done when the city was under financial receivership when an appointed emergency manager was making the decisions for the city of flint so here we had a situation where this emergency manager this outside new management is appointed to come in and deal with the issue of fiscal insolvency and by only looking at the shortterm balance sheet made a decision to get cheaper water that turned out to be dangerous for the residents of the city and actually potentially has handed the city a huge cost to fix what could be hundreds of millions of dollars of permanent damage to the water system as a result of that decision so an emergency manager comes in with the idea that somehow outside management is the only problem that this city faces makes decisions that not only ruin the reputation of the city but also cause significant health risks and then hands the city a bill potentially to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars and at the same time over the last decade has continued to cut direct support to that very city i mean this just doesnt make sense the citizens of the city are not responsible for the fact that its infrastructure has been allowed to deteriorate they are not responsible for the fact that at the federal level and at the state level we have not supported redevelopment in these places in fact through transportation policy housing policy tax policy land use policy at the federal and state levels we have actually unfortunately contributed to the hollowing out of these older cities and now the citizens of this place have to pay the price the failure to reinvest in these older cities is not without victims and right now it is the people of the city of flint that are the victims of a failure at the federal frankly and at the state level it is something that just cannot be tolerated so when we think about this question when we think about this particular case of the city my hometown of flint and the fact that these decisions have been made for them by people at the state capital they are paying the price and almost inexplicably even though today in a complete reversal an admission of failure by the state the state has come in and said now they are going to help facilitate the reconnection temporarily to the detroit water system until a permanent lake huron line can be established inexplicably there they are actually asking the city government to empty out its remaining resources financial resources and put millions of dollars up to help contribute to pay for fixing a problem that the state government is actually responsible for making the state broke the system and now yet again it is the city residents who are being asked to contribute to pay for a problem that they did not create in the first place sadly while this may seem like an extreme case it is a pretty consistent tale all across this country but especially in the northeast and midwestern united states but in the south and west as well there are older cities that have in the past contributed greatly to economic growth in this country and have been allowedin some ways encouragedto wither to be hollowed out and we cant let this continue so here when we see before our very eyes 30 40 50 american citiesas i said including my own hometowncontinue to fall farther and farther behind have their infrastructure continue to deteriorate what do we spend our time talking about here in the united states congress petty fights between democrats and republicans and frankly more recently petty fights between republicans and other republicans we havent even touched the idea of a big infrastructure bill that could help places not just like my hometown of flint but other places across the midwest and across the country that could be much more productive if we simply had 21st century infrastructure a water system that can deliver clean water to its residents there is no excuse there is no excuse at the federal level for us not providing the kind of help that would make a place like flint a far more productive place with decent roads good schools and a water system that delivers clean water i mean that seems pretty fundamental and it is without that these older communities these older cities have no chance of connecting to the new economy no chance of contributing the way they are capable of to the next economy of this country it is shameless that we havent seen the urgency that i think is required in order to deal with this enormous problem there are victims of this failure there are victims individuals who have been really left behind because of the failure at the federal and at the state level so i know i have taken a few moments i dont need to take the full half hour that has been allotted to me because we will continue this discussion we will continue this conversation i just want to make sure that the folks who are listening the people in this body people across the country understand that unless we take time unless we make the effort in this body to address the problems of these older cities we will not have done our job it is important that the american people know that this congress is willing to stand up for them and stand up for americas cities i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i come to the floor today to mark world aids day i do so in great pride following my colleague from ohio congresswoman joyce beatty who spoke on the floor about the 60th anniversary of what happened in montgomery when rosa parks with great courage refused to give up her seat on the bus the courage of that woman and all of those who supported her has made such an incredible difference in our country and it is indeed related to what i want to say about hiv and aids many of us had the privilege of knowing rosa parks when she worked for john conyers we honored her here in the house and are so proud that we have a statue of rosa parks in the capitol of the united states we think of her and we think of the courage she had which led to the civil rights act the voting rights act and that voting rights act and civil rights act led to our having a much more diverse congress of the united states from there came our congressional black caucus the hispanic caucus and the asian pacific caucus the black caucus directly related to mr conyers who was a founding member and rosa parks who was an inspiration they were responsible for so much change in the leadership of our congress and because so many issues spring from the congressional black caucus some say the conscience of the congress so the relationship from rosa parks through the caucus to now we are observing the 25th anniversary of world aids day the link is congresswoman barbara lee who has been such a champion in the congress on this subject we take great pride in the accomplishments she has had in her capacity as a member of congress but also as our representative to the united nations general assembly each year world aids day is observed internationally to reflect the progress that has been made in reaffirming our determination to banish aids to the annals of history we recognize that achieving an aidsfree generation requires our relentless energetic and undaunted commitment to testing treatment and finding a cure the world aids day theme this year the time to act is now challenges us to act with the urgency that this global epidemic demands aids as we know and the hiv virus is a ferocious and resourceful disease a resourceful virus evermutating to escape our efforts to destroy it therefore we have to be ferocious resourceful and adaptable in our effort to succeed to end hiv we must bring bold thinking and deep commitment to testing treatment and the search for a cure and a vaccine to prevent president bush with his pepfar initiative took a big advance in how we can help prevent the spread of aids in the rest of the world he and mrs bush with their pink ribbon red ribbon initiative to link cervical cancer prevention with hiv testing and treatment in africa was a remarkable initiative so we salute the bipartisanship we supported of course president bush with pepfar we wanted it bigger and he wanted it strong and there we were with something that has saved millions of lives and given hope to people i visited some of the clinics in africa where pepfar is being administered and some of the people i met there said i would never have come in to be tested before because there was no reason i had no hope that there would be any remedy or any maintaining of a quality of life that would have encouraged me to risk the stigma of saying that i was hivinfected so again it is all about the people in new york today bono will be observing the 10th anniversary of the one and red initiatives that have set out to alleviate poverty and eradicate disease with a heavy focus on hiv aids we know the work of the melinda and bill gates foundation and what they have done on this issue particularly in india i today also wish i could be in san francisco where amfar will be saluting the work at university of californiasan francisco on hiv aids by establishing a new initiative there i am just mentioning a few other observances of world aids day it is happening throughout the world if you go back a number of years when i came to congress we were going to two funerals a day it was the saddest thing now we are going to weddings and helping people make out their wills and all the rest because they have a longer life ahead the maintenance of life the quality of life is really important but we do want a cure so i said it was the 25th anniversary of world aids day i meant to say the 25th anniversary of the ryan white care act that young man whose name is something that is iconic to all of us left us but his mother carries on the tradition and it has made such a tremendous difference my colleague henry waxman who is no longer in the congress but is still a champion on hiv aids was so instrumental in leading us to passing that legislation so it has been bipartisan it is global it is personal it is urgent that we continue so that one day 50 years from now people will say what was aids what was that and the books will show that it was a terrible terrible tragedy that befell the worlds population regardless of status of wealth of gender or of race and something that is now buried in the news somewhere as a terrible memory but not a part of our future again as we observe world aids day may we all wear our red ribbons in sympathy with those who have lost their lives sadly before the science took us to a better place on this that is what we are counting on research and science to take us to a better place on this and also the enthusiasm determination and relentlessness of so many people throughout the world to make hiv aids a horrible horrible memory again but not part of our future"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise in honor of the special order hour titled bridging the divide a call to action by the congressional black caucus to eliminate racial health disparities i would like to thank my colleagues congressman hakeem jeffries and congresswoman joyce beatty for hosting this timely special order historically racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care while the affordable care act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities for example the department of health and human services is currently working to expand access end racial and ethnic discrimination perform outreach to underserved communities improve workforce diversity and expand data collection and reporting while this is an ambitious plan it is one that is extremely necessary unfortunately coverage access and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status for example research shows that privately insured african american and hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care unfortunately african americans and hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts the same research also showed that privately insured african americans and hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs since social determinants like economic stability education and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on healthrelated programs reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing affordable food access to education job opportunities communitybased resources public safety public transportation and more our society must make many changes before we can truly eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities because that also means eliminating disparities in many other sectors i thank congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty for hosting this poignant special order tibet"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise today as a vice chair of the house gun violence prevention task force and in solidarity with the majority of americans who are demanding that congress take meaningful action to prevent gun violence we all know the statistics whether it is through mass shootings that make the headlines or the unseen violence that happens daily on our streets gun violence takes the lives of more than 30 000 of our nations citizens each year a number that far exceeds other industrial countries now all these countries have their share of violent extremists and madmen but only our country gives easy access to weapons of mass killing and that makes all the difference for america rather than seeking out commonsense solutions to address this crisis the republican majority continues to cower to the gun lobby and the firearms manufacturers now they plead the second amendment but constitutional law 101 would tell us that all of our rights including the precious freedoms of religion and speech must be balanced to protect innocent third parties and to protect the safety of the wider community one commonsense measure we should all agree on is background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill you cant shout fire in a crowded theater because of your freedom of speech and neither should you be able to buy a weapon if you have a history of violence and criminality in fact almost 90 percent of americans including the majority of gun owners support universal background checks for all gun purchases the problem is that our present background check system is rife with loopholes background checks are not required for private sales at gun shows they are also not required for internet sales bipartisan legislation has been introduced by representatives peter king and mike thompson that would finally close this egregious loophole it is an entirely sensible reform that would have a measurable impact on the safety of our schools homes and neighborhoods without preventing lawabiding citizens from using guns for selfdefense or recreational purposes despite attracting 186 cosponsors including several republicans the background check legislation has never been brought to the floor or even received a hearing in committee it has been languishing for more than 15 months meanwhile the shootings and the suicides and the massacres continue to accumulate my colleagues we must do better our fellow citizens are totally fed up both with the unspeakable killing and suffering and with a feckless congress that hasnt lifted a finger to prevent it now this week after intense public criticism and a historic protest by democrats on the house floor republicans seemed for a while to be willing to hold a vote on legislation they claim

existing bipartisan legislation to actually fix the problem republicans put forth a woefully inadequate proposal that would require law enforcement and courts to grapple with unworkable processes unreachable standards to be completed in an unreasonably short period of time their bill would allow suspected terrorists to receive firearms by default after only 3 days if the court is unable to work through a complicated process that is the same flaw that allowed the white supremacist charleston shooter to obtain the weapon that he used to murder nine people at emanuel ame church in other

introduced by our republican colleague peter king this bill says that if you are on the fbis terrorist watch list then you dont get to walk into a gun store pass a background check and leave with the weapon of your choice if there is one thing both sides of the aisle should be able to agree on it is keeping guns away from suspected terrorists bring that bill up for a vote the second bill h r 1217with 186 coauthors democrats and republicanswould close a dangerous loophole in our background check system that allows criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill to bypass a background check altogether and instead purchase their guns online or at a gun show or through a classified ad this is a huge loophole and it costs lives you dont have to look any further than the sister of elvin daniel from wisconsin his sister zina had a restraining order against her husband which prevented him from passing a background check when he tried to buy a gun in a store nevertheless zinas husband was able to go online and buy the same gun a 40caliber semiautomatic handgun and he took that gun and used it to kill zina and two other people in a store in wisconsin this bill would close these kinds of loopholes and help stop criminals from getting guns everyone says they want to keep guns away from dangerous people but the only way to know if someone is dangerous is to conduct

unsafe untreated source which has exposed tens of thousands of residents to toxic lead levels exposure to leada potent neurotoxincarries lifelong consequences flint parents must now raise children who face lifelong developmental and behavioral challenges cover economic costs their city cannot afford and confront mounting medical bills that cannot undo the harm they have suffered our thoughts and prayers are with them but they need more than thatthey need action it has become an all too common tale that whenever an urban or lowincome communitys water or air quality is in question risks to the health and safety of its residents are ignored this must stop underserved communities generally face socalled acceptable risks that no other community or suburb would ever acceptor be asked to accept this must stop in flint the decision was made by someone they never voted for and approved by someone who did not care that it might lead to toxic exposure for citys residents this must stop the time

offering half measures free water that they cannot drink anyway a fraction of what is needed to fix flints plumbing and resources that cannot possibly overcome the health impacts of lead exposure it

similarly exposed it means repairing the infrastructure so that they can have clean water again preventing this from happening in the future starts with strengtheningnot cuttingour enforcement

estimates required under section 402 of the congressional budget act of 1974 budget act the macroeconomic effects of major legislation because this rule builds on the existing requirement for cost estimates it does not apply to appropriations legislation by including an analysis of how major legislation will affect the economy this rule provides the house with a more comprehensive estimate than can be produced using only the traditional conventional scoring methods which implicitly assume that legislation has no effect on the broader economy in particular this analysis is required to include the budgetary effects of changes in economic output employment the capital stock and other macroeconomic variables resulting from major legislation in addition this rule requires a qualitative assessment of the longterm budgetary and macroeconomic effects of major legislation major legislation is defined as legislation causing an increase or decrease in revenues outlays or deficits in any fiscal year covered by the budget resolution equal to or greater than 0 25 percent of the projected gross domestic product for that year in applying the 0 25 percent threshold cbo and jct are required to look at the gross budgetary effects of the legislation in carrying out this requirement the intent is that cbo and jct review provisions in the bill that have a significant effect thus the test is whether any provision in the legislation has a budgetary effect larger than the threshold or if the absolute value of the sum of the provisions exceeds the threshold rather than whether the legislation as a whole has such an effect when all of the provisions are netted out alternately for legislation that may not have a large fiscal effect but would still have significant economic impacts the new rule empowers the house to designate major legislation for all legislation other than purely revenue legislation the rule authorizes the chair of the budget committee to designate major legislation for purely revenue legislation i e legislation that contains only provisions described in section 201 f of the budget act the rule authorizes the house member serving as the chair or vice chair of jct to designate major legislation for purposes of this rule the rule carefully preserves the existing division of labor between cbo and jct which requires close collaboration between these two nonpartisan institutions when major legislation involves both revenue and nonrevenue provisions cbo and jct will need to work together to produce a single integrated cost estimate for the legislation drawing on each agencys institutional responsibilities the rule requires enhanced transparency around these budgetary estimates both cbo and jct as applicable must provide together with their estimates a description of the critical assumptions and the source data underlying such estimates it is important that cbo and jct make this information available so that the public academic and other experts have an opportunity to review the analysis and pursue possible improvements in the methodologies used to develop these estimates distributional analyses of proposed tax changes that jct provides as background information is another area where estimates could be improved by incorporating macroeconomic effects into these analyses the preparation of cost estimates incorporating macroeconomic effects is frequently more complex and requires more time than the preparation of conventional cost estimates committees should therefore build in additional time to allow for the completion of the cost estimate both cbo and jct should strive to promptly produce the estimates required by this rule to the extent it is not practicable for cbo and jct to produce the required estimates the rule provides an accommodation in this instance two possible circumstances may arise when it is not feasible to produce the required analysis first committees and the house may be operating under tight deadlines and it is not possible for cbo or jct to complete the analysis prior to the legislations consideration second while cbo and jct have developed a great deal of expertise

our air and water if properly collected the oil can be burned once for use as lowcost fuel however the best option uses modern technology which now exists to collect and sustainably recycle used oil

actively used by dod and other federal agencies public and commercial fleets and average consumers with great success however far too little of our used oil is recycled in this way so my amendment is intended to increase conservation and sustainable reuse the last major federal study was called for in the energy policy act of 2005 that study was issued in 2006 but relied on data that was then 10 years old now that data is 20 years old my amendment will require the doe to update that data so that we know how much oil is available and how much is actually being reused and rerefined data from 20 years ago showed that the united states was well behind other developed and even some developing countries in terms of sustainable reuse this amendment will also provide for the development of policies that can significantly increase both the collection rate and sustainable reuse of this valuable resource i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from michigan"],

the development of a national strategy to combat terrorist travel by bolstering efforts to intercept terrorists and foreign fighters while also constraining their domestic and international travel i applaud the work of the committee on homeland securitys task force on combating terrorist and foreign fighter travel one of the many findings of the task forces final report was that it has been a decade since the executive branch produced a governmentwide plan to constrain terrorist travel in the years since the issuance of the last governmentwide plan in 2006 many programs aimed at restricting or preventing terrorist travel have changed or ended and new programs have been created the task force found that hundreds of programs projects and initiatives have sprouted up to combat terrorist travel since 9 11 but there is no overarching strategy to coordinate them importantly h r 4408 requires that the strategy include an updated full accounting and description of americas terror travel preventative and protective measures this accounting should provide a valuable baseline for future efforts to prevent terrorist travel h r 4408 requires the president to submit to congress a national strategy focused on disrupting and intercepting terrorists and foreign fighters the strategy is to include an accounting of all unitedstates government programs to constrain terrorist travel identify gaps and how they will be closed and describe actions to eliminate waste overlap and duplication of efforts the evolving nature of the terrorist threat demands a

eradication efforts i have been warning my colleagues in congress for months that the zika virus would severely impact our nation and especially south florida the gateway to the americas and while washington has slumbered through the late summer it has been a busy august in south florida dealing with the fallout it is because of federal inaction that now miamidade county will be spending 10 million of our own budget to cover for some of the expenses in the fight against zika back in february i cosponsored four bills to help start comprehensive preparations for the virus arrival including opening up funding sources for mosquito control freeing the administration to reprogram unspent ebola funds for fighting zika and incentivizing pharmaceutical companies to begin developing treatments and vaccines for zika in march i requested that 177 million be made available specifically for aid to local mosquito control programs extra funding for the cdcs division of vectorborne diseases and new dollars for innovative mosquito control tool development in april i voted in favor of using the fdas priority review voucher program to incentivize zika virus treatment development in may i voted to give state and local authorities a temporary waiver providing more flexibility in using epaapproved insecticides for mosquito control i also voted against an inadequate 600 million zika supplemental funding bill joining 183 other members because public health experts contended that it would not be enough to deal with the expected impact of zika in the unitedstates in june i voted in favor of a 1 1 billion zika funding bill that passed the house but did not pass the senate yesterday the senate again stopped any debate on zika funding in response to a meager grant sum delivered to the state of florida after the discovery of mosquito transmission in wynwood a section in the city of miami in early august i led the entire florida congressional delegation in a letter urging the cdc to deliver more funds to florida where they were most needed as a result of that letter and other efforts the obama administration announced that it would indeed reprogram another 81 million for antizika efforts but now the cdc director has stated that the cdc has no more funds available to use for zika interdiction and eradication we need a comprehensive response that limits the spread of this virus as quickly as possible this is long overdue i was ready to go back into an emergency session weeks and weeks ago to pass a comprehensive package but despite my pleas this house did not reconvene now the house is back in session but to this point no votes on a zika funding bill are scheduled how much longer do south floridians need to wait for the government to commit more resources to fighting zika my constituents are tired and fed up with excuses and buckpassing i am sick of congress partisan fighting and political grandstanding i stand united with the hardworking residents and families of south florida and i will continue working on their behalf to demand that this congress do its job and protect the american people lets pass the presidents request for 1 1 billion to fight zika and develop a vaccinea clean bill with no policy ridersand pass it before this virus spreads even wider throughout our great nation here we have a picture of an area of the district that is impacted already we have other areas that are impacted we have other areas in florida we have other areas throughout the united states lets stop zika we can do it lets pass the funding bill"]],

helpful for firstgeneration and atrisk college students who need an accurate picture of a colleges price tag well in advance in order to make their decision in september i was happy to see president obama take executive action to allow for the use of priorprior year tax data for students the bipartisan bill before us would make this executive action permanent and is an important step toward making college more affordable ensuring future students are afforded the opportunity to use prior year tax data when filling out the fafsa form additionally the simplifying the application for student aid act will also direct the department of education to develop a mobile app for using fafsa this will allow millions of americans who do not have broadband access but do have internet connectivity on
