pueblo americano esta con ustedes y aqui en el congreso de los estados unidos vamos a defender su libertad y ganar la lucha contra la brutalidad y la opresi6n por eso junto con mis otras colegas en el cpngreso escribi esta resoluci6n que condena la ola represiva contra los disidentes que hizo la r~gimen castro hace dos ahos y que declara que la gente cubana debe tener los derechos humanos y la libertadla libertad de expresi6n y de asociaci6ny el derecho de tener elecci6nes libres to all my friends here today who dont speak spanish dont worry i wont spend the rest of my time speaking in spanish but i did want to take a~moment to speak directly to the cuban people to let them know that we stand with them in their fight for freedom and human rights we are debating this resolution today under the shadow of the 2nd anniversary of the crackdown on dissidents in cuba we often think of an anniversary as a moment to celebratebut clearly we have nothing to celebrate today instead we use this anniversary to mark a tragedy inthe lives of the cuban people and to the lives of all those who support democracy and human rights in the hemisphere the whole world was horrified as more than 75 journalists human rights activists and opposition political figures were arrested given summary trials and then sentenced to prison terms of up to 28 years many of the prisoners along with other prisoners of conscience spent over a year in solitary confinement some have been deprived of adequate medical treatment and reports from cuba detail beatings and harassment i am not fooled by the recent release of a number of dissidents by this attempt to trick the international community i am not fooled because i know that when they released those dissidents who should never have been in jail in the first place they also arrested new dissidents i am not fooled because i know that they only released these dissidents on parole meaning that they could be arrested again at any time hundreds of political prisoners remain in castros jails today clearly the castro regime has no respect for the universal declaration of human rights which states in article 4 that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or pun ishment and the world has recognized these injustices the state department calls this wave the most despicable act of political repression in the americas in a decade castros human rights record has been condemned by amnesty international freedom house and other human rights groups in a statement amnesty international said that these prisoners of conscience should be immediately released and called on the cuban regime to comply with the principles laid out in international rights standards for the treatment of prisoners freedom house included cuba in its report entitled the worst of the worst the worlds most repressive societies 2004 and the house of representatives has condemned castros human rights record as well in multiple resolutions this year on the twoyear anniversary we are here to pass a resolution that condemns castros brutal crackdown and demands that the cuban regime immediately release all political prisoners legalize all political parties labor unions and the press and hold free and fair elections today is a time for all of us to come together from both sides of the aisle to stand together for a universal cause human rights today in voting for this resolution we will celebrate the strength and perseverance of the cuban people today we will vote for the universal values which we all share so i call on all of the members of the house of representatives to join me in the fight for human rights and democracy for the cuban people now is the time for us to stand together against brutality torture and dictatorship now is the time for us to stand together for freedom for the right to free speech and free association and for human rights in general now is the time for us to stand together as we call on the cuban regirpe to immediately release these prisoners of conscience who were jailed for standing up for democracy and human rights against a brutal dictatorship to my brothers and sisters who suffer in castros jails to their families and friends both here in the united states and cuba and to the cuban people i say that castro will not succeed in his vain attempt to suppress the spirit of the cuban people i look forward to the day which is coming soon when we will all celebrate a free and democratic cuba it is the spirit of the cuban people and their courage that will ultimately be castros downfall so i ask each of you to join me in voting yes for this resolution"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "absolutely let us just look at one thing we have been talking about here one of the major costs of the kind of institutional corruption that is going on right now is what is going oni with the interest on the debt the nations debt is now over 8 trillion with a t and the interest in the 2007 presidents budget the interest alone is almost twohundredandtwentysome billion dollars out of this budget now when you look and you compare what we have to pay in interest on the debt compared to what we are paying for education or homeland security or veterans it is totally and utterly disproportionate to the kind of investments we need to be making because this money and on the chart here we are borrowing this money from the japanese government we are borrowing the money from the chinese government we are borrowing the money from opec countries we are ceding our country away to these other foreign interests and at the same time we are asking japan and cliina to borrow money because we do not have enough because we are giving out corporate subsidies to the oil companies and corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical companies while we are doing that we have to go and borrow the money from the chinese government and then we have to borrow it from the opec countries and as we showed before earlier an hour or so ago the chinese government is taking this money they are lending it to us collecting the interest and investing that money in the training of engineers to the tune of 600 000 engineers that they are going to train next year while we are training 70 that really is the bottom line that these kind of decisions are leading and costing they are leading to enormous problems for our country and they are costing us a lot of money they are really beginning i think to push the burden down on to the next generation we cannot continue to sustain the kind of deficits that we are running the next year or 2007 years budget deficit is projected at over 400 billion 400 billion and that is unacceptable while we are giving the oil industry 12 billion and 16 billion to the energy industry and we are giving to the tune of 50 60 70 billion to the health care industry in subsidies it is a coincidence or maybe it is not that the oil industrys profits are going through the roof so it begs the question why are we subsidizing them the energy companies profits going up subsidizing them too pharmaceutical companies profits through the roof subsidize them too this is paytoplay in washington d c and all the while it is happening at the expense of average people all this is happening at the cost of the american people there is a corruption tax there is a

to raise the debt limit for the third time during this administration to a whopping 8 18 trillion i used the occasion to contrast the fiscal policies of the clinton administration namely turning the largest budget deficits in history to the largest budget surpluses in history with the fiscal policies of the current administration however my protestations and the warnings of my fellow blue dog democrats continued to fall on deaf ears it is inconceivable that deficits soaring as far as the eye can see mounting debt and the skyrocketing costs of military operations in iraq and afghanistan would be ignored for so long and that it would take a tragedy such as hurricane katrina to finally serve as a wakeup call for years members of the blue dog coalition have warned that we were spending money we did not have that the administration had no economic plan and that massive untargeted tax cutswere not a substitute for an economic blueprint for our countrys future and yet the congress continued to reject every proposal requiring us to do our budget in the same way that our constituents do by paying as we go now that hurricanes katrina and rita have wreaked havoc on the gulf coast causing hundreds of billions of dollars of damage it is clear that we must take immediate action to get our fiscal house in order members on the other side of the aisle have finally acknowledged what democrats have been saying for years that our current economic policies cannot be maintained unfortunately however some in the majority party have proposed that we ask those americans who have been impacted most by katrina namely the elderly and those with low incomes to bear the costs this is not the answer to the persistent poverty exposed so brutally and graphically by katrina we must pursue a comprehensive solution to our fiscal woes by suspending tax cuts for wealthy families by cutting spending and enacting paygo rules payasyougo and establishing an emergency rainy day fund the 2005 budget resolution included 106 billion in new deficit finance tax cuts over the next 5 years these additional tax cuts will impose a huge additional debt burden on the next generation if the government is forced to borrow the money to cover these added expenses the yearly interest payments alone will pile on the already enormous debt that our children and grandchildren will be faced with paying off most of these tax cuts will actually be doled out to individuals who do not need more of the governments largesse with american troops in combat in iraq and afghanistan and with our country coping with the rebuilding of the gulf coast all of us all of us must sacrifice for our troops and for our neighbors in addition to suspending tax cuts for wealthy families the congress must immediately restrain its voracious appetite for spending finding places where cuts can be made to pay the costs of katrina and iraq and in addition to making tough cuts the congress should move to immediately reinstate paygo rules to stop any further bleeding finally the congress must establish a rainy day fund for future katrinas so we will not find ourselves in this spot again the interest earned by such a fund could be used for disaster planning and preparedness to modernize our nations infrastructure fortify our levees and to update and makeinteroperable our communications systems the american people now understand the precarious state of the nations finances today our national debt stands at nearly 8 trillion each citizens personal share of that debt is almost 27 000 this is what we bequeath to our children and it conflicts most directly with what my parents taught me and what most of our parents taught all of us that is we leave the country a little better off than we found it in 1989 a new york city real estate developer named seymour durst placed a large national debt clock in times square in order to draw public attention to what he saw as a grim predictor of financial instability for 11 years the debt numbers on the clock rose at the breakneck pace of 13 000 a second in 1995 as the clinton administration began to pay down the national debt onlookers were shocked to see the numbers on that clock not only slow down but reverse the clock was retired in the year 2000 as president clinton announced record reductions in the national debt lir speaker unfortunately no debt clocks were at work this time drawing attention to this crisis it has taken katrina to awaken the nation to the coming fiscal crisis let us hope our response to this crisis is an

a bill to designate the william jefferson clinton birthplace home located in my hometown of hope arkansas as a national historic site and unit of the national park system first i would like to thank chairman pombo chairman saxton and ranking member rahall and ranking member christensen for their support and their assistance in moving this bill from the resources committee in a bipartisan manner to the floor of the united states house of representatives what we have just witnessed from the gentlewoman from florida is an example of the kind of partisan bickering that the people back home are sick and tired of this is not a democrat or republican issue this is about america and it is about our nations history what the gentlewoman from florida obviously does not get is the fact that this is about history we have only had 42 presidents in the history of this nation and i believe all of them democrat and republican alike if their birthplace home is still standing it should be an historic site because it is a part of history i am pleased to have the entire arkansas congressional delegation supporting this bill in a bipartisan manner including congressman boozman from arkansas congressman berry from arkansas congressman snyder from arkansas and i am proud that this bill was passed out of the resources committee and placed on the suspension calendar by our leaders in both parties that recognized it for what it is about history not about politics so i am deeply deeply saddened that one member out of 435 has chosen to try to divide us once again by taking a history lesson and turning it into a partisan ball game in my mind and in the minds of my colleagues from arkansas there is no doubt this important property in hope arkansas deserves federal recognition i believe the preservation of properties of historical significance is a necessary and important function of our government the designation as a national historic site and unit of the national park system will open the doors for further economic opportunities and prosperity for the city of hope and all of southwest arkansas this site will celebrate it will celebrate the history and educate thousands of visitors on the early life of our 42nd president of the united states of america president william jefferson clinton who came into this world on august 19 1946 as william jefferson blythe iii in hope arkansas just 3 months after his father tragically died in a car accident i mentioned that this has bipartisan support this is about economic development it is about tourism it is about history it is about maintaining and protecting and preserving an historic site the birthplace home of the 42nd president of the united states of america our relpublican governor in arkansas gets it and i want to thank him for that and i want to share with my colleagues and make a part of the record a letter i received dated yesterday from our republican governor mike huckabee who too grew up in hope arkansas it says dear congressman ross thank you for your efforts to honor and recognize the birthplace of our 42nd president william jefferson clinton by naming his birthplace in hope arkansas a national historic site as is customary in this country to honor our former presidents with libraries and other accolades i cannot think of a better tribute to president clinton than this recognition the lasting impact this will have for the state and country is immeasurable not only would it provide future generations an educational look into our 42nd president and the times he lived in but it will provide the region of our state and specifically my native home of hope arkansas added economic opportunity and prosperity h r 4192 is an important piece of legislation for not only the reasons mentioned above but also for the preservation and protection of this historical site which is currently reliant upon private donations president clinton will forever be a true arkansan and this piece of legislation will allow not only arkansas but the country the ability to properly honor him and his service again thank you for your work on this legislation i look forward to working with you to see its passage out of congress this year sincerely yours mike huckabee governor of the state of arkansas might i add a republican governor who like myself grew up in hope arkansas finally i would like to atleast read a part of a letter from mack mclarty who was president clintons first white house chief of staff and someone who commanded respect from both sides of the aisle during those early clinton years dear mike im writing today in support of h r 4192 your bill authorizing the secretary of the interior to designate president william jefferson clintons birthplace home in hope arkansas as a national historic site and unit of the national park system this step would be a fitting recognition of president clintons birthplace home in our nations presidential history and ensure the preservation of the site for future generations this site will celebrate history and educate thousands of visitors and perhaps most importantly it will bring jobs and economic development opportunities to southwest arkansas as you know i was born and raised in hope myself my lifelong friendship with president clinton dates back to miss marys kindergarten not surprisingly then my attachment to 117 south hervey street is personal and heartfelt but more than that i believe the clinton birthplace stands for something larger than itself mack mclarty goes on to write that as i wrote some years ago in an essay for the arkansas historic preservation program i believe that white frame house is worthy of more than a nod of nostalgia because the values president clinton learned there and in hope formed the core of his political philosophy in 1946 when president clinton and i were born hope was the essence of smalltown america family and faith were at the center of peoples lives commitment to work was expected from the schools to the churches local businesses and charities knowing and caring for one another was part of daily life and as our friend joe purvis later wrote it bred a sense of responsibility because if you misbehaved your mama knew about it before you got home mack mclarty continues in his letter for a small boy growing up in that era hope lived up to its name we had won the war the economy was booming the american dream was alive people had confidence in a future they believed was theirs to shape it was a time of infectious optimism and seemingly limitless potential i do not mean to suggest that our hometown was perfect we never thought it was even then hope was segregated like the rest of the south it had its share of human frailty and vice but kids were taught growing up to respect the dignity of each individual there was a genuine sense of community in hope that crossed incorhe lines and in many ways race as well mack mclarty continues in his letter in support of this bill the young bill clinton who was then billy blythe understood this perhaps better than most his father had died before he was born his mother determined to pro vide for her son was in nurse anesthetist school in new orleans a brave step ifi an era when single mothers and working women were uncommon young billy was raised those first few years primarily by his grandparents who owned a grocery on north hazel street across from rose hill cemetery i could continue but there are others who want to speak in support of this bill on both sides of the aisle and i applaud them and thank them for helping me restore and maintain and preserve this piece of history as we should do for all 42 former presidents democrat and republican alike"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "as we gather here tonight to talk over the problems of the budget our colleagues on this side of the aisle the rellublicans are locked in a dispute over how to pay for hurricane katrina the cost of which could fall between 100 and 200 billion maybe even more for the federal government alone some for the most part their most conservative members have proposed big cuts in programs that range from student loans to medicaid to food stamps about 50 billion in spending cuts spread over 5 years they present these spending cuts as a way to offset partially at least offset the spending increases that the response to katrina andrita are going to require but in actuality these spending cuts will not go to offset katrina because the republican budget the budget resolution operative for the year 2006 the resolution to be brought to the floor to be amended already calls for 106 billi6n in additional tax cuts 106 billion in new tax cuts and when these new tax cuts are passed the spending cuts proposed ostensibly to offset the cost of katrina will instead go to make up for the loss of revenues due to the 106 billion in tax cuts since the spending cuts are 50 billion and the tax cuts are 106 billion none of the spending cuts will ever make it to the bottom line where they might otherwise be available to offset the cost of katrina so the first problem that we as democrats have with what our republican colleagues are pushing is that it is not what it purports t6 be it is not a plan to pay for katrina it is a plan to facilitate 106 billion in additional tax cuts the second problem that we as democrats have with their plan is that we believe the cost of helping one state sustain the catastrophic loss and cost of a natural disaster a disaster like katrina hurricane rita should be borne by all of us by all of the states should be a matter of shared sacrifice has been in the past should be in future it works and it is right but we do not believe that those least able to bear the costs should be saddled with the lions share of the load and yet that is exactly what their plan will do because they are pushing a plan that will pay fof the cost of katrina by coming down hard and heavy on the backs of students borrowing to pay for their college education on the sick whose only access to care is through medicaid and on the very poor who depend upon food stamps to feed their families this is just some of those on whom the cuts they are proposing will fall and the reason we are proposing alternatives and opposing the plan that they are bringing to the house floor what we have coming before the house is a plan for spending cuts that basically and simply does not achieve its stated purpose because it does not go to cover the cost of hurripane katrina and the spending cuts it does select whether they are used to offset tax cuts or offset the costs of katrina as i have said come down on some of these who are the least able to sustain and bear them it is fair to ask i think as we begin to consider such a program why is it we are insisting upon offsets for rebuilding biloxi or bay st louis or new orleans but not insisting on offsets to pay for rebuilding baghdad or mosul or basra well one of the reasons i believe that we are experiencing this newfound interest in offsets that might diminish the deficit is that the evidence of a swellink deficit that is not going away it is a structural deficit built into the budget not a cyclical deficit deficit based on the ups and downs of the economy one that is going to be with us for a long time to come because of fiscal decisions that were made in 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 is becoming so obvious so widespread so obvious so significant that it simply cannot be denied i mean after all the basics are apparent and they are well known as yogi berra used to love to say you can look it up it is a matter of record back in the year 2000 we had a surplus of 236 billion matter of record the budget was in the black by 236 billion unprecedented that was a budget that was inherited by mr bush today just a few weeks ago as a matter of fact the administration closed the books on fiscal year 2005 and when they closed the books they finally declared the balance at 320 billion and they took some credit because that deficit is actually smaller than the deficit in 2004 which was 412 billion but a 320 billion deficit is nothing to crow about look at what has happened over the last four fiscal years the simplest way to show it to you on the back of an envelope is to look at how many times our republican colleagues have had t vote to increase the debt ceiling of the united states and what those total increases come to since 200t this chart shows it to you very very clearly it shows that in june of 2002 despite the administrations assurance that we would not have tn increase the debt ceiling the legal limit to which the united states can borrow for another 8 years they were back a year later saying we need an increase this year of 450 billion then in may of 2003 they came back and asked for an incredible amount 984 billion you would think that big an increase would take you at least several years this request was approved on may 26 2003 by the summer of 2004 the bush administration was back secretary snow came back hat in hand saying we have just about run through the 984 billion increase you allowed us last year we need another 800 billion increase and before we could leave for the winter break last november that had to be passed finally this year we had a budget resolution on the house floor passed the senate has now been passed as a concurrent budget resolution it calls for an increase of 781 billion in the year 2006 if you add all of these debt ceiling increases together you will see that to accommodate to make room for the budgets of the bush administration over the last four fiscal years we have had to raise the debt ceiling of the united states by 3 trillion 15 billion so why do we have this newfound interest in offsets it is because the budget is becoming undeniably unsustainable i yield to the gentleman from wisconsin"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "catholics have a sacrament the

depend on medicaid and 36 million americans who have to worry about going hungry how do we as a congress reconcile the fact that these cuts will disproportionately affect lowincome americans the elderly and the poor the answer is we should not reconcile ourselves to such an action not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the proposedcuts are robbing the poor of opportunity the reconciliation budget targets programs that work to bridge the gap between rich and poor medicaid food stamps and student loans that strive to even the playing field for all american families eight weeks ago across the united states americans

families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is

world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we as a congress will rise up to defeat it poverty is on the rise in our country 37 million americans are now in poverty i a family of two in povertya single mother with her child is living on 1 069 a month about 14 million americans are living on half of poverty a single mother with her child living at half of poverty is trying to survive on 535 a month that is two people living on 123 37 a week and each day in america 2 385 more babies are born into poverty the republicans will say that society has little obligation to help the poor because they fail to take personal responsibility for their lives the united states has highest gdp in the world we are first in military technology first in military exports first in gross domestic product first in the number of millionaires and billionaires and first in health technology but we rank 12th in living standards among our poorest onefifth 13th in the gap between rich and poor 14th in efforts to lift children out of poverty 18th in the percent of children in poverty and 37th in the health status of our citizens we should be working to close these gaps and ensure that all americans have a fair chance at life and are treated with basic human dignity instead this reconciliation plan will take away food health care education and the abilityto live in dignity in old age from people who have no other options this budget will proliferate existing inequalities i simply cannot reconcile this budget with my values because this budget does not reflect who we are as a nation and what we believe our responsibility is to other americans we will be judged by how we take care of the least of our people we will be judged by our decision to turn our backs on those americans who were driven to cry out helpwe are your neighbors your grandmothers your children i urge my colleagues to vote no on this shortsighted fiscally irresponsible and immoral budget"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "first let me thank my colleague the gentleman from new york for organizing really this opportunity to educate the public and the administration and of course congress with regard to the most pressing issues confronting our country as itrelates to this budget especially as it relates to those who have not benefited from the huge tax cuts few traditions are more significant in our democracy than the presidents annual submission of the budget it provides us really a window on the pres dents and the administrations values and their priorities for this term it also sets the tone and the standard for us in congress by marking the spending levels for this year now i quite frankly had to go back and reread the presidents state of the union speech because i wanted to see how consistent this budget was in terms of what he presented to the country in his state of the union address so i would like to mention a couple of those points tonight first of all of course in his state of the union message he said that one of the deepest values of our country is compassion i think we have heard that tonight this presidents 2006 budget shows very little compassion instead of sending us a budget for the american people for the people this president has sent us a budget that really turns our back on the people and on their future it sacrifices our children our seniors our security our veterans our environment and our economy in order to advance special interests and to make permanent tax cuts for the wealthy in his state of the union speech the president also said over the next several months on issue after issue let us do what americans have always done and builda better world for our children and our grandchildren well let me tell my colleagues how does cutting 5 billion in housing how does eliminating funding for hope vi how does cutting funding by 50 percent for the disabled in terms of housing how does this create a better world for our children and for our grandchildren the assault on the poor in this budget is appalling and the cuts keep coming the presidents budget has cut community development block grants has cut housing assistance for people living with hiv and aids it has cut the lead paint abatement program it cuts the fair housing program it cuts rural housing initiatives it cuts native american housing it cuts the youth build program it has eliminated the empowerment zone and brownfield programs and this is just the tip of the iceberg again going back to the presidents state of the union speech how does this budget build a better world for our children and for our grandchildren also in his state of the union speech the president acknowledged rightfully so the devastatingly high rates of hiv and aids in the african american community and we acknowledge the presidents leadership in calling on congress to reauthorize the ryan white care act during last weeks state of the union speech the president indicated this but again i must say looking at this budget it offers very little for our minority aids initiative he proposes a 10 million increase in the ryan white care act 10 million this is far short of what is needed we need at least 513 million more this year to keep people off of waiting lists and to prevent new infections in short we need a budget that provides a minimum of about 2 6 billion if we are really serious about addressing this hiv and aids crisis here in america a 10 million increase in the ryan white care act really does not signal the seriousness of this crisis furthermore we need more money for the minority aids initiative ever since this president has been in office we have flatfunded the minority aids initiative at 407 million we need at least 610 million this year if the president is really serious again as he said in his state of the union address if he is serious about addressing the hiv aids pandemic in our communitids the budget does not reflect what the president has said in terms of the seriousness of this in our country also in the state of the union the president devoted a large portion of his speech to address social security and as he described it social security is one of americas most important institutions a symbol of trust he said between the generations and that it is headed towards bankruptcy well even if we discount the fact that the president simply is incorrect and i believe he is and many of us do in his assessment about social securitys solvency his budget for 2006 does not even include the cost of his estimated 1 3 trillion proposal for social security privatization over the decade after its enactment this is a critical omission and the president said in his state of the union speech that a taxpayer dollar must be spent wisely or not at all well let me just say parenthetically i believe not only should tax dollars be spent wisely but they should be spent with compassion as he talked about earlier not or not at all but in this budget these cuts that the president has proposed are not even wise let alone compassionate also the presidents state of the union speech was about freedom and democracy very grandiose statements he made but i wondered when i was listening to him why justice as a value why this was omitted really from these grand statements in the state of the union well quite frankly after reading and reviewing this budget i can see why it explains why because there is no justice in this budget so i think we need to go back to the drawing board and we need to remind the president about his state of the union message and i would say as many have said before that we want not just a budget but a just budget"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i am here today to join my colleagues and the nation in recognizing may as asian pacific american

primarily because of unconstitutional gun control amendments added tothe bill in the senate as a firm believer in the second amendment to the united states constitution and an opponent of all federal gun laws i cannot support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls on americans i believe that the second amendment is one of the foundations of our constitutional liberties in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gunstorage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired further the severe penalties for non compliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states second a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess armor piercing bullets just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397 i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering h r 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments notably gun owners of america has written to house members to request that they oppose s 397 and instead support h r 800 last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397 while i am concemed about some of the federalism implications of h r 800 it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices with 258 sponsors and cosponsors h r 800 would easily pass the house the house voting for h r 800 would allow the differences between h r 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee in conference every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original unamended s 397 had 62 senate sponsors and cosponsorsa filibuster proof majority in the senate i regret that under the guise of helping gun owners

all around the coastline of our country he particularly focuses on natural gas and professes that natural gas is a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300

general annan to go to darfur to confirm with his own eyes that the situation has not improved then secretary general annan should make bold recommendations and call on the security council to immediately implement them because a strong meaningful resolution should be put forward and could make a difference it is now time for secretary general annan to use his strong moral leadership he is a nobel peace prize recipient and surely the security council would take his recommendations he should use his power and prestige to plead for the people of darfur and if the security council fails to take meaningful action secretary general annan should resign in protest i am not blaming kofi annan for darfur he does not control the security council but i ask him to use his leadership to demand a new course of action from them i believe these actions could turn the attention of the world back to what is taking place in darfur resigning under protest is an act of great moral leadership and this world would respect his actions great men in history have given up their posts to force change in 1973 at the height of the watergate scandal president nixon ordered attorney general elliott richardson to fire the special prosecutor he refused and resigned in protest and later got the presidential medal of freedom william wilberforce a member of the british parliament he could have been prime minister but spoke out to abolish the slave trade and gave up being prime minister of england anything kofi annan can do to get the world to focus on darfur would be greatly admired if in the year 2005 the security council cannot deal with genocide the raping of women and the systematic burning of villages now occurring then i believe it is fair to ask what purpose is the united nations serving in the 21st century i close by adding that just yesterday the new york times reported that villages continue to burn and that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence in darfur just last week fresh attacks killed over 100 people and drove thousands more from their homes where is the international community something needs to be done now this past weekend i watched the movie hotel rwanda i urge you all to go see it it is a movie about how the world stood by as almost a million people were slaughtered in rwanda the lead actor don cheadle is nominated for an oscar and the movie is nominated as best original screen play no one who sees that movie can leave not thinking about what is happening in darfur i end by asking the question who will play the leading role in hotel

awareness month beginning in may every year in the united states about 1 000 children are born with cystic fibrosis or cf a lifeshortening genetic disease according to the cystic fibrosis foundation those children face a median life expectancy of 36 years an average that fortunately has continued to increase as science and research have developed better treatment and drugs and while a median life expectancy of 36 is unacceptably low that figure is cause for hope for those living with the disease and of course their families they know that in 1955 the year parents of children suffering from this disease formed the cystic fibrosis foundation children born with cf usually did not live to attend preschool as the life expectancy increases those suffering with this disease and their families continue to work for a cure or a lifeextending treatment while a cure for cystic fibrosis remains illusive the symptoms and effects of the disease are fairly simple cf is one of the most common lifethreatening genetic diseases in the united states more than 30 000 people in the united states have cf and over half of them are children in addition over 10 million americans are unknowing symptomfree carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene cystic fibrosis affects the lungs and digestive system e 1500 the defective gene that causes cf triggers the production of abnormally thick mucus in the lungs that leads to restricted breathing recurring lung infections and in many cases digestive problems the infections deteriorate the lungs and their capacity to deliver oxygen to the body a condition that worsens over time and in many cases even leads to death or the need for a lung transplant one of the goals of h con res 357 is to promote the need for early diagnosis and the importance of newborn screening so that treatment of children with cf can begin as soon as possible to improve their health and longevity the five decades that have passed since the founding of the cystic fibrosis foundation have brought not only hope but years to the lives of those suffering from cf the cystic fibrosis foundation continues to be at the forefront of making more with less in the area of drug discovery and development the therapeutics development program tdp created and launched by the cf foundation has pioneered new ways to conduct cuttingedge lifesaving research in a costeffective and efficient manner this program now includes 18 major research institutions across the country in an established clinical trials network the tdp provides innovative companies with funding raised through private donations to the cf foundation to undertake research and development on promising new drug candidates and supports an extensive pipeline of potential new therapies in fact the cf foundation currently has more than 30 drugs and therapies in various stages of clinical trials any one of which could dramatically improve the life of someone suffering from cf i believe that the innovative programs like the therapeutics development program are part of the blueprint for more efficient and costeffective health care and should be supported so as you can see cf foundationsponsored research is adding precious years to the lives of those living with the disease so that they might live long enough to benefit once a cure is found today there is more potential research on new drugs and therapies than funds to finance that lifesaving work this is a problem created by a wealth of scientific riches and one that i hope can be bridged by more publicprivate partnerships which leverage our worldclass biotech and pharmaceutical companies with the capabilities of institutions like the national institutes of health to ensure that the discovery phase of identifying new drugs and compounds to treat cystic fibrosis continues to that end the resolution before us today advocates strong partnerships between government resources like the nih and nonprofits like the cystic fibrosis foundation as a key means to improve care for those with orphan diseases like cf in closing i would like to commend my friend and colleague mr markey from massachusetts for itis leadership and work supporting this resolution and for our partnership cochairing a new congressional cystic fibrosis caucus the congressional cystic fibrosis caucus like this resolution is

proposal to create within the department a directorate dealing just with preparedness and bringing into that agency all of the other agencies of the government federal state and local to help plan so that we will not have another katrina episode makes altogether good sense this was not developed overnight the idea in fact it has been studied by the secretary and the department for many months i want to quote briefly from a letter that i received just this morning from the department from secretary chertoff which says as follows our proposal was formed after intensive consultations with preparedness professionals first responders law enforcement officials the former leadership of the department and state and local stakeholders all of these people were involved in the construction of this idea of creating a massive governmentwide directorate for preparedness planning our objective is to create a stronger capability to do preparedness planning across the full spectrum of all hazards both natural disasters and terrorist attacks continuing to read critically no structural changes were made to fema prior to hurricane katrina katrina was under the old scheme going forward our plan will significantly strengthen the planning and preparedness actions of fema and the entire departmenit by ensuring that a dedicated team will focus on these actions on a fulltime urgent basis our preparedness directorate the secretary says will integrate and leverage the capabilities of fema with those of coast guard tsa transportation security administration the customs agents both on the border and internal and secret service among others fema is and should be a surge organization we have forgotten that fema develops with the surges of the moment when incidents occur every asset of the organization and its entire leadership team surges into the incident our proposal the secretary says for a preparedness organizationsupports femas capacity to surge while maintaining a systematic planning and exercise regime in support of femas mission and that of other dhs components the directorate will aggressively support femas training and exercising needs continuing to read from the secretarys letter it aligns our grantmaking programs and our crucial training and exercising work in support of the departments allhazards mission the directorate will include increased focus on issues broader than fema including infrastructure protection cybersecurity and a new chief medical officer those are not considered today in the present fema we have got to take a look at the broader picture so those are the comments of the secretary now who supports the secretary in bringing a broader perspective to preparedness planning groups like the international association of fire chiefs if there is a first responder organization that typifies what they do it is the fire departments and the fire chiefs the people who know best about preparing for disasters they say this is a critical change that is necessary and i am quoting from their letter to that effect this preparedness directorate must be a new function and must be separate and distinct from operational functions although it must coordinate with those operational functions quoting further from the international association of fire chiefs currently the unitedstates fire administration is located within the emergency preparedness and response directorate unfortunately the preparedness functions of the usfa are diminished because ep r is frequently focused on the operational response to disasters that makes sense they go on to say it is critical that fire chiefs or other senior fire service leaders be included in this directorate along with other state local and tribal first responders so that they may provide essential perspective in the creation of policy for dhs and not only in the review or enactment of policy this putsthe fire chiefs in the middle of the planning process not at the other end they are not being told what to do they are being asked what to do with this proposal if members vote for the sabo motion they are saying to the fire chiefs we do not care about you we will tell you what to do we do not want you to tell us how we should do it before we do it we want to bring them into the planning process not tell them what to do at the end of the process in bringing about this directorate the department of the secretary over months went out and talked to all sorts of people and organizations i will give some examples and i have got three pages here of the listing of some of the people they have talked to lee baca the sheriff of l a county matt bettenhausen director of the california office of homeland security roger vanderpool director arizona department of public safety art

associations of chiefs of police and i could go on so here is a list a brief list of some of the people contacted by the department as they came up with this idea to consolidate preparedness planning in a single place encompassing all of the agencies of the federal state and local governments people like the fire chiefs and chiefs of police from the major cities chiefs association a letter saying law enforcement across the nation supports the presidents position that the best way to prepare for a terrorist attack is to stop it from happening we feel that the department should unify the components that share this common mission at present the prevention and protection grants plans and intelligence are each in separate agencies long overdue the nation would be well served by dhs directorate committed solely to protecting the american people for the first time the chiefs of police say local law enforcement could work with a single dhs directorate focused on our common goal to protect the american people from another terrorist attack chiefs of police fire chiefs first responders state and local directors of homeland security all say the same thing we have got to consolidate

subcommittee and in fact the ranking member of international terrorism and nonproliferation subcommittee i am well aware of the conflict of two goals of the federal government one of those is to meet our obligations to the international space station the other is to use every device possible to try to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons and to try to prevent russia from assisting in that process for me these goals are not of equal weight the supreme goal and objective and obligation of the federal government is to protect our people iranian nuclear weapons could be smuggled into our cities and i would say that we should adopt no legislation and leave on the books current law that puts one objective and that is limiting iranian nuclear weapons as the sole objective that is embodied in our statutes but in fact some balance is going to be struck and it is not going to be the overwhelming balance that i would strike a balance in favor of doing everything possible to limit iranian nuclear weapons development and giving far less weight to meeting our international space station obligations i want to take this opportunity to commend the ranking member and the chairman of the committe6 on international relations and of the committee on science and the gentleman from california for doing a very good job of trying to narrowly tailor this legislation to try to balance those two goals in not the way i would but in a way that i have to concede is reasonable and for that rea son i will not ask for a recorded vote on this bill i recognize that if this bill does not pass in this form it is as likely to get worse as it is to get better because in fact my colleagues have labored very effectively and have taken some input from me to create a bill which is tailored to the twin objectives now i would hope the day would come when the president of the united states could certify to this nation that russia is doing everything possible to help us prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons and in any case was not helping iran to develop those terrible weapons but until that day comes present law says that we cannot contract with agencies of the russian

exception to present law it allows nasa to contract with russian government space agencies only when those agencies are the only available seller of goods and services necessary to meet our obligations to the international space station there are two important aspects of that understanding one is the language that i said the only available seller of essential goods and services that is to say this bill does not authorize us to turn a blind eye to russian space agency cooperation with the nuclear plans of tehran just because the russian space agency is the cheapest or the most convenient or a few days faster it allows us to ignore those important iran nonproliferation goals only when it is absolutely necessary and only when necessary to meet our own obligations to the space station not obligations of other countries to reiterate not only is this bill limited to situations where it is necessary not merely convenient for us to contract with the russian space agency but it is also a requirement that we are meeting our obligations to the international space station not a circumstance when we are paying the russians to meet their own obligations or the obligations of some other country so i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and to put it in context i think this bill does a good job of striking what is the best balance we are likely to see in this

properly and this bill helps address that to make sure that precious time is not lost in assembling mine rescue teams this bill makes sure that every mine has at least two mine rescue teams that can
