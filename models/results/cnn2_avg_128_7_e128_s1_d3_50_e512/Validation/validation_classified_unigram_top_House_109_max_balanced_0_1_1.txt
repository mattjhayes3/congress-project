{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "19 years ago i came to congress to fight aids a disease that has taken nearly 18 000 lives in my city of san francisco alone we have lost friends family and loved ones but we have not lost our will to fight this terrible disease this year we mark the 25th anniversary of the first diagnosis of aidsa stark reminder that this epidemic is still among us ahd that our work is not done yet as we grieve for those we have lost we are filled with hope a~s we see the strength of those who are fighting and living full lives with hiv and aids this would not be possible without the help of the federal government through initiatives such as the ryan white care act the act has been instrumental in our fight to defeat aids it has greatly improved the quality and availability of health care services for people living with and affected by hiv and aids i was proud to be a part of the creation of the ryan white care act unfortunately i must rise in opposition to this reauthorization there are a number of good provisions in this bill including the recognition of emerging communities and the use of actual living aids counts rather than estimated living aids cases that change will benefit many communities including my constituents in san francisco however when it comes to meeting the needs of people living with aids our mantra should be the same as the physicians who care for all patients first do no harm the primary problem with this legislation is that it fails to provide adequate funding for the treatment of hiv aids patients had this administration and the republicancontrolled congress made a priority of funding the ryan white program over the last several years i would be standing here in strong sup port of this bill but they have not and i cannot support this bill yet funding in this bill simply wont be able to meet the current demand for hiv aids care in the united states under this reauthorization san francisco with the highest per capita caseload of people living with aids in the country stands to lose almost 30 million over the next 5 years that is a far cry from the bipartisan consensus we were able to achieve on this issue between 1993 and 2001 during that time fundingadjusted for both inflation and caseload growthunder the ryan care act increased by 70 percent since 2001 funding has declined by 35 percent the problem is not that one part of the country gets too much money and some other parts of the country are left behind instead peoplesuffering from this diseaseand those caring for themare being forced to compete for pieces of an evershrinking pie if funding for this act had simply kept pace with the number of people with aids and inflation my city and all other cities and states would be getting increases in funding instead of grappling with how they can stretchand where they will have to sacrificein meeting the growing demand for services in fact the impact of the cuts will be compounded because in san francisco these funds form the basis for matching funds from the city due in no small part to this federal state and local investment more people are living with hiv and aids now than dying from it that is remarkable as the epicenter of the epidemic san francisco has experienced terrible loss of lifebut from that loss my city has created a standard of care that has been a model for the nation but our problem has not gone away there are more people living with aids in the san franciscos area than at any point in the epidemics history this legislation has farreaching implications for the stability of hiv aids funding in our state and cities the programs funded by the ryan white care act have literally been lifesavers for people who live with hiv aids it has provided critical support to the cities that have been the center of the epidemic and to states that have been funding critical drug and support programs to treat the disease this cut in funding to san francisco means a loss in services for patients receiving primary medical care a lack of access to counseling support outreach services transitional and emergency housing and emergency payments for health care costs where do these people go what do we tell them when their ability to receive support to fight hiv aids is cut off in prior reauthorizations of the ryan white care act the changes that have been made were made at the margins in order to deal with emerging problems and developments these changes did not however disrupt an initiative that was working unlike those past reauthorizations this bill would have a drastic destabilizing effect on many of the hardesthit areas of the country including california a basic goal of this reauthorization must be to ensure that the actions we take do not destabilize systems already in place unfortunately the bill fails to meet this goal and jeopardizes the critical funding of areas throughout the country in general and the state and cities of california in particular in addition the bill prematurely incorporates hiv reporting into the allocation formula eliminates the hold harmless provision just when san francisco and california need it the most and allows the administration to devise and implement a whole new funding formula without congressional approval it is for these reasons i must oppose this bill and i will submit the entirety of my statement for the record the second major problem with this legislation is that there is simply no way to incorporate data on hiv cases into the funding formula on a consistent and comparable basis across jurisdictions the 2000 reauthorization of the act included a requirement that hiv cases be incorporated into the funding distribution by no later than 2007 at that time hiv reporting systems were in various stages of development across the country although some states and cities had been reporting hiv cases by name since 1985 others had yet to implement an hivreporting system at all given this landscape the drafters understood the need to provide sufficient time to allow states and cities to begin collecting hiv cases at the time they believed seven years to be adequate for such a transition as it turns out it was not as hiv reporting systems were developed variations among these systems across jurisdictions emerged some areas reported hiv by the individuals name along with other identifying information others like california as a means of protecting the individuals confidentiality opted not to report the persons name at all and instead included only a unique code identifying the individual the 2000 reauthorization of the ryan white act did not specify which type of reporting system jurisdictions were required to use and nothing in the law prohibited this kind of variation so long as the secretary found that the data on hiv cases was sufficiently accurate and reliable jurisdictions were free to report cases by name or by code thus whether an area began collecting hiv by name or by code they were on equally solid ground under the law it was not until december 2005 that cdc first gave a clear indication that it would deem only cases reported by name to be sufficiently accurate and reliable in a letter to all codebased states cdc set forth its strong recommendation that those states convert their systems to namesbasedit did not however establish any sort of legal requirement at that point 13 states used some form of a codebased reporting system in response to cdcs announcement almost all codebased states began the process of converting their hiv reporting systems to namesbased systems the reported bill would rely exclusively on namesbased hiv and aids cases in making funding allocations starting in fiscal year 2011 in order to meet this deadline and have all of their namesbased hiv cases counted for funding purposes codebased jurisdictions will be required to have completely converted to namesbased systems in less than 3 years for large and diverse codebased states with several very large cities like california this is simply not enough time to make this change california essentially has to start from scratch in its codebased system california currently has approximately 40 000 cases of hiv nonaids under california law these cases cannot simply be retallied under the new namesbased system in order to incorporate these cases into the new system the state must contact each of these 40 000 individuals and ask them to come in to a testing site to be retested some of these individuals are homeless some are drugabusers many dont speak english when personnel and resources are already strained california will simply not be able to get all of these individuals entered into the namesbased system in 3 years the experience of other large codebased systems provides a sense of the difficulty of this task new york for example converted to a namesbased system in 2000 and is now considered by cdc to be mature however it is widely acknowledged that new yorks current namesbased hiv count severely undercounts the true burden of hiv in the state simply because it has not had enough time to find and report all of its hiv cases i cannot support legislation that would disadvantage my state and city and take large amounts of dollars away simply because the data system is incomplete the number of persons with hiv and with need for services remains they should not lose needed services because of an unrealistic data requirement under the language of the proposal it is also unclear on what basis the funds will be allocated gao and the state of california both of which have modeled the bill have quite different case counts for the same state and city the proposed language says codebased numbers are used to determine funding allocations hrsa numbers used by gao in their estimates are not codebased numbers those numbers purport to show neednot any scientific way of counting cases and a method which surely varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction depending on how much the grantee estimated what assurance is there that the gao numbers will be used to allocate funds in fiscal year 2007 and the out years this does not pass the test of good govemment under the proposed language the case count used in 2010 and 2011 in making the allocation to san francisco will be substantially less than the actual number of hiv positive individuals who currently live in san francisco that simply is unfair and is not good policy because hiv reporting systems across the country remain in a state of flux it is critical that this reauthorization protect against severe losses in funding whenthe bill requires that the funding be based on hiv cases the most effective way to accomplish this protection is to incorporate a holdharmless provision for the entire life of the bill unfortunately the current bill protects a jurisdictions funding for only the first 3 years this is not enough california faces the most drastic cuts at the very time the hold harmless under the bill comes to an end by californias estimates the state stands to lose nearly 25 percent of its total ryan white care act funding during the 5th year of the bill alone our state simply cannot sustain these kinds of losses in year 5 when transition to namesbased reporting becomes mandatory california and all other jurisdictions moving to namesbased reporting will lose substantially the amount of loss is difficult to ascertain because it will depend entirely upon how quickly california and other jurisdictions can transition to namesbased reporting the elimination of the hold harmless will have a devastating impact on the provision of hiv aids services in san francisco the hold harfrnless was adopted to protect the epicenters of this disease from experiencing drastic reductions in care funding from year to year that would disrupt the systems of care in place and eliminating it now would cause this very consequence as you may know the city of san francisco consistently has invested local funds into the fight against this disease and the care of those living with hiv aids san francisco has been conscientiously preparing to absorb cuts as a result of the eventual loss of the hold harmless but the more than onethird cut in funding proposed is punitive and will eliminate critical care for thousands of people living with hiv aids finally i cannot support the bills inclusion of the socalled severity of need index soni the bill requires the secretary to develop a soni to measure the relative needs of individuals living with hiv aids but fails to specify the factors that should be incorporated into this index leaving it entirely up to the secretary further the bill then permits the secretary to completely discard the current funding formula and distribute funding on the basis of this soni beginning as early as fy 2011 without congressional action this is unacceptable congressnot the administrationshould be solely responsible for making such a drastic shift in the way funds are distributed under the act"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "295 staff sergeant david j weisenburg 296

time again the democrats want to put these fiscal restraints in place so it doesnt matter if there is a republican congress or a democratic congress the rules are in place these rules were in place all throughout the nineties that is why we had surplus money that is why we made the targeted investments focused in certain areas that yield results that yield tax money investments in education you get a good return on that we had a study done at the university of akron a few years back this was on state tax money in ohio but when the state spent 1 on tax money that went towards higher education they got 2 back in taxes education is a great investment lets make this investment lets invest and do it in a way that we can get a good return on our money down the line but today the republican congress has just been tied up in knots with the special interests the oil companies the energy companies the health care industry time and time again they are given public tax dollars in the form of corporate welfare stop the corporate welfare stop the corporate welfare and lets move forward but i want to say that it is not me it is not me it is pat toomey it is newt gingrich it is a lot of the conservatives or some of the conservatives that are still left on the republican side all we want to do is get this country back together because where we are getting the money because we are running deficits how do you plug the hole you got to go borrow it the republican congress continues to borrow from the chinese government from the japanese government from opec countries this is really happening this is one of the k street fairy tales this is like a k street fairy tale the republican majority is borrowing money as we run these deficits and they give millionaires tax cuts 42 000 they are going to give them more next year as they do that and we run these huge budget deficits we cant fill the gap so this republican congress and this republican president they are going to opec to borrow money from opec to help plug the hole can you imagine it is like you are making it up it is another k street fairy tale that we have here running huge deficits gas is 3 a gallon you not only give the oil companies 16 3 billion in corporate subsidies but you also borrow money from opec countries to help plug the deficit because you are giving tax cuts to millionaires now i am not opposed to giving middle class people a tax cut i am not opposed to giving a small business a tax cut but i am against giving a millionaire 42 000 back when you are fighting two wars your average people are struggling tuition costs have doubled in the last 5 years and you are giving bill gates another tax cut that just doesnt make any sense i dont care what your party affiliation is that is irresponsible that is irresponsible governing and until we get the republican congress out and the democratic congress in we are not going to be able to fix this thing because we have tried mr spratt has tried mr

whose side they are on now one may say ms jacksonlee and i am glad that those of us here in the 30something working group we do our homework before we come to the floor i cant say that about all members that come to the floor as it relates to having the facts because what is important here is the truth facts where people can follow up and not fiction and folks are not used to that out of this majority and not used to that here in washington dc and that is what we are saying we want to provide because nothing is better than the truth because no matter what party you are affiliated with we still salute one flag thanks to our men and women that were in uniform veterans and those that are in uniform now the least that we can do is be straight withthem and being straight with them is basically just saying just recently june 22 here on this floor democrats worked to raise the minimum wage and this was appealing to the rule of the chair by mr rangel in a motion to offer the minimum wage increase and he was ruled out of order and it was appealed and then the republicans voted against us from having it on the floor by 229 votes to 195 and that is rollcall vote 313 again june 27 which is a couple of days from the first time from that attempt that we moved to get the minimum wage up the science state justice commerce appropriations bill when it was here on this floor ms jacksonlee you were here that day i saw you the rule to block consideration of the obeyhoyermollohan amendment to increase the minimum wage rollcall vote 319 the rule was adopted but there was a procedural move to block us from getting this on the floor the house adopted a resolution to adjourn for the fourth of july recess without bringing up the bill to increase the minimum wage that is rollcall vote to adjourn which was rollcall vote 353 to adjourn and i think it is important that was 220 supermajority voted for it 197 voted against it it was only one republican that was on our side and saying that we shouldnt leave until we deal with it so ms jacksonlee i wouldnt get concerned about what they say because that is what speaker gingrich has said he has the chart and if staff can give me the chart that said they that they that is what he calls the republican majority that is what they called the republican majority you remember that mr ryan because he felt that they are no longer responsible in a way that he thought they should be when he was the father of giving case in point once again thirdparty validator this was the speaker of the house when the republicans took control of the house and this is what he has to say and this was in the knight ridder newspaper friday march 31 2006 they are seen by the country as being in charge of a government that cant function they he is talking about the republican majority they goodness gracious if speaker foley came and called us they i mean this would be a travesty this is newt gingrich this is not someone in some club somewhere or someone that doesnt have house credentials he was here on this floor he was the speaker he was the leader in the republican majority and he was the speaker he wasnt majority leader he wasnt a whip he wasnt over the conference he wasnt over a caucus he was the speaker he sat there on the speaker rostrum he was the man his picture hangs up back here in the speakers lobby i cant boil this down any further to say that it is substantial when a chief republican says they and so what we are talking about here ms jacksonlee and mr ryan is something that everyone should understand republicans have to have a problem republican voters and independent voters and democratic voters have to have a problem with a dysfunctional government that is making history in all the wrong ways

back but the bottom line is somebody appointed him to that position with no experience whatsoever it is like me leaving this room leaving this floor and saying to the gentleman from ohio well you know i am going to carry out open heart surgery i know nothing about it but i stayed in a holiday inn express last night you do not get qualifications based upon we need to fill a position not a fema position that played around and finally the administration took him out under pressure not only pressure from the democratic leader but from the media who started focusing on him saying things were going poorly because we still do not have good leadership there he came back to washington and he resigned then we called for this 9 11 commissionlike legislation to pass to make sure that this never happens again never happens again not natural disasters we have no control over that that is an act of god but when it comes down to governance and responsibility and making sure if you are poor middle class or wealthy in this country that this government will govern on your behalf and that did not happen the response to that request was we are going to put together a select committee we are going to make sure that there is a majority influence on it as relates to the republican leadership side and we will not get to the bottom of what happened will we have a lot of show and a lot of folks getting excited in the select committee i am pretty sure they will have it but what i am saying independent individuals i am talking about people who understand emergency management individuals who understand weather regular citizens from the affected areas regular citizens were on the 9 11 commission a democratic and republican appointment cochairs to look at this and professionalize our response on all levels that will not happen not right now i think it is important that the american people members of congress no matter what community you represent if you believe in making sure that people get the same representation for us to have a 9 11 commission and i must add and say to the gentleman from ohio and we come to the floor to talk about what we should be doing and how we should be doing it or what we are doing on this side of the aisle it is important for us to know the facts this is the same congress in the majority that the 9 11 families came up here and they voted down two opportunities to set up a 9 11 commission this is the same congress until it just became overbearing that there were major mistakes in our intelligence major mistakes and flags and they are still finding stuff because of the 9 11 commission that could have saved lives better yet we came to this floor the 9 11 bill came to the floor and we have better intelligence better communications between federal local and state agencies because of their work it is one of the best pieces of legislation that has passed this floor so now the difference between the 9 11 families and what has happened down in the south is the fact that these individuals are poor that they are still in the recovery process and they have not been heard from yet they have not been heard from i think it is important that we give those individuals voice i am not saying just democrats that are concerned about individuals that are affected in affected areas i am talking about members of congress giving them voice to allow them to not ever go through this again and also make sure that they do not become victims when we have contractors with no restraints nobid contracts they can run the tab up to whatever they can run it up to and then the president is going to waive davisbacon which allow the people in the recovery process to receive minuscule wages not what they would ordinarily get from federal procured work i think it is important the differences a coming back here in session it would have happened without hesitation if democrats were in the majority b michael brown would have gone to another job long before because the pressure and there probably would have been a vote to remove the director putting pressure on the white house to get someone more qualified c we would have a 9 11type commission appointed today to start pulling itself together to do the work and make sure this never happened began d the procurement issue it would not be an issue because there would be proper oversight these are very serious issues the only reason i am saying democratic leadership versus republican leadership because that is exactly the direction we are going in now the votes that are going down here are partisan votes not votes on behalf of what we know we are not talking about a truman commission or something that happened 20 or 40 something years ago we are talking about a 9 11 commission that is still doing its work and it is the same administration and the same majority side in congress i am asking for the members of this house on both sides of the aisle and for the american people not to give up on these poor people that is the bottom line do not give up on them they are not giving up on us the american people community after community are taking care of the evacuees taking care of these americans but we need to make sure that the government that they pay taxes to that their children are fighting in a war for making sure that they are not left behind because they do not have the

it is important for us to take a look at where we are today and how exactly we got here in the congress i think for the most part and certainly a lot of recent polls indicate it the american people are fed up with the congress that the approval rate of congress is at its lowest point in 10 years and it leads me to wonder how did we get to this place i think we have to take a look back at the first 5 months of the 109th congress this year to get some answers earlier this year the republican leadership went ahead and changed the way the committee on standards of official conduct does its business in the past whenever ethics changes were being considered they were addressed in a bipartisan fashion with both democrats and republicans at the table and that is the only way ethics reform can honestly be addressed but the republican leadership ignored that protocol and strongarmed enough of their members to pass new and weakened ethics rules without any support from our democratic colleagues i think the american people understood that these new ethics rules were basically a blatant attempt by the majority to protect one of their republican leaders these new rules allowed either party democrat or republican to protect its own members under the new republican rules if a majority of the committee could not determine whether or not an investigation should proceed after 45days of receiving a complaint that complaint would simply be dropped since the committee on standards of official conduct is made up of five members from each party either side could prevent an ethics investigation from moving forward against one of its members that is not the way the committee on standards of official conduct is supposed to work under the old bipartisan rules which have now been restored an investigative committee was created after a 45day deadline if a majority of the committee could not determine how to proceed the weakened ethics rules by house republicans did not fool anybody certainly not the editorial writers around the country both liberal and conservative they followed the house proceedings closely and they were essentially fed up with the new republican rules i will just give you some examples the conservative chicago tribune said how do house republicans respond to ethical lapses by trying to bury them the hartford current wrote the committee has been careening towards ethical oblivion in recent years as the majority republicans have relaxed the standards eased up on investigations and created trap doors through which alleged transgressors could escape finally i cite the sarasota herald tribune whichwrote if the gops leaders in congress continue to change the rules to protect one of their own they will have ceded the ethical high ground they pledged to take in 1994 again this is what i call the republican abuse of power and it is a major reason why people have lost faith in congress and why congress is at a 10year low in terms of peoples support or feelings about the institution but the republican leadership did not just stop at weakening the committee on standards of official conduct rules no the leadership also purged three republican members of the committee on standards of official conduct earlier this year three members who ruled against a republican leader the previous year after losing his chairmanship on the committee on standards of official conduct the republican gentleman from colorado told the washington post that there is a bad perception out theie that there was a purge in the ethics committee knd that people were put in that would protect our side of the aisle better than i did he continues nobody should be there to protect anybody they should be there to protect the integrity of the institution it took congressional republicans nearly 4 months to finally listen to their former ethics chairman and the media but fortunately in the end they did restore the old bipartisan ethics rules the gentleman from colorado was clearly right the integrity of the house is much more important than any one member and i think it is time the republican leadership learn that lesson not only on that committee on standards of official conduct issue but in general the abuses of power by the republican majority really make you wonder why they are necessary now it seems clear to me that the republican leadership went to all this trouble to protect one of its leaders the wall street journal charged there is an odor an unsavory whiff at the highest reaches of the house of representatives every single day it seems the members of this body and the american people are subjected to another revelation of questionable actions by one of our colleagues it is a constant drip that is getting close to a large puddle fortunately as i said the american people were not fooled by this abuse of power by the republican majority with the ethics process they saw the new rules for what they were nothing more than an attempt to protect a powerful republican leader and finally after media and public outcry became too much for the republican majority to endure republicans agreed to reinstitute the old bipartisan ethics rules however it is important to remember that had the public been indifferent and had the democrats on the committee on standards of official conduct gone ahead and allowed the committee to organize under the weakened rules today this house would be structured under ethics rules that would allow either side democrat or republican to shield its members from scrutiny the republican ethics reversal was good for this institution and good for the american people now there are still a lot of questions remaining about what the republican majority is doing with the committee on standards of official conduct despite the majority change of heart on weakening the ethics rules there are still several areas where the republican leadership is continuing to delay any action by the committee on standards of official conduct the new chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct has said that he wants to appoint his chief of staff from his personal office to be the new staff director of the committee on standards of official conduct this action would defy house rules which state that committee on standards of official conduct staffers are to be nonpartisan it is inconceivable that the rules would allow the chairman to unilaterally appoint a chief counsel without immediately running afoul of the rules trying to do so would be a clear violation of the rules as well as an affront to the committees tradition the committee on standards of official conduct is supposed to be a place where members can get straight unbiased trustworthy ethics guidance how can members who might have disagreements with the house leadership feel comfortable going to the committee for advice if they fear committee staff members are incapable of performing their official duties in a nonpartisan fashion my point is that the committee on standards of official conduct should be a politicsfree zone one way to ensure politics stops at the committee doors is to hire staff whose first loyalty is to the ethics rules of the house and second loyalty is in equal measure to the chairman ranking member and remaining members of the committee if committee staff are perceived as being loyal to or owing their position to only one member of the committee their ability to render advice and investigate sensitive ethics issues will be called into question i would say once again the american public see the games the republican leadership is playing with the committee on standards of official conduct and they simply do not like it they would rather see this committee go back to work in a bipartisan fashion and now so the congress can address their concerns now i want to go from the one issue of abuse of power here in the house related to the committee on standards of offic ial conduct to the other outrageous abuse of power in the other body in the senate and this relates of course to the senate filibuster senate republicans have spent mjich of the last 4 months fixating on seven extreme judges president bush once again sent up for confirmation after they had already been rejected during his first term rather than dealing with rising gas prices and an economy that continues to falter and other issues that people really care about senate republicans attempted to have a power grab unlike any other in the history of the unitedstates senate fortunately the republican quest for absolute power in washington was temporarily halted last night by 14 senators and this was a truly bipartisan group seven democrats and seven republicans came together to save the senate from moving forward with an extreme power grab that would have undermined the very checks and balances that have existed in our nation for over 200 years senator frist and the senate republican leadership were prepared to wage an unprecedented political power grab on the filibuster they wanted to change the senate rules in the middle of the game and wanted to attack our historic system of checks and balances with the filibuster so that they could ram through a small number of judicial nominees who otherwise could not achieve a consensus in reality the power grab by the senate republican leadership in trying to eliminate the filibuster did not really have much to do probably with the current judicial nominees but instead it was an attempt by the white house and conservative interest groups to clear the way for a supreme court nominee eventually who would only need 51 votes rather than 60 conservative interest groups and a large majority of senate republicans are not happy with the current makeup of the unitedstates supreme court they do not want to see another david souder or anthony kennedy nominated to the supreme court even though they both were confirmed with nearly unanimous bipartisan support they would prefer to see president bush nominate a supreme court justice like clarence thomas who because of extreme views could not garner strong bipartisan support in justice thomass case he only received 52 votes and he has proven to be an extremist if the senate had proceeded with this power grab and gotten rid of the filibuster president bush would have been able to appoint rightwing judges to the supreme court the president has already said he most admires justices scalia and thomas and i think it would be frightening to think of another justice with that same mold at the end of the day a group of 14 bipartisan senators kept the senate republican leadership from moving forward with this extreme power grab the bipartisan compromise that was reached last night shows that president bush is not going to be able to ignore the moderate views of these senators when he appoints future justices to the supreme court and i think that is certainly good news for our country i think certainly what was happening here was that the white house was manufacturing a crisis with these judicial nominees the american people know that there was absolutely no reason for the senate to take the measure of eliminating the minoritys right for input on judicial nominees the white house has essentially manufactured this judicial crisis because if you look at the record over the past 4 years the senate has confirmed 208 of mr bushs judicial nominations and turned back only 10 that is a 95 percent confirmation rate higher than any other president in modern times including presidents reagan the first president bush and president clinton in fact it is thanks to these confirmations that president bush now presides over the lowest court vacancy rate in 15 years despite what senate republicans are saying today judicial nominees have not always received an upordown vote on the senate floor in fact back in 2000 it was senate republicans that attempted to filibuster two of president clintons appointments to the ninth circuit court senator frist the architect of course of eliminating the filibuster now voted to continue a filibuster of a clinton nominee richard paez there are also other ways the senators can prevent a nominee from receiving an upordown vote on the floor and this has happened many times in the past which shows why it is not the case that there has to be an upordown vote judicial nominees have often been stalled in the senate committee on the judiciary more than onethird of president clintons appeals court nominees never received an upordown vote on the floor of the senate because senator hatch then the chairman of the committee on the judiciary refused to bring the nominees names up for a vote in the committee and i think it is extremely disingenuous of senator frist to say that all nominees are entitled to an upordown vote when he himself helped senate republicans block president clintons nominees in the late 1990s we did not hear him talking about an upordown vote then when president clinton was nominating judges i just want to say once again i think that the bipartisan agreement reached last night was extremely valuable it will keep two of the presidents nominees from moving forward who really do not deserve to be appointed and i would hope that the president would learn from last nights action that unlike the house the senate is not a chamber that will be a rubber stamp for his extreme views let us hope that president bush was listening and will resist nominating extreme rightwing judges to our courts in the future but all of this not only the action in the house on the ethics rules but also the action in the senate bn the filibuster i think they are examples really of how the republican majority has abused its power and the consequence of that is that the public is icreasingly disappointed and feels that the congress does not do its job that it is essentially a donothing congress and as we approach the memorial day recess i think i need to stress that that i believe the reason why the polling and the media shows that people no longer have faith in congress or that the support of congress as an institution has dropped significantly is because of the republican leaderships fixation on these issues that consolidate their power that seek to consolidate their power without focusing on the real issues that affect the american people a usa today cnn poll that was released today showed that the american people are fed up with republican control of congress and are ready for a democratic congress and who can blame them if they had been watching the abuses of power that had been taking place in both the house and the senate in the last four months they would have to be disgusted beyond that disgust i think it is clear that they just want congress to address the issues of importance in their lives and we are going to be going into a memorial day recess without most of those issues being addressed it really has been for the last five months a donothing congress for five months now congressional republicans have done nothing to reverse their abysmal economic record the fact is that middle class families are being squeezed at the gas pump at the pharmacy with high drug prices and in the grocery store there are growing signs of a faltering economy with president bush still having the worst jobs record in history instead of addressing the serious kitchen table issues of american families education health care you name it republicans are focusing on legislation that is written for the special interests and will actually harm middle class families instead of increasing the minimum wage and expanding prosperity republicans are focused on undercutting bipartisan ethics rules instead of creating good jobs with good paychecks by completing the muchdelayed highway bill for example republicans choose to focus instead on undercutting the checks and balances on judicial nominations by focusing on the filibuster instead of enacting an energy bill that improves our communities and brings down gas prices and tries to create more energy independence the republicans have channeled their energy into replacing social security with a risky privatization scheme that clearly most americans do not support and the president probably is going to have to eventually abandon and instead of passing a budget that reflects the values of americas families republicans brought the entire federal government to intervene in the personal tragedy of just one family and i am of course talking about the terry schiavo case i think it is no wonder that the american people are not pleased with congress and i think it is time congressional republicans take a hard look at these polls i do not say that we should always be looking at polls but in this case the polls reflect what people are thinking i go back and i will of course go back to my district during the memorial day recess and i know i am going to hear from people who are saying why are you not talking about health care why are you not talking about education what are you doing about the trade deficit what are you doing about the budget deficit what is the reason why a crisis for everything from housing to groceries to gas continue to go up and we in congress do not address the issues i am simply saying that the republican leadership should listen to their constituents the polls reflect i think what our constituents are telling us i think the american people really want these abuses of power to stop they do not want to hear us talking about the filibuster and about the ethics process not that those are not important they are in terms of the procedures and how we proceed but in each of these cases the republicans wanted to change the procedure here so that they could get their own way and instead of concentrating on those procedural issues and trying to change the rules they should get down and look at issues like the rising cost of college the rising cost of health care the rising price of gas at a time when most peoples wages are shrinking it is simply time i think for us to get down to the peoples business i hope that when we come back after the memorial day recess that we can see the end of these republican abuses of power we can see the end of their trying to change the rules and rather focusing in a bipartisan way on trying to address some of the americans concerns of the american people"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "before we went to war president bush and other administration officials made three promises to the american people one we would find weapons of mass destruction two we would be welcomed as liberators and three the reconstruction of iraq would payfor itself well all three promises proved to be false today i will focus on the reconstruction effort in iraq and the massive waste fraud and abuse that have undermined our efforts stuart bowen is the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction he often talks about the reconstruction gap which is the chasm between the presidents promises and reality mr bowen is absolutely right the gap is enormous but it is dwarfed by the incompetency and corruption gaps in iraq the consequences of mismanagement and corruption are serious waste fraud and abuse have flourished the taxpayer has been repeatedly gouged iraq is not being rebuilt we have lost credibility and are now viewed in iraq as occupiers and our troops did not get essential equipment when they needed it we have now spent 50 billion on iraq reconstruction including 30 billion from unitedstates taxpayers lets look at what we got for the money despite spending 2 billion iraqs oil production is still well below prewar levels running about a half million barrels below 2003 levels we have invested 4 billion into improving electricity generation not only is the administration 2 000 megawatts short of reaching its goal for peak output but generation is actually below prewar levels and we spent 6 billion on oil production and electricity generation and we have actually lost ground the situation is the same for drinking water in essence we have squandered 50 billion profiteering has been rampant and the taxpayer has gotten gouged and the work has not gotten done and what is especially shameful about the wasteful spending is that we needed this money for our troops when we first went into iraq our troops did not have enough body armor families had to purchase armor off the internet and ship it to iraq in a desperate attempt to protect their loved ones on congressional delegations individual servicemembers have taken our staffs aside and begged for more night vision goggles patriotic americans even had to donate their frequent flier miles so troops who were dumped at the baltimore airport by the pentagon could make it home for the holidays this should never have happened it is inexcusable that our troops face desperate shortages of essential gear while billions of dollars were frittered away to understand the magnitude of this there is no better place to start than halliburton halliburton is the largest private contractor operating in iraq the company has three contracts that total more than 20 billion we now know that political appointees not career civil servants decided to give halliburton a secret nobid contract for 7 billion to operate iraqs oil fields as gao has reported the key decision that led to the award of the secret contract violated federal procurement law when a career attorney properly objected he was simply overruled and despite statements from the vice president we know now that his chief of staff scooter libby was personally briefed on this entire plan months before the war the decision to give those lucrative contracts to halliburton has been expensive according to pentagon audits halliburtons total unreasonable and unsupported charges exceed 1 4 billion well the examples of waste fraud and abuse are numerous halliburton charged 45 for a case of soda 100 for a 15pound bag of laundry when they had brandnew 85 000 halliburton trucks they abandoned them or torched them if they got a flat tire or experienced minor mechanical problems halliburtons contracts are costplus that means that halliburton is reimbursed for all of its costs and then receives an extra percentage as additional profit in practical terms this means that the more halliburton spends the richer it gets now we talked to former halliburton employees who worked in iraq they told us the informal company motto was do not worry about price it is cost plus halliburton was supposed to be in iraq to provide support for the troops but the company used one standard for the troops and a completely different standard for its own executives halliburton employees stayed at the fivestar kempinski hotel in kuwait where it costs taxpayers 10 000 per day this is the fivestar kempinski this gorgeous hotel offered maid service complimentary fruit baskets to halliburton employees our troops stayed in tents in the desert at one point a costconscious army official asked halliburton to move its employees into airconditioned tents but they refused to their credit career government auditors identified these overcharges when they examined halliburtons second oil contract they harshly criticized halliburtons performance citing profound systemic problems and exorbitant indirect costs but their recommendations were rejected after reviewing halliburtons first oil contract in iraq auditors recommended that the army not pay 263 million in unreasonable and unsupported charges but the army ignored those auditors and paid halliburton 254 million over 95 percent of the disputed charges and in spite of theauditors findings halliburton was paid nearly 100 million in profits and bonuses for overbilling taxpayers well halliburton symbolizes what went astray in iraq but it is not the only contractor abusing the system parsons received the c6ntract to rebuild health clinics throughout iraq but despite spending 186 million parsons completed just 20 of 142 health clinics they promised to build another firm custer battles received two security contracts a federal jury recently found that the company committed 37 separate acts of fraud these are not isolated instances there are over 70 corruption investigations currently under way in iraq these cases involve allegations of fraud false claims theft bribery and kickbacks some of the worst problems in iraq are almost beyond comprehension the unitedstates management of the development fund for iraq which was the fund that held the proceeds of iraqi oil sales is a classic example of what not to do the coalition provisional authority handed out over 8 8 billion in cash in cash to iraqi ministries and they had no idea what happened to the money 8 billion in cash simply vanished one former unitedstates official who was in iraq at the time frank willis described conditions as the wild west he said the lack of controls effectively created a free fraud zone iraq was awash in brandnew 100 bills with no accountability to prevent corruption all the while the white house looked the other way and congress put its head in the sand under the constitution we are supposed to be a check and balance but we have abdicated this responsibility the republican majority is terrific at applauding the president and they are proving it again today with this dishonest resolution congress isnt doing the serious and important work it must do to protect our troops rebuild iraq look out for american taxpayers congress must be more than a cheerleading section for the white house the fiasco in iraq was a windfall for some halliburton made more than 2 billion in profits last year its total revenue has increased by 66 percent since 2002 another beneficiary was david brooks he is the ceo of a company that makes bulletproof vests in 2001 mr brooks reportedly earned 525 000 in 2004 he earned 70 million last year the unitedstates marines recalled more than 5 000 of the companys armored vests but by that time mr brooks had pocketed 186 million well the american people might think that congress would rise up in the face of such unconscionable profiteering when our troops are willing to sacrifice so much and they do sacrifice so much how can we let others create cynical fortunes off their blood as we debate this resolution 2 500 of our bravest men and women have been killed in iraq over 18 000 have been wounded and the total cost of the iraq war is over 300 billion those of us privileged to serve here have been spared any of the personal consequences of being on the front line but we should not be spared the responsibility of doing our job we owe more to our troops than slapping i support our troops bumper stickers on our cars and extolling their courage instead of wasting time on bipartisan charades we should acknowledge and fix our mistakes so that iraqis can take over and our troops in iraq can come home we owe more than empty promises to american families who are paying for this costly war in iraq they count on us to make sure that their money is spent well and we havent done that an honest unsparing look at the record of the past 3 years tells us a stark truth the white house and congress have failed our troops the taxpayers and the iraqi people they deserve better than a partisan resolution that pats ourselves and the white house on the back it is shameful that we are squandering money on halliburton at the very same time that we dont have enough money to protect our troops it is shameful that congress has abdicated its oversight and legislative responsibilities to rein in the incompetence and corruption that has undermined our efforts in

not realize there was a war in iraq or afghanistan the estimates were made in 2002 and he had not read the paper since so he did not know there were any veterans coming home who had lost their limbs who were grievously injured so they did not revise those things until just yesterday when they realized they are 1 billion short for this year and 2 6 billion short for next year come on do you think

are only asking one thing you made me a promise when i signed up and put my life on the line you promised you would take care of me if i was wounded and you promised you would take care of my family

process where the consequences are reviewed and then a decision is made the problem with the present process is this when the contractor wins the competition the employees do not have a right of appeal if they wish to dispute the finding on the other hand if the employees win the competition the contractor does have the right of appeal we think that this is an unfair and unfortunate policy

in support of house concurrent resolution 354 which expresses congress continued support to require institutions of higher education to provide military recruiters the same access to students as they provide to other employers i am pleased to join with the gentlewoman from virginia in suppoyt of this measure i would also like to recognize the gentleman from california for bringing this n~easure forward today on march 6 2006 just a few days ago the united states supreme court affirmed the statutory provision that requires institutions of higher education to provide access to students at least equal in quality and equal in scope to those that are provided to other employers in order to be eligible for receipt of federal funds the statutory provision commonly referred to as the solomon amendment was first enacted in 1994 and has subsequently been amended over the past several years however the basic underlying premise of the provision is that a college or university that denies military recruiters access equal to other recruiters would lose their federal funds the supreme court found that the solomon amendment does not violate the first amendment and that congress can require law schools to provide equal access to military recruiters without violating the schools freedom of speech or association as schools are free to not accept federal funding we are a nation at war and military recruiters need to be able to recruit individuals from all walks of life from the high school graduate to the person completing their doctorate and all of those in between whether they are undergraduates in liberal arts whether they are law school students or medical professionals completing their residency the military in many ways is just a microcosm of our society as a whole

couple of committees where there is bipartisan spirit at least some of the time and we are able to get a few things done and this is one of them the perkins act aims to prepare youth and adults for the future by building their academic and technical skills in preparation for postsecondary education and or employment the bill we are considering today enhances perkins by ensuring both secondary and postsecondary students participating in the program are acquiring rigorous academic and technical skills and will have the opportunity to transition into further education and or successful employment the perkins act governs widely supported programs of both the secondary and postsecondary level for example nearly all high school students complete at least one vocational education course and approximately 26 percent of students are considered vocational concentrators those students who focus on a single occupational area in my home state of delaware we have five career and technical high schools that enroll a total of 5 500 of the 29 500 total high school students at the postsecondary level the perkins act supports a broad array of options primarily at the community college level including delaware technical community college in the 19992000 school year over 50 percent of all students enrolled at the less than 4year postsecondary level reported that they were majoring in vocational areas todays conference report seeks to build upon reforms made in past reauthorizations and seeks to enhance this popular program to ensure its success in years to come the legislation before us today makes significant reforms to academic achievement and accountability to ensure students have the skills necessary to enter the workforce or continue to an institution of higher learning as i mentioned there are five career and technical high schools in delaware while all these schools met adequately yearly progress under the no child left behind act there is more to be done in academic achievement in these schools and schools across the country today we will improve vocational and technical education by increasing the focus on academics in conjunction with the skill attainment that is incumbent of the program one of the unique attributes of vocational and technical education programs is their ability to show students a path that could end in a certificate credential employment military or postsecondary education the techprep program within the perkins act is intended to focus on a welldefined link between high school and at least 2 years of postsecondary education research has shown however that funds are rarely if ever used to meet this goal rather funds are often used for purposes within the larger vocational and technical education program therefore the conference agreement revises requirements of the program in order to ensure articulation agreements between secondary and postsecondary institutions are in fact being implemented along this same track we include a new requirement for state development of career and technical programs of study for career and technical program areas these sequences of course will incorporate a nonduplicative progression of both secondary and postsecondary elements which will include both academic and vocational and technical content local recipients at both the secondary and postsecondary level would adopt at least one model sequence of courses as developed by the state i believe this will also help drive program improvements by ensuring that states clarify the progression of academic and vocational technical courses needed for the postsecondary education training or employment of a students choice it is clear that we are making some significant and positive changes for the schools and students impacted by this program one of the biggest changes that i think we are making is for congress to finally make the switch from vocational and technical education to career and technical education in my opinion this was an important statement for the congress to make while the president has proposed another avenue for high school reform in the perkins act i believe strongly that the reforms we consider today go a long way in driving program improvement and ultimate success for students across the country the dialogue surrounding high school reform is important and is happening in earnest i trust that the conference agreement will complement these efforts as a result of the changes in the bill i believe it will help states community colleges and other postsecondary education

they have played in promoting and supporting this resolution their chairman ralph mccutchen wanted above all to seea bill that honors and pays tribute to the many sacrifices made by americas seniors including those who have served in the military i certainly appreciate the support demonstrated by this very important organization this resolution recognizes the importance of honoring senior citizens this can be done in countless numbers of ways from simple gestures of kindness towards a stranger to the actions made by this congress that will impact seniors as a whole we are the policymakers we should not make policy that makes it more difficult for seniors to vote we should not have policy that makes it more difficult for seniors to obtain medical care we should not enact policy that makes it more difficult for seniors to obtain prescription drugs or to afford housing this resolution encourages children and students to take time to learn from senior citizens it is

important in this respect and i am going to quote sir oliver lodge never throw away hastily any old faith tradition or convention thly are the result of the experience of many generations so age is important as far as experience and having the life experiences i still remember my father when i used to ask that was a brilliant man dad where did he go to school and he said it was the school of hard knocks so many times it is just life experiences that will instill that wonderful knowledge that is imparted to succeeding generations but age does not constitute and define seniors and i will
