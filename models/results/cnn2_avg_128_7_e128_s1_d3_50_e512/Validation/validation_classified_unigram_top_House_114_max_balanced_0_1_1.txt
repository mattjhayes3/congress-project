{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "anyone who thought the democrats would go away after we were driven to a sitin on the house floor for gun safety legislation learned differently very soon after we got home on wednesday june 29 when events were held all across the country on a national day of action for gun violence prevention we served notice yes there have been moments of outrage and sometimes we have not kept up the battle unceasingly watch us this time i am very pleased that our very effective police chief cathy lanier came with me to a roundtable where we heard not only from her but from residents of the district of columbia who have experienced the incredible heartache and throbbing agony of the loss of a loved one to gun violence this morning unstimulated by me parents organized themselves to come to the capitol at 9 they call themselves d c moms and dads for rational gun safety legislation they are a group of spontaneously formed district of columbia parents who lack voting representation in the congress although they pay the highest taxes per capita of any americans they do not have the final vote on the house floor and they have no senators they wanted to come and show their support for national gun legislation to prevent gun violence in our city and our country they came when the week before i had just fought off three amendments in the house rules committee to undermine d c s gun laws with an attempt to erase some of those laws it is interesting that in the rules committee i was able to keep those republican amendments to take away our gun laws from being made in order i think it is because the rules committee took place only days after orlando and even republicans didnt have the nerve to authorize gun legislation so close to the orlando gun massacre is that what it is going to take or will it take the persistence that you saw when democrats had no alternative but to sit on this hard floor just before recess now the republicans have gotten the permission of the nra to include a gun bill in a pending bill no wonder it makes things worse now you would have to go before a judge before you can get someone off the nofly list instead of depending on the slow administrative process you would go through the much slower judicial process thank you for nothing it certainly wont satisfy us or the american people we who live in your nations capital need national gun legislation to keep guns from flowing in from weak gun jurisdictions and we need congress to leave our gun safety laws alone without fail every single year i have to drive back attempts to overturn our gun laws i just described three that were in the rules committee before we left that i was able to drive back because of orlando yes i am proud that the nations capital has the strongest gun laws in the country as well it might controversial world figures walk our streets and visit our restaurants weak gun laws we do not need in this capital we have effective enforcement we have good relations among chief lanier and her police force and our residents but we are still at the mercy of a congress which will not do its job during our house sitin i left the floor to go to a press conference held by the mayor and the police chief displaying ak47s and other guns illegal in the district of columbia but that you can simply go to a gun show and buy undermining our gun laws our gun problem in cities like ours and many cities and jurisdictions across the country are not local problems they are a national problem that is why you see us demanding universal background checks that is why we are demanding that congress stop censuring the cdc from studying gun laws i thank the moms and dads and kids who marched to the capitol today for overriding their denial of a vote to come here you sent a dual message pass gun safety legislation and give d c the vote"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "as i close let me thank the gentleman for his courtesy mr van hollen is right i have served on the judiciary committee it is there that we deal with the problems particularly on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "earlier today the distinguished gentlewoman from california introduced a privileged resolution not too different from the one my friend and colleague mr thompson brought to the floor just last week that resolution called for the immediate removal of the confederate battle flag from the capitol grounds and my colleagues across the aisle moved quickly to banish that resolution to die in committee earlier today the original home of the confederacy argued but agreed that the confederate flag and the history it represents belong in a museum they decided that the flag should not serve as a bright waving reminder of the discrimination and disparity of treatment for people of color that still lingers in communities across our countryhateful sentiments that resulted in the loss of nine lives at emanuel ame church in charleston they decided that that flag should not hang high above the halls of state government forcing all those who see it to wonder whether the emotions and ideology so closely tied to it are present in the hearts and minds of those who serve in that statehouse they decided that the flag had flown long enough and that taking it down would be one small but critical step in healing the deep divisions present in their state they stood against the symbol of bigotry they stood against years of complacency and they stood for the principles of equality justice and unity for this nation they will take that flag down tomorrow but republican leadership in this body refuses to do that they took the path of cowardice and turned a blind eye to the struggles of generations of americans they used backhanded tactics last night to muddle the language of the interior and environment appropriations bill including language intended to satisfy members who would rather see that flag fly the fallout from that language led to the disappearance of that bill from todays scheduled debate and resulted in the chairman of that subcommittee disowning the final product leader pelosis resolution offered another opportunity for my colleagues across the aisle to stand on the right side of history but they turned that chance down resoundingly lets not mince words while i stand with my brothers and sisters of the south the confederacy itself fell far below even common decency for fellow man violating human rights and taking advantage of every part of the lives of the men and women they enslaved sometimes for profit and sometimes purely for pleasure the confederacy used extreme violence and terrorism to subjugate millions purely on the basis of the color of their skin and started the deadliest war ever to take place on unitedstates soil to defend a disgraceful system that flag is a symbol of the confederacys effort to keep that system intact that is why before the holiday i stood in this very spot on the floor to denounce the hate bigotry malice discrimination and division that the confederate flag stands for but i also reminded my colleagues that a symbol while significant is only a standin for something far stronger a symbol will never have the strength of a bullet fired from the barrel of a policemans gun at an unarmed black man because of ingrained bias a symbol will never have the impact of a prison sentence that permanently prevents a young person from becoming a fullfledged member of society a fate far more likely to befall a person of color a symbol will never eradicate black and latino wealth like the predatory loan structures that put their homes underwater in a recession at rates that dwarfed their white peers but if we are not even willing to get rid of a symbol as this body has so clearly expressed its disinterest in doing how can we possibly move on to the real underlying problems issues like education for young people affordable housing and access and training for jobs removing a symbol is an easy thing to do an easy thing that would have signaled one country indivisible with liberty and justice for all today republican members across the aisle did more than just stand up for that symbol of hate and that symbol of degradation these members treated me and those issues that are vitally important and extremely sensitive to me in a manner that was both disrespectful insensitive and very hurtful nonetheless this will not go away we will continue to raise this issue every day that it is needed every week that it is needed every month that it is needed until my colleagues can recognize that a simple act of decency the removal of this symbol of hate and disrespect and slavery a mark on our history that needs to be removed once we do that once we do that simple little thing and that is to stand together in taking down that ugly symbol that that flag represents then we will be able to get on with the serious and important work that needs to be done to lift up this economy on behalf of all people that will be education for all people and higher education that is affordable for all people it will be affordable housing it will be jobs and job training it will be adequate preschool programs and afterschool programs it will be recreation programs and characterbuilding programs it will be safe communities it will be equal opportunity for all because that is the country that we live in and that is the reason that we have this congress and that is the reason that i am here i for one will not be silent on this issue until we see this change that the 21st century demands i yield to the gentleman from california"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "first let me thank the gentleman from new york for those very kind remarks but also i want to thank you and congresswoman beatty for organizing this very important special order and for your tremendous leadership congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty on ensuring public safety your leadership both congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries has been bold it has been visionary not just as the result of the very recent tragedies but for many many years even before both of you came to congress so it is an honor serving with both of you in this body thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening also i want to just thank congresswoman robin kelly who is the vice chair on the gun violence task force she also chairs the cbcs health braintrust i thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is treated as a public health problem which it is i rise this evening with my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to call on congress to do somethingto do somethingabout the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our communities since the start of the yearjust 11 days agonine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides my thoughts are with the victims family at this very terribly difficult time we have to do something enough is enough congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence whether it is charleston oak creek sandy hook the streets of oakland or wherever too many people have already lost their lives too many families have buried loved ones and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence now is the time for action our constituents are demanding action the country is demanding action i have received hundreds of calls and emails from my constituents and i know other members are also hearing from their constituents they are calling for action as well earlier today in my own district oakland city council president lynette gibson mcelehany buried her grandson 17yearold torian hughes who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before christmas this has been a very difficult period for council member mcelehany and her family so in addition to our prayers not only for my council members family but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence we must do something we must do something in all of their memory let me be clear congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents their families and communities last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of americans in applauding president obamas actions to reduce gun violence in our nation thanks to the presidents leadership there will be more background checks better enforcement of existing gun laws improved mental health services and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence but more action is needed to stop the more than 30 000 gun deaths that occur in our nation each and every year congress must pass commonsense gun reform like closing the gun show loophole bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of americans and gun owners congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services but this should not be an excuse of course to do nothing on gun safety we have got to provide the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the resources it needs to enforce our nations gun laws as a member of the appropriations committee i have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe we must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcements ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue that is why i introduced last year h r 1449 the tiahrt restrictions repeal act which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks these data restrictions are commonly called the tiahrt restrictions they prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public these provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the national criminal background check system records to be destroyedmind you destroyedwithin 24 hours prohibiting the atf from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and state law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers this is outrageous we have got to restrict and repeal these tiahrt amendments right away it will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals it is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes the tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers law enforcement and federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community of course many of us are proud to support congresswoman kellys bill which would allow the surgeon general to study gun violence as a public health issue and the consumer product safety commission to regulate firearms the time for action is now lets start listening to the american people and insist that congress do something it is really disingenuous to criticize the president for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this bodyfor yearsto get these sensible bills passed the speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that congress can act no more excuses we should support congressman thompsons proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence the speaker should do this now so we cant continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about congress we need to do our job we have been trying many of us the congressional black caucus and others especially democrats for many years to try to get the speaker to bring these bills to the floor so what did the president do he had to do something but no more excuses congress needs to act so i thank congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries for this very important special order hour and for your tremendous leadership"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "fornia we are on a dangerous path first my republican colleagues pulled two critical appropriation bills from the floor simply because their party cannot come to an agreement on a flag that represents a very dark time in our nations history second my colleagues across the aisle rather than focusing their energy on passing comprehensive immigration reform passed a poisonous antiimmigrant bill in response to an isolated incident in the city of san francisco pulling money away from our law enforcement funding for public safety then they refuse to reauthorize the exportimport bank which helps ensure that americans businesses can compete with their global competitors and now the house republicans refuse to come to the table yet again to provide a robust longterm funding bill for our decaying infrastructure system in america why do we continue to refuse and cut services that our communities need the american people need goodpaying jobs safe and modern infrastructure and efficient transportation in order to provide a better life for themselves and for their families we need to end these stopgap extensions how do we fix a broken bridge or a broken highway two months of highway funding will not do that in my home state of california 60 percent of our roads are in poor or mediocre condition and moreover almost 30 percent of californias bridges have been recognized by the department of transportation as structurally deficient just a little bit over a week ago california residents experienced the reallife consequences of this statistic when the interstate 10 which connects california and arizona collapsed injuring a resident and shutting down the highway for several days this highway is critical to our southwest economy which is already suffering from deficiencies because of our water infrastructure and the drought that we have going on with more than 60 000 bridges throughout the united states in need of drastic repairs failing to provide americans with a longterm highway bill we are putting jobs at risk and we are putting our lives at risk which is why my fellow house democrats have come together to provide a 6year funding bill known as the grow america act the bill will provide for 178 billion over 6 years so that states and local municipalities can address critical infrastructure needs this commonsense legislation would help pay for the investments by ending an unfair tax loophole and limiting corporate inversions meaning that big corporations when they are renouncing their united states citizenship they do that in order to avoid paying taxes lets use that money for transportation investments here in america investing in local public transportation projects not only helps to improve our traffic flow but it also helps create good jobs as we look for ways to put our economy back on track we must be mindful of the services that we provide to the american people we need to stop slashing and we need to start providing we need to get away from sequestration and patchwork funding mentality to actually fulfill our duty as public servants to the american people our families our roads and our economy deserve a highway funding bill that will invest in americas future invest in better infrastructure and invest in bigger

would not be deported i would argue to my friends that whatever the vote is today it is not the sense of the house it is a divided house and we are not supporting an amicus to turn back the presidents constitutional authority with that i ask my colleagues to vote no on the underlying resolution i rise in strong opposition to both the rule governing debate of h res 639 and the underlying resolution which authorizes the speaker to appear as amicus curiae on behalf of the house of representatives in the matter of united states et al v texas et al no 15674 i oppose the resolution because it is nothing more than the republican majoritys latest partisan attack on the president and another diversionary tactic to avoid addressing the challenge posed by the nations broken immigration system h res 639 if adopted would vest in the speaker alone the power to file on behalf of the full house an amicus brief with the supreme court supporting the constitutionally untenable position of 26 republicancontrolled states in the matter of united states et al v texas et al no 15674 lying at the heart of the plaintiffs misguided and wholly partisan complaint is the specious claim that president obama lacked the constitutional and statutory authority to take executive actions to implement administration policy with regard to deferred action for childhood arrivals daca and deferred action for parents of american citizens and lawful permanent residents the creation of dapa this frivolous and partisan lawsuit seeks to have daca and dapa declared invalid and to permanently enjoin the obama administration from implementing these salutary policies both of which are intended to keep lawabiding and peace loving immigrant families together the purely partisan nature of the resolution before us is revealed by its text which authorizes the speaker to waste precious taxpayer funds and file on behalf of every member of the house an amicus brief that no member has seen in support of a position opposed by virtually every member of the democratic caucus let me briefly discuss why the executive actions taken by president obama are reasonable responsible and within his constitutional authority pursuant to article ii section 3 of the constitution the president the nations chief executive shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed in addition to establishing the presidents obligation to execute the law the supreme court has consistently interpreted the take care clause as ensuring presidential control over those who execute and enforce the law and the authority to decide how best to enforce the laws see e g arizona v united states bowsher v synar buckley v valeo printz v united states free enterprise fund v pcaob every law enforcement agency including the agencies that enforce immigration laws has prosecutorial discretion the inherent power to decide whom to investigate arrest detain charge and prosecute thus enforcement agencies including the unitedstates department of homeland security dhs properly may exercise their discretion to devise and implement policies specific to the laws they are charged with enforcing the population they serve and the problems they face so that they can prioritize our nations resources to meet mission critical enforcement goals to see the utter lack of merit in the legal position to be supported by the amicus brief permitted by h res 639 one need take note of the fact that deferred action has been utilized in our nation for decades by administrations headed by presidents of both parties without controversy or challenge in fact as far back as 1976 ins and dhs leaders have issued at least 11 different memoranda providing guidance on the use of similar forms of prosecutorial discretion executive authority to take action is thus fairly wide and the federal governments discretion is extremely broad as the supreme court held in the recent case of arizona v united states 132 s ct 2492 2499 2012 an opinion written by justice kennedy and joined by chief justice roberts congress has specified which aliens may be removed from the united states and the procedures for doing so aliens may be removed if they were inadmissible at the time of entry have been convicted of certain crimes or meet other criteria set by federal law removal is a civil not criminal matter a rincipal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials federal officials as an initial matter must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all if removal proceedings commence aliens may seek asylum and other discretionary relief allowing them to remain in the country or at least to leave without formal removal emphasis added citations omitted the courts decision in arizona v united states also strongly suggests that the executive branchs discretion in matters of deportation may be exercised on an individual basis or it may be used to protect entire classes of individuals such as nauthorized workers trying to support their families or immigrants who originate from countries torn apart by internal conflicts discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate human concerns unauthorized workers trying to support their families for example likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime the equities of an individual case may turn on many factors including whether the alien has children born in the united states long ties to the community or a record of distinguished military service some discretionary decisions involve policy choices that bear on this nations international relations returning an alien to his own country may be deemed inappropriate even where he has committed a removable offense or fails to meet the criteria for admission the foreign state may be mired in civil war complicit in political persecution or enduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien or his family will be harmed upon return the dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the executive branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent with this nations foreign policy with respect to these and other realities exercising thoughtful discretion in the enforcement of the nations immigration law saves scarce taxpayer funds optimizes limited resources and produces results that are more humane and consistent with americas reputation as the most compassionate nation on earth a dreamer an undocumented student seeking to earn her college degree and aspiring to attend medical school to better herself and her new community is not a threat to the nations security law abiding but unauthorized immigrants doing honest work to support their families pose far less danger to society than human traffickers drug smugglers or those who have committed a serious crime the president was correct in concluding that exercising his discretion regarding the implementation of daca and dapa policies enhances the safety of all members of the public serves national security interests and furthers the public interest in keeping families together according to numerous studies conducted by the congressional budget office social security administration and council of economic advisors the presidents daca and dapa directives generate substantial economic benefits to our nation for example unfreezing dapa and expanded daca is estimated to increase gdp by 230 billion and create an average of 28 814 jobs per year over the next 10 years that is a lot of jobs in exercising his broad discretion in the area of removal proceedings president obama has acted responsibly and reasonably in determining the circumstances in which it makes sense to pursue removal and when it does not in exercising this broad discretion president obama not done anything that is novel or unprecedented let me cite a just a few examples of executive action taken by american presidents both republican and democratic on issues affecting immigrants over the past 35 years 1 in 1987 president ronald reagan used executive action in 1987 to allow 200 000 nicaraguans facing deportation to apply for relief from expulsion and work authorization 2 in 1980 president jimmy carter exercised parole authority to allow cubans to enter the unitedstates and about 123 000 mariel cubans were paroled into the unitedstates by 1981 3 in 1990 president george h w bush issued an executive order that granted deferred enforced departure ded to certain nationals of the peoples republic of china who were in the united states 4 in 1992 the bush administration granted ded to certain nationals of el salvador 5 in 1997 president bill clinton issued an executive order granting ded to certain haitians who had arrived in the united states before dec 31 1995 6 in 2010 the obama administration began a policy of granting parole to the spouses parents and children of military members because of the presidents leadership and visionary executive action 594 000 undocumented immigrants in my home state of texas are eligible for deferred action if these immigrants are able to remain united with their families and receive a temporary work permit it would lead to a 338 million increase in tax revenues over five years finally let me note that the presidents laudable executive actions are a welcome development but not a substitute for undertaking the comprehensive reform and modernization of the nations immigration laws supported by the american people only congress can do that americas borders are dynamic with constantly evolving security challenges border security must be undertaken in a manner that allows actors to use pragmatism and common sense comprehensive immigration reform is desperately needed to ensure that lady libertys lamp remains the symbol of a land that welcomes immigrants to a community of immigrants and does so in a manner that secures our borders and protects our homeland instead of wasting time debating divisive and mean spirited measures like h res 639 we should instead seize the opportunity to pass legislation that secures our borders preserves americas character as the most open and welcoming country in the history of the world and will yield hundreds of billions of dollars in economic growth i urge all members to join me

make no mistake the issues rocking many communities are not a new phenomenon these tragedies yes are a part of a dark legacy of injustice born in the sufferings of the middle passage nurtured through slavery and codified in jim crow on april 14 1967 at stanford university dr king described these issues in his two americas speech he said there are literally two americas one america is overflowing with the milk of prosperity and honey of opportunity tragically and unfortunately there is another america this other america has a daily ugliness about it that constantly transforms the ebulliency of hope into the fatigue of despair the ugly fact is that two americas still exist nearly five decades later an african american male is killed by a security officer police officer or a selfproclaimed vigilante every 28 hours in the united states one in three black men will be arrested in their lifetime a reason why men from communities of color unfortunately make up more than 70 percent of the

all federal agencies we can lift 22 million americans out of poverty and into the middle class but that is only one step we must bring serious structural reforms to our broken criminal justice system

americans we need to pass the end racial profiling act h r 1933 because racial profiling has no place in a 21st century police force it is also time to pass ban the box for federal contractors and

of 186 members of congress and it would simply require every firearm sale to conduct a background check it is a commonsense bill that 90 percent of americans support and that would save lives right now anyone can buy a gun online or at a gun show without a background check i ask you how does that make sense by not requiring background checks for gun shows or online purchases we are inviting bad guys to access guns we have a gaping hole in our system that must be closed it is time for the house to take action on gun violence this week we finally have a gun bill on the floor except that it isnt a gun violence prevention bill it is a bill written by the big gun lobby that would give the attorney general just 72 hours to determine if someone on the nofly list should be able to purchase a gun to call this a gun violence protection bill is disrespectful and dishonors the millions of victims of gun violence what will it take for this house to take action on a real gun violence bill when

take place how is it you can get every group in the democratic party to basically join in an action that had never taken place before what am i talking about i am talking about the womens caucus the black caucus the progressive caucus i am talking about new democrats i am talking about all of those in our democratic party who do not always agree with each other we work at it but we have serious and credible disagreements however you did not hear any denouncement from any of our democrats about what we were doing why did we do this and why did we have basically so much support for what we did when i say support i am not simply talking about democrats i am talking about people who left their homes their businesses and their workplaces and joined us outside they even stayed for hours in the rain to say to us thank you for finally giving voice to this problem that we have in this country on gun violence the members of the democratic party and those people who were outside basically said we are sick and tired of the influence that is exerted by the gun lobby you have the nra that owns too many members of congress and who can tell them what to do there are members who are intimidated by the gun lobby and the nra so what they do is they hide behind the constitution and they will tell you that they are defending their constitutional rights none of us in what we sat in about talked about taking away anybodys guns what we said was we have got to make sure that guns are not in the hands of people who should not have them people who have committed crimes people who have committed murder people who have shown that perhaps something is wrong with them psychologically or emotionally we should not make it easy for these people to have guns what should we do about it we have two very simple bills and we begged the speaker of this house to allow us to take up those bills to debate those bills to have them voted up or down well the speaker wont do it the speaker wont do it because as it has been described he too is a handmaiden of the gun lobby along with all of the other members afraid to come and represent and to deal with the tough issues that confront us what were those bills all about one is very easy to explain no fly no buy what does that mean it simply means that if you are on a list that says you cant get on an airplane because you are dangerous we know something about you that will not allow us to allow you to get on an airplane where you may commit an action that could endanger the lives of everybody on that plane and others even on the ground no fly no buy why should we sell guns to somebody who we have said are too dangerous to fly on the airplane that is all we wanted on that bill was a vote to say yeah that makes good sense if you cannot fly you should not be able to buy what is wrong with that that is very simple why cant they take up that bill arent they concerned about who gets on the airplane yes but if you are concerned about who gets on the airplane you should be concerned about who is able to buy a gun the other bill is just as clear just as simple universal background checks we need to know who is buying these guns somebody will say dont we have something about background checks in the law ladies and gentlemen we are not covering what is on the internet we are not covering the fact that these gun shows are selling guns

shootings were absolutely horrific and unthinkable under any definition they are just unthinkable my prayers go out to the families in orlando for their pain and for all that they are having to endure because of these mass shootings as someone said a few moments ago a moment of silence is not enough it is time for this congress to act it is time for this body to have a serious debate about gun violence and to pass legislation that will deprive people the right to own a highcapacity assault weapon and highcaliber bullets and use them to kill innocent people now is the time 136 mass shootings have taken place during the first 164 days of this year it is a sad statistic that we must address the united states is 5 percent of the worlds population yet we are 31 percent of the mass shootings in the world it is time to act let me talk about the topic tonight very briefly the congressional black caucus has been committed to advancing access to affordable health care for all americans so that we can eliminate racially based health disparities that has been our mission for many years eliminating health disparities means addressing inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in all of our communities by all measurable statistics from health outcomes to participation in health professions african americans lag so far behind for example more than 40 percent of african americans have high blood pressurea rate that is one of the highest in the world african americans are more likely to develop hypertension at a younger age and are at higher risk of stroke heart failure endstage renal disease and death from heart disease stroke is the third leading cause of death in the united states african americans are 50 percent more likely to experience a stroke than white americans that is a fact according to the federal centers for disease control and prevention african american children are twice as likely to have asthma as white children and black children are 10 times more likely than white children to die of complications from asthma african americans were on average 6 years younger than whites when they suffered sudden cardiac arrest cardiac arrest incidence among african american men was 175 per 100 000 whereas the incidence for white males was just 84 per 100 000 cardiac arrest in african american women was 90 per 100 000 as opposed to 40 per 100 000 for caucasian women another illness which disparately impacts the african american community is that of prostate cancer in june of last year i introduced the national prostate cancer plan act a bipartisan bill which seeks to establish the national prostate cancer council on screening early detection and assessment and monitoring of prostate cancer prostate cancer impacts one in seven american men and is the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths among men in the unitedstates with nearly 30 000 deaths anticipated just this year african american men are particularly vulnerable as they are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2 5 times more likely to die from the disease than their white counterparts just last week house republicans released their a better way agenda to address poverty but that proposal like others they have released will not lift americans out of poverty in some cases these types of proposals can actually push lowincome americans even deeper into poverty further limiting their access to health care and exacerbating health disparities so it is time for us to continue our efforts to address the health disparities and

efficiency standards restrict consumer choice but if you have shopped for light bulbs lately you know that simply isnt true modern incandescent bulbs compact fluorescent light bulbs and leds of every

standards claimed that they would cost consumers money in fact the opposite is true when the standards are in full effect the average american family will save about 100 every year that comes to 13 billion in savings nationwide every year but this rider threatens those savings and that is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider here is the reality the 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for light bulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to receive overwhelming industry support unitedstates manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards the effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old inefficient light bulbs in the united states that violate the efficiency standards that is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in the united states in those plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers who are following our laws but it even gets worse the rider now poses an additional threat to unitedstates manufacturing the bipartisan 2007 energy bill requires the department of energy to establish updated light bulb efficiency standards by january 1 of next year it also provided that if final updated standards are not issued by then a more stringent standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect incandescent light bulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard this rider blocks doe from issuing the required efficiency standards and ensures that the backstop will kick in ironically it is this rider that could effectively ban the incandescent light bulb the burgess rider directly threatens existing light bulb manufacturing jobs in pennsylvania ohio illinois across our region it would stifle innovation and punish companies that have invested in domestic manufacturing this rider aims to reverse years of technological progress only to kill jobs increase electricity bills for our constituents and worsen pollution it is time to choose common sense over rigid ideology and it is time to listen to the

appreciate that mr takano does believe that we need to provide real accountability at the department of veterans affairs but as i said at our committee markup when he offered an almost identical amendment this substitute fails to achieve true accountability i am supportive of section 3 of his amendment which would limit administrative leave for all employees to 14 days and i agree with this commonsense policy but i would note that this limitation language is already included in my bill h r 1994 my main concern with the substitute lies within section 2 which would dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my bill of removing va employees the substitute would only give the secretary the authority to remove an employee if they represent a clear and direct threat to public health or safety which is almost an unobtainable if not immeasurable bar to reach this undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the secretary to remove any employee under this new authority thereby ensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service rules would continue unfortunately as i said moments ago maintaining the status quo is not acceptable i would submit that the standard of a clear and direct threat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees involved with many of todays ongoing scandals at the va including the cost overruns of the denver hospital the budget shortfall that we are going to vote to fix later today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the whistle not only does this not provide any protections on the front end but it would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections i have included in section 4 of my bill we all know that the secretary has a tall task to restore trust and to rebuild the va we have to give him every tool possible to complete that mission this amendment does not come close to giving him the tool that he needs today so once again i urge members to support change and stand with veterans not the bureaucrats and the special interest groups and the status quo i urge members to oppose the takano substitute i reserve the balance of my

the last day we vote during the week we are allowed to have unlimited 1minute speeches and fori dont know2 or 3 hours my friends across the aisle have been doing 1minute speeches and i am so pleased that they are doing that i think that is terrific that is so much better than taking away the civil rights of people who have the right to assemble on the floor to have sessions to vote on bills to debate bills because the previous violations of the rules by my friends across the aisle were just unprecedented i would like to commend our speaker for this aspect comparing what he did and did not do today compared to what speaker pelosi did the last day of our session in july of 2008 because today i know leadership and staff saw the massive number of democrats assembled to give speeches here and the rule allows for that there was no effort to shut down debate gavel us out early but that is exactly what speaker nancy pelosi did in july of 2008 we had assembled a group it may not have been quite as big as the democrats had today but we had a group over here and under the rules at that time they were 5minute speeches which could still be done but they chose 1minutes we signed up for 5minute speeches when the speaker nancy pelosi saw a number of republicans appropriately under the rule here in order signed up we werent just sitting there we had signed up and were sitting in order as we are supposed to she immediately gaveled down the proceeding early violated the rule that allowed us to speak in the order just as the democrats did today and this is the way it is supposed to be yet earlier this month we had our friends across the aisleand i havent seen this written up much but they took positions at their microphones and at the republican microphones we tried to go into session and we even had democrats not only sitting where republicans were supposed to be seated on the republican side we had them grasp microphones to prevent republicans from being able to be recognized finally in the wee hours we had the speaker recognize a republican chairman he couldnt get a microphone he is standing over here why because of the violation of the rules as the democrats triednot just tried they were preventing republicans from exercising their civil rights under jeffersons rules of the house under congressional rules and our constituents had a right to be heard just as our friends across the aisle had a right to be heard today now in those 1minute speeches the massive array we heard this afternoon there were a few common themes and i think that is wonderful football is my favorite sport i enjoyed it in junior high 6 7 8 9 10 11 12th grade enjoyed every year of it it is such a team sport we saw a team acting in concert working together they all had their talking points they all hit them and hit them hard some were very unfair but they from their standpoint were acting as a team but for one thing they kept using the term vacation that the house is going on vacation one said a month vacation i think but i know i heard one say 7week vacation another one said 8week vacation they werent all together on how long they were attributing to be vacation i have told some of my friends at fox news and different news commentators that when you criticize the month of august that is traditionally as i understand itgoing back to the early days of congress that has been a month when traditionally congress has not been in session that is why i love september in july i remember the disastrous bill when john boehner was speaker had the supercommittee the sequesters that were going to gut our military i will never forget it after i was rather upset that that bill was going to gut our military our speaker said listen to me listen to me those sequesters will never happen well i knew they would i said they would but we passed some bad stuff in july in prior years i think we have done much better this year as far as this vacation i am intrigued to know that that is what the democrats are going to do with the time we are not in session one 8week vacation as one of my colleagues across the aisle said eightweek vacation that is what they think it is when we are not in session but from my standpointand i am looking at my friend doug lamalfa over here i know from his impression and other people that i work with on this side of the aisle every day that we dont consider not being in session a vacation august man that is a great opportunity to hear from your constituents i know we have at least one field hearing i was requested to come meet again with some of the egyptian leadership and i have been urged to go visit with some of our friends in israel again i dont know if i will make that this is a terrific time to get away from the insidethebeltway thinking it is only when you get away from the insidethebeltway thinking that so many congresses have gotten addicted to that you hear from real common sense back home it is common sense inside the beltway it is sense because it is certainly not common it is a great time when we are in recess to reassess in the recess and september ends up being a good month we dont normally pass terrible bills in september it has happened but normally when people come back after having to visitbecause we are not in session people know we are not in session when they hear from constituents during the month of august they are much more ready in september to do what we should have been doing so i know my friends across the aisle they have their talking points going on this big vacation they consider it a vacation we consider it an incredible opportunity to clear our heads to get this insidethebeltway thinking out of our heads hear from our constituents have some field hearings in different places in the country i find it helpful last year the last week of august i was invited to meet with president sisi in egypt and the coptic christian pope meet with him again i was told at the time that i was the only member of congressi dont know if it is still truewho had been allowed to meet with the director of egyptian intelligence anyway i dont know if i will be able to get back there or not during this recess but it was incredibly invaluable i came away from that meeting in egypt determined to do anything i could to stop the iranian treaty that was not only going to devastate the middle east that was already starting to spark nuclear proliferation because all of our former allies before this president got ahold of them they were saying wow we cant count on the united states anymore irans going to have nuclear weapons that is what this has made sure so we have to start figuring out what we are going to do to get nuclear weapons for ourselves the worst possible result the iran treaty is a treaty it was a treaty it is a treaty and that has become even more clear as iran has violated so many aspects of the iranian treaty unfortunately the senate refused to recognize that it was a treaty they considered the fine senator corkers bill that actually turned the constitution upside down and allowed a treaty to proceed as if it were effective and had been ratified with only a third of the senate voting to ratify it instead of the twothirds that the constitution requires it was that visit in egypt with their top officials that just clarified in my head that we have to stop the iranian treaty for the good of the united states for the good of the middle east for the good of our allies our muslim allies in north africa and the middle east and for our dear friends in israel but so far it hasnt happened and western civilization and the advances we know are more threatened than previously the second talking point that we heard repeatedly from our friends across the aisle during so many of the 1minute speeches was the talk about we are leaving here without doing a thing about the zika virus i dont fault anybody who has been standing up here and repeating the talking point that we havent done anything about the zika virus we havent done anything about the zika virus because there are so many bills that get brought to the floor there are so many amendments so many things it is just virtually impossible to get through them all i read as many as i can some people have told me i am probably reading more bills than most people but you just cant get through them all there is this mentality that if we are in session we have to be passing bills any day we are in session we have to be passing the bills talking to people who were here before they said it wasnt always like that that you could have hearings you could have investigations you could have a lot of meaningful things going on without people being forced to come over here and vote but that is the mentality now whether it is democrats in the majority republicans in the majority gee if we are in session we have to vote on stuff so with that understanding its easy to understand how so many democrats had missed and didnt realize that actually we did vote not only did we vote to address the zika virus we voted to appropriate 1 1 billion toward dealing with a potential zika virus pandemic so for research for vaccine for all of these things so i dont fault anybody i know nobody would have come down here and said we didnt do anything about the zika virus intending to mislead they just didnt remember that we did vote to spend 1 1 billion dealing with that issue also probably the most frequently mentioned thing during the last 2 or 3 hours of speeches by my friends across the aisle was regarding guns and gun violence one of the nicest guys in congress even used a quote from somebody else in saying that republicans are frozen in their own indifference now that is deeply troubling i dont know a single republican who is indifferent to gun violence it is just that we look at chicago we look at washington d c we look at where the most murders are occurring in the country where more black lives that matter are taken and we look at those places and we see whatever they are doing about gun violence it is the wrong thing because they have an epidemic of gun violence what are they doing oh wow they are the most restrictive cities regarding gun violence in the country now in my home state dear dallas is still mourning the loss of five precious lives of law enforcement officers needlessly senselessly taken by an evil that was encouraged by chants and songs repeated over and over and over talking about police as pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon encouraging the devastation and murder of police officers well in texas that is a capital murder and we do use capital punishment so it is not that republicans are frozen in our indifference it is just that we look at the kind of gun laws that have been posed and pushed by our friends across the aisle and we see that the places that their laws have been enacted by democratic leadership in those cities with massive deaths especially of the precious black lives that matter but they dont want to talk about those you dont have to look too far to see what has been going on it is offensive to those of us who are not frozen in our indifference on gun violence we want it stopped when you get beyond the pejoratives that are being muttered on this floor against republicans and you start looking at what the actual news is so you can learn what would be the best way to deal with gun violence you see this article today from national review federal agencies cant keep track of their own guns the article says the federal government needs to crack down on guns its own stockpile anyway the washington examiner reports the federal government has spent 1 5 million on guns and ammo since 2006 and lost nearly 1 000 weapons along the way including uzis assault rifles and grenade launchers according to the house oversight committee chairman in a hearing to urge tightened control of weapons representative jason chaffetz chair of the house oversight and government reform committee said the loss of a single firearm is cause for concernthe loss of what amounts to roughly five a month is unacceptable these guns were acquired by the department of homeland security the bureau of land management and the federal bureau of prisons for use by their agents inventory is managed by the general services administration the agency tasked with managing the affairs of other federal agencies its important for certain federal agents to be armed if their job requires it but its also important for the federal government to keep track of its expensive supplies especially when those supplies have destructive potential and these arent your runofthemill weapons uzis grenade launchers the evernebulous assault rifles plenty of firepower for agents who have dangerous jobs they simply vanished at an alarming clip 1 000 guns lost over the last 10 years come out to just under two per week so sure maybe it is easier to get a glock than a book although that is simply not true but only if youre neighbors with the local branch of the department of homeland security this articleand it is not even a recent articlein the washington examiner by paul bedard says gun prosecutions under obama down more than 45 percent i havent been able to find anything that indicates differently that they have stepped up prosecution my understanding is they continue to decline but they are at least much lower than they were under president bush this article says despite his calls for greater gun control including a new assault weapons ban that extends to handguns president obamas administration has turned away from enforcing gun laws cutting weapons prosecutions some 40 percent since a high of about 11 000 under former president bush if you are not going to enforce the laws on the books then dont start talking about a whole new wave of new laws said a gun rights advocate in the wake of the horrific mass killing at sandy hook elementary school in newtown connecticut democratic lawmakers have begun preparing a new collection of antigun laws including renewing the assault weapons ban banning the purchase of highcapacity clips that spring bullets into guns and tightening rules on who can buy weapons the thing is this administration was given a heads up twice over the older tsarnaev he has been radicalized but because of the purge of the training material that the fbi has experiencedmichele bachmann and i and lynn westmorelandand trent was there for a whilewe were going through the materials that had been purged it was ridiculous what they classified them so we couldnt tell you exactly the things some were silly cartoons and things but speaking hypothetically you had verses from the koran actually there were verses from the koran that were eliminated they were found to be troubling to the people that were purging the materials and who does this administration look to they look to cair the council on american islamic relations they look to imam majid former head of the islamic society of north america they look at a number of groups and individuals who were listed as coconspirators in the largest prosecution of support for terrorism in the united states history the prosecution got guilty verdicts in i believe november 2008 and we changed presidents and eric holder came in as the new attorney general and instead of going after those listed coconspirators that both the fifth circuit court of appeals and the district court had said there is plenty of evidence to support their being named as coconspirators they didnt go after them they dropped it they let it go those are the people that are advising this administration about what to purge out of the training materials for the cia the intelligence the state department homeland security the justice department our folks dont know what they are looking for when they are told to go find out if somebody has been radicalized twice at least the orlando shooter was brought to the attention of the fbi these are caring wellinformed law officers except when it comes to radical islam because you have cair and others making sure they dont know what to look for when they are looking for radicalized islamic terrorists if materials werent purged if people who had dedicated their lives to studying radical islam who are not actually muslims themselves if they were allowed to train as they once were and educate and help our officers of the federal government know what to look for to find a radicalized islamic terrorist then the boston bombing would not have happened the orlando shooting would not have happened the san bernardino killings would have not happened this administration has done grave danger grave harm to this country yet it is like the wizard of oz dont look at what is going on behind the curtain look at this shiny object the gun oh they used a pressure cooker well never mind still lets talk about the gun well if we are going to be honest and you feel like whatever a radical islamist used to kill people that is what we are going to talk about we are not going to talk about radical islam by the way for my democratic friends who called me a racist because i said the orlando shooter was a radical islamist that he had pledged allegiance to the islamic state we learn when people point out mistakes we have made but islam is not a race so it makes no sense to call me a racist as my friends across the aisle did when i pointed out that the orlando shooter pledged allegiance to the islamic state they were thinking that that meant a race and it is not a race it is a religion for a radical islamist it is really the makings of a theocracy then this article from today by neil munro out of breitbart says obamas flack claims credit for dallas policing as murders spike 40 percent i have been so impressed with the dallas police chief the things he said the way he has comported is exactly the way i would hope a police chief under such a terrible situation would comport himself but this is a real story because he has been utilizing president obamas practices for policing as this article points out president barack obamas preferred policing practices deserve the credit for changing the crime rate in dallas his spokesman says but spokesman josh earnest does not seem to be aware the citys dallas murder rate has climbed 40 percent this year as obamas preferred policing practices were implemented some of the 2016 dead in dallas had their pictures in this article the article goes on and says the spokesmans july 13 statement came in response to a reporter asking a question about the value of the policing changes that obama is pressuring state and local police forces to adopt this latest tragedy the murder of the five cops took place in a community dallas that the white house actually touted for having done a good job implementing new policing rules i mean doesnt that suggest that theyre either ineffective or insufficient to prevent these kinds of things from happening asked the reporter the police reforms that have been put in place in dallas have made a difference the reforms that have been put in place in dallas that have made a difference is a quote from josh earnest the spokesman for the president he goes on and says that is a reflection of why its important for other communities to make this issue a priority in the same way that dallas has its making a difference in the lives and the people in dallas because its not just those incidents of concern about police conduct that have declined the violent crime rates declined too that is from josh earnest the story goes on now that we have finished josh earnests ignorance of what really happened in texas in dallas the article says actually violent crime is up across the board in obamas model city of dallas according to the dallas morning news 67 people were murdered in the first five months of 2016 compared to 48 in the first five months of 2015 also robbery is up from 1 576 to 1 805 and aggravated assault is up from 1 501 incidents to 1 747 incidents the relatively good news is that sexual assault nudged down from 336 incidents in 2015 to 312 incidents in 2016 the 2016 spike comes after the murder rate jumped almost 17 percent in 2015 bringing the citys death toll up to 136 dead for 2015 the 2016 crime spike is so large that the citys now famous police chief david brown has faced pressure to resign chief browns career has lived by crime stats and it will die by crime stats said a march headline in the dallas observer according to a march 28 report in the dallas morning news dallas police chief david browns plan to fight a drastic rise in violent crimeincluding a nearly 75 percent jump in murdersby moving hundreds of officers to different shifts and on to task forces is creating an uproar within his department the black police association has historically been supportive of brown but called for his resignation monday hours before the group met with the three other police associations council member philip kingston expressed concern monday about browns plans none of what youve presented here today is sustainable kingston said anyway it goes on to discuss this but i am very impressed with the dallas police chief i think he has comported himself admirably under such horrendous circumstances and while going through such grief losing five of his firstresponding law officers but people need to know that the kind of things that were being urged by my friends across the aisle that obama believes are going to make a big difference well they made a difference murders are up 40 percent now in dallas since they followed the obama rules for policing very very tragic i appreciated dallas police chief david browns statement when he challenged black lives matter during a press conference monday brown issued a challenge to black lives matter protesters demanding change around policing in their communities were hiring get off that protest line and put an application in well put you in your neighborhood and well help you resolve some of the problems youre protesting about apparently according to this article by katie pavlich brown grew up in the inner city and decided to become a police officer during the national crack cocaine epidemic he saw a problem in his community and he wanted to fix it decades later he is in charge of one the most successful police departments in the countrythat is of course before he started following the obama administrations suggestions for effective policing in america another problem that is rather dramaticwe feel it in texas but we are not alone it is a problem across the country illustrated in this article by bob price from july 5 200 000 criminal aliens booked into texas jails over past 5 years says department of public safety nearly 200 000 criminal aliens have been booked into local texas jails over the past 5 years those numbers included more than 155 000 criminal illegal aliens just shocking so this administration has lostwell i guess it goes back to 2006 so most of the 1 000 weapons were lost during this administrations term some of them on bushs watch but the 2 000 or so weaponsthat we know have already killed at least one federal agentthat were forced by this administrationand someday it is all going to come out fast and furious is all going to be exposed at some point and this administration is going to fall further in the estimation of its effectiveness we are already seeing things like oh here are our policing rules they follow them murder rates go up violent crime seems to go up nearly all of it the border is porous we have people pouring into the country the islamic state has made clear they are making use of our porous border and our willingness to harm ourselves by bringing in refugees that will include islamic state terrorists i think we need to take them seriously this article from june 28 from james carafano says flash back 3 years ago and remember when the secretary of homeland security declared the border has never been stronger well if what is going on at americas border with mexico is a success americans should shudder to think what failure looks like unaccompanied children crossing the border is up over 70 percent this year other categories and overall numbers are on the rise as well reflecting significant increases since 2014 and it is not just the numbers that are troubling to americans they are worried about national security threats on the southern border the groups are not just drug mafiasthey smuggle steal hijack rob or kill anything that makes a profit and it is not just an american problem by some estimates since 2007 the cartels are responsible for over 100 000 deaths and this is something that a number of my republican friends especially all of us from texas were having meetings about off the record with the director of homeland security and the white house demanding that president bush do a better job of securing our border and they were actually making progress up through 2008 then along came a new president and they keep telling us like this quote the border has never been stronger but the true facts belie that we have diseases popping up where they shouldnt in places where immigrants who have come in illegally have come and then if that is not bad enough this report from the federalist unitedstates negligence is feeding isis global appeal and it goes on and documents in the article here just how bad negligence in this administration has become i couldnt agree more with one of the later paragraphs and the subtitle weakness invites aggression muslim extremists around the world see that the american government and much of american society do not take this threat radical islam seriously parenthetically they talk about guns guns guns and wont look at the person carrying or using the gun the article says and cant or wont admit its theological origins rather than feeling on the run isis and the men it inspires to jihad must feel emboldened by this the left continually insists as muslim advocates president farhana khera did at least weeks senate hearing that by talking about islam in any capacity when discussing terrorism we are playing into isis hands the argument is that groups like isis and alqaeda want nothing more than for the west and moderate muslims to attack islam to what end isnt clear alqaeda may be frustrated it cant get the west to believe its motiveslast week it released a special edition of their magazine inspire this is al qaeda in which it called on jihadists to avoid targeting places and crowds where minorities are generally found so their religious motives for the terrorist attack will be believed but this isnt because alqaeda wants to instigate animosity between muslims and the west its doing that by inspiring jihad it simply wants the west especially those of us in the united states to believe alqaeda is fighting a holy war they believe they are fighting a holy war after the paris nightclub attacks in november kerry vaguely described isis motives arguing that while the charlie hebdo attacks perhaps had a legitimacy or rationale that you could attach yourself to indicating that murder is an appropriate reaction to insulting mohammed the november attacks were absolutely indiscriminate well this administration they do not understand the importance of securing the border they dont understand if they are going to avoid being complete hypocrites that if you are going to outlaw whatever gun a radical islamist uses to terrorize and kill americans if you are going to outlaw those then next you have to file the bill that makes the possession or purchase of a pressure cooker illegal and we really need to go back to 9 11 they used box cutters because if we are going to totally continue in this mode of refusing to recognize the problem with the murderer the islamic terrorist murderer and look at only whatever weapon that murderer is using then we are going to have to keep banning things i am sure machetes like were used to kill hundreds of thousands of people in rwanda we will have to outlaw them at some point it will go on and on as long as we continue to ignore the true threat here to american lives in radical islam and i know it sounds good no fly no buy that is clever that is cute but then when you have the attorney general in front of your committee and you are wanting to know what do you use to decide who is on the nofly list you cant get answers from the prior attorney general you cant get answers from the administration they wont tell you but they want americans to get behind this movement to allow a bureaucrat unelected behind the sceneswe dont even know who is doing itto make a list of people they dont want to have guns maybe we could get lois lerner over there to help i am sure a lot of people would love that make a list of who you dont want to have guns unfortunately we have seen the numbers that indicate most of the people on the nofly list are people this administration should not have let into the country if we are going to do something about the murderers lets get serious about it lets address radical islam lets secure our border lets start enforcing the gun laws we have and lets allow the fbi to be trained to recognize what a radical islamist believes what they are reading what they are doing who they are following online what mosque they are going to where more people are radicalized those are important things and until this administration allows that to happen we are going to keep losing precious american lives it has to stop and if it is not guns it is pressure cookers box cutters machetes underwear bombs we find out you know these terrorists these radical islamists they have learned how to make bombs and on top of all of that we have the president determined to release as many people who want to kill americans as he possibly can out of guantanamo bay under the rules of war for civilized societies when someone declares war on your country and you capture any of their warriors you hold on to them in civilized society until such time as their friends and allies say we are no longer at war then you let them go and if their friends and allies keep fighting for 30 years you hold on to them for 30 years and then maybe they can help persuade them to stop fighting but you dont let warriors go while the war is still going on because as we have seenand it was repugnant to me to have a spokesman for this administration say basically well we cant say that people we have released from guantanamo have killed americans but i guess we could say in essence that people we have releasedwell that americans would not be dead if we hadnt released certain people from guantanamo my word lets quit playing the games and quit releasing people who want to kill americans who are at war with us who were at war with us when they were captured and whose friends are still at war with us lets hold them at guantanamo until their friends say we are no longer at war then they can be released unless they have committed war crimes if they have then at that point we will try them for those crimes like nuremberg that is what a civilized society does you dont release warriors to go kill more americans while the war is going on i yield back the balance of my time"],

participate in these races come from all over the national capital region to participate in this really fun event the derby has become quite a tradition in washington the d c metropolitan area has

"from virginia for this legislation being brought to the house floor tonight the foreign aid authorization act first passed congress in 1961 if you mention foreign aid to many americans it raises their blood pressure members of our communities often are concerned about foreign aid to other countries because they are just not quite sure where that aid is going and what that aid is accomplishing it is important that we as members of the house of representatives legislatively communicate to america how americas money is being spent in foreign countries it is important that we are accountable and that that money that aid is accountable to the taxpayers it may shock you madam speakermaybe it wontbut congress has never passed a law requiring transparency and accountability of foreign aid i will use a different phrase we have never audited our foreign aid to see if it is working and to see what it is doing so people can see whether it is successful or not the american public is uninformed about how much we spend and why we spend that money a recent publish what you fund study rated half of unitedstates agencies in the poor category when it came to transparency of aid transparency is important because it sheds light on where the money is spent it is a lot harder to steal money if everybody knows where the money went and what it was for the american people have a right to know what we are doing with their money there are a lot of success stories but many americans dont know about them so it is important that we post that information and that the agencies that help in foreign aid assistance post that information on the web so we know who is getting the money and what they are doing with that money transparency will help foreign aid it will make it harder for bad actors to steal that aid it will make those who implement our programs work more vigilantly knowing the information will also be posted online it will educate the american public about all the ways our country is helping other people around the world as i said there are a lot of success stories where people are better off because america is helping them transparency by itself however wont save all of foreign aids problems but without transparency those problems will not be solved we also need to evaluate our foreign aid program so we know what works the key portions of this bill are transparency of the aid and evaluation of the aid evaluate that aid to see if it is working and if it is working may continue to do that aid evaluate aidif it is not working then we cut it off and do something else we have all heard about the boondoggles of foreign aid big infrastructure projects are especially prone to waste and mismanagement that is why it is so critically important that as part of this bill being implemented licensed engineers who know how to do these infrastructure projects are more involved with their expert input and operational skills let me give you some examples of where foreign aid has been mismanaged schools are being built by americans overseas but some of those schools never had a student attend them the special inspector for iraq reconstruction found out that at least 8 billion in american taxpayer dollars was lost to fraud waste and abuse 44 million was spent on a residential camp to house international police trainers the camp included an olympicsized swimming pool the problem is swimming pool and all it was never used the 43 million natural gas station in afghanistan was built by the department of defense when it built the same kind of gas station for 500 000 in pakistan let me explain that again american taxpayers built a 43 million natural gas station besides the enormous outrageous cost nobody ever used the gas station in afghanistan so rigorous evaluations of our foreign aid are important because they can tell us whether or not we are really making a lasting impact we have a long way to go and the state department really doesnt have a system in place to keep track of the dollars spent on evaluation of those projects the state department can only tell how much it plans to spend in the future but as soon as it spends that money on evaluations it has no way of tracking where the money went so the state department cant even tell how many evaluations were even done last year on the aid that we are already spending even in its policy the state department is moving in the wrong direction its new evaluation policy lowers the amount of evaluations that must be done usaid has some troubling signs as well usaid spent less money on evaluations in 2014 than it did in 2013 to solve some of these problems with transparency and with accountability of our foreign aid representative connolly and myself have introduced h r 3766 the foreign aid transparency and accountability act this bill requires the president to issue guidelines requiring tough evaluations and on transparency it codifies what is already being done and increases the amount of information required to be posted online including actual expenditures and evaluations so everyone knows what we are doing and whether it is working or not we need to be reporting on more foreign aid in a more understandable way the american people want to know where their aid is going what it is for and if that aid is effective transparency and

this one began when a visitor from massachusetts walked into my office jenny phillips had an interesting story to tell because her grandfather was ernest hemingways editor and longtime friend maxwell perkins she and her husband frank had traveled to cuba earlier that year to visit the finca vigia which the cubans had lovingly cared for and operated as a museum since hemingways death we are grateful to those cubans because there would be no hemingway house without their decades of devotion to his memory and his legacy in addition to touring the house and grounds jenny and frank also saw thousands of hemingway documents and photographs that were in boxes and containers in the basement most unknown to writers and researchers they recognized the priceless value of these papers to hemingway scholars worldwide but they also knew that the political divide between the united states and cuba made their preservation and accessibility a problem listening to her describe what was at stake we took the first steps that would result in a wonderful binational process to save hemingways documents preserve the architecture and physical structure of his home restore his famous boat the

that have made the restoration of hemingways house a personal passion they have dedicated time and talent materials and funding to this initiative for over a decade i would just like to mention a few

fruition and put the first cornerstones in place they are the ford foundation the j m kaplan fund the christopher reynolds foundation the stewart mott charitable trust and the rockefeller foundation next i would like to recognize the national trust for historic preservation which has recognized the finca vigia foundation in cuba as a unitedstates historic preservation sitethe only such site outside of the united statesand whose experience and technical expertise in preservation and cultural conservation have been invaluable i would especially like to note the contributions of richard moe the former president of the national trust and paul edmondson the current general counsel with the national trust for historic preservation several foundations and unitedstates companies have been involved directly in the preservation projects or in providing financial support for this work the lead sponsor for document conservation has been the emc corporation headquartered in hopkinton massachusetts and especially bill teuber chris goode and joel schwartz from the company emc also reached out to intel and emulex which also provided financial support to the project the lead sponsors for the construction of archival storage and conservation laboratories are the caterpillar foundation and caterpillar inc along with the at t foundation the ford foundation and american express unitedstates professionals who have been critical contributors and participants in the technical document conservation construction and architectural teams are william dupont the former chief

michael gurdak and his team from jones day have provided essential services throughout the project special recognition must also be paid to the tireless work and engagement of maryjo adams and robert vila maryjo is the executive director of the finca vigia foundation and is its very heart soul and beating blood without her efforts this project would not have been possible bob vila is a builder a wellknown tv host especially of the pbs program this old house and is a recognized building consultant bob has been involved on the ground in cuba with overseeing every phase of the restoration of hemingways house and grounds along with jenny phillips he is the cochair of the finca vigia foundation but more than anything we know that when bob is on site in cuba all is right with the world and if it isnt he will make sure that it is finally i would like to recognize the work of michael mershon who recently left my staff and who worked with me for over a decade on the hemingway project right now unitedstates and cuban technical teams are constructing a facility on the grounds to carry out onsite archival storage with wet and dry conservation laboratories known as the taller which means workshop in spanish this facility will ensure the longevity of the hemingway papers it will be the first building constructed in cuba using unitedstates materials and ingenuity since the 1950s the cuban ministry of culture views this project as a possible prototype to be replicated across the country in the preservation of cultural heritage the construction of this critical facility is possible because of the new regulations announced by president obama in december of 2014 with very little money and largely during a period of daunting obstacles created by a tense political climate the finca vigia foundation and its team of experts in close collaboration with cuban professionals and experts have done a great service for the american people the cuban people and indeed all of the people of the world with passion and professional skill they recognized that the life memory books papers and home of ernest hemingway are above politics and policies which are fleeting while art is eternal they understand that the legacy of ernest hemingway is a shared heritage belonging to both cubans and americans and in one of the best models of what can happen when americans and cubans collaborate they have made sure that it will never be lost i am so very grateful to jenny and frank phillips for walking into my office 13 years ago and sparking a remarkable and personal journey for me it has offered me the rare privilege to meet and work with so many extraordinary cubans and americans and to participate in preserving our shared heritage around the life and artistic achievements of ernest hemingway i cannot wait to see what the next chapter brings i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.00108259916305542, 0.5010825991630554, 1, "i was unavoidably detained had i been present i would
