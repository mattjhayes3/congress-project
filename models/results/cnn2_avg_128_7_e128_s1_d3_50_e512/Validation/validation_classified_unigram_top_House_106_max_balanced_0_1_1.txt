committed to promoting children first in the national agenda we look forward to hearing from mrs tipper gore the wife of the vice president on the mdrch 25 1999 issues of mental health services for children keeping that in mind i am very concerned with the budget as proposed by the majority leadership because our children must face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millennium we have got to invest in children this budget does not children cannot learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending in programs aimed at protecting the interests of children allow me to call the roll a program of which many members of this house have testified that they graduated from head start is being cut 501 million a 10 percent cut the wic program that provides for women infants and children being cut 425 million job corps which has allowed many inner city and rural community youth to find an opportunity out of the seat of degradation cut 141 million child care there is not a time that i go home to my district when women and men parents who say give me the ability to work provide child care and help me provide child care for my children sometimes onethird of their income 119 million the summer youth program where a mother gave me the good news of her young person who had graduated through the

investment let us support the democratic alternative and invest in our children i rise in opposition to fy 2000 budget resolution offered by the majoritys leadership i come in the spirit of hershey and bipartisanism i come to request a budget that protects the social security trust fund for americas citizens i rise to request a budget thact will protect the medicare trust fund we must authorize a budget that will protect the social security trust fund while women tend to collect benefits over a longer period than men because of a greater life expectancy women on average receive lower monthly social security benefits since they have lower earnings and are more likely to be widowed or unmarried in retirement the majoritys budget proposal does not protect women or children or the social security trust fund under this budget proposalprograms directed toward improving the quality of life for women and children are the first programs to be reduced and cut in order to give a tax break to the wealthy the majority is suggesting that their budget proposal will save 100 of the social security surplus but 0 of that money goes to the social security trust fund and 0 goes towards strengthening medicare this simply is not true domestic programs are not a priority in this budget resolution offered by the majority we must authorize a budget that will appropriate financial resources to reduce the average classroom size to promote a learning environment and to modernize public schools educating americas children should be our number one priority our children must be prepared to face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millenium children can not learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending and programs aimed at protecting the interest of our children 425 1 million would be slashed from the wic budget head start would becut by approximately 501 4 million ard liheap funding would be reduced by 109 million nevertheless the majoritys budget resolution reserves 800 billion for tax cuts we must authorize a budget that will protect and extend the medicare trust fund this budget must ensure that patients will have access to high quality healthcare by guaranteeing important protections such as access to the specialists coverage for emergency medical services and

[0.0, 1.0, 1, "it is not my intention to use the entire hour this evening i wanted to spend some time though talking about hmo reform or managed care reform one of the things that i want to really stress is that there is a major difference between the approach that the democrats have been taking on the issue of hmo reform versus the approach of the republican leadership a lot of times i worry that americans and our constituents think that what we are proposing on both sides of the aisle is essentially the same and that everyone is trying to do something to protect patients rights during this managed care reform debate but i just think it is important to stress the differences i really feel very strongly that the patients bill of rights the democratic bill that has been put forward and is cosponsored by almost every member on the democratic side really protects patients rights whereas the republican leadership bills that have been put forward both in this congress and in the previous congress really do not do an adequate job of protecting patients and too often look towards the interests of the insurance industry instead in the last session of congress in the last 2 years in 1997 and 1998 there was some debate on the issue of hmo reform but the issue was essentially left unfinished in the 105th congress in the last congress on the house side the democrats patients bill of rights was defeated by just five votes when it came to the floor it was considered on the floor as a substitute to the republican leaderships managed care bill which did pass and which in my opinion was really not a good piece of legislation and did not do anything significant to protect patients in fact the republican leadership in the house has reintroduced a bill in this session of congress that is virtually identical to what it moved last year on the senate side the senate republicans in the socalled help committee approved a managed care bill which really in my opinion is a sham reform bill and does not allow patients to sue the insurance companies but does allow the insurance companies and not the doctors and patients to define what is medically necessary what types of procedures what length of stay what kind of operations would be performed and would be acceptable under an individual insurance policy i just wanted to if i could take a little time this evening to talk about why this republican bill that passed the senate the republican leadership bill in the senate really does not do an adequate job of trying to protect patients rights if you look at the bill that passed the senate or that came out of committee i should say in the senate this year it leaves out more than 100 million americans twothirds of those with private health insurance it fails to grant key protections needed by children women persons with disabilities and others with chronic conditions or special health care needs and it allows medical decisions to continue to be made by insurance company executives instead of by health care professionals and patients the main difference that i have tried to point out between the democrats patients bill of rights and the republican leadership bills that have been sponsored in the house or in the senate really come down to two points and that is that the republican bills really leave it up to the insurance companies to decide what kind of treatment you are going to get and with regard to enforcement they do not have adequate enforcement because if you want to appeal a decision about your treatment that you felt that you should have a particular operation you should be able to stay an extra day or so in the hospital if you try that appeal there is really no process whereby you can appeal the decision of the insurance company and be successful and certainly if you suffer damages you cannot sue for those damages under the republican bill what the democrats tried to do on the senate side in committee in the help committee when this republican hmo bill came up they tried a number of times through amendments to improve the republican bill all those democratic amendments were essentially defeated but i wanted to give you a little idea if i could about the kinds of things that the democrats were trying to do to improve what was essentially a bad bill that did not provide adequate protections for patients in hmos the committee republicans in the senate rejected on a 108 party line vote an amendment by senator ted kennedy to extend the scope of the bill to all privately insured americans as i said the republican bill leaves more than 100 million people unprotected because most of its patient protections are narrowly applied to only one type of insurance and that is selffunded employer plans the committee republicans also rejected on the same 108 party line vote senator kennedys amendment on external appeals again as i mentioned before the republican bill does not create a truly independent external review of plan decisions so if you feel that you are not getting covered adequately and you try to appeal there really is no effective external appeal under the committee bill the republican bill the socalled external review is controlled by the hmos and contains loopholes to allow hmos to delay or prevent patients from appealing a bad medical decision by an hmo bureaucrat many hmo decisions could not even be appealed under the republican bill just to give you another idea of some of the examples i talked about the issue of medical necessity and how it is defined the committee republicans in the senate rejected again on a party line vote 108 an amendment offered by senator kennedy to define the term medical necessity and to prohibit hmos from arbitrarily interfering with medical decisions again just to give you an example of how this operates this amendment would have prevented insurers from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of the treating physician on issues relating to the manner in other words the length of stay in the hospital or the setting inpatient versus outpatient care it would have stopped hmos from overruling doctor and going against accepted and best practices of medicine the committee republicanpassed bill does nothing to protect patients when an insurance company bureaucrat tells them they must have a medical procedure on an outpatient basis or be discharged from the hospital prematurely the republican bill allows hmos to continue to define what is medically necessary giving them the ability to deny promised benefits another example the issue of emergency room care many of my constituents have complained to me that their hmo policy does not allow them to go to the emergency room when they think it is necessary or they have to go to a different hospital that is pretty far away if they want to go to an emergency room they cannot go to the hospital near where they live or where they work well senator murray tried to put in an amendment that again was rejected on a party line vote 108 to strengthen coverage for emergency care under the republican bill it is not clear whether a true prudent layperson standard applies to all of the plans covered prudent layperson says that if the average prudent person would think it was necessary to go to the emergency room then you can go to whatever emergency room is close by and readily available well many insurance policies many hmos do not allow that and so the democrats are saying we want to have that prudent layperson standard put into the hmo reform bill instead what happened is that in this case again the ability to apply that prudent layperson standard was rejected by the committee and what that means is that under the republican bill there still is no guarantee that you can go to the closest emergency room or that even if you go to the emergency room and later the hmo decides well you really should not have gone because it was not really an emergency that they can just deny coverage and say you shouldnt have gone to the emergency room therefore were not going to pay for the emergency room care another example that i think is important is with regard to specialists many of my constituents complain that their hmo reform bill does not provide them with access to specialists that they may need in a given circumstance senators harein and reed had an amendment to this republican bill that again was rejected along party lines that would ensure that patients have access to needed specialists under the republican bill patients could be charged more for outofnetwork specialty care even if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists within the plan so if you decide that you want to go to a doctor i will give you an example perhaps you want to go see a pediatrician but as many people know today that for children there are pediatric specialists for different areas of pediatrics under the republican bill if there is nobody that has that specialty and you decide that you want to see that kind of pediatrician for your child then you can go out of the network but you have to pay for it again what we were saying with this democratic amendment is that access to specialty care should be provided outside the hmo if there is no one within the hmo that has that specialty and is part of the network but again that was an amendment that was rejected i will only mention one more effort on the democrats part to try to improve this bad bill if you will and there are many others but i will only mention one other one and that was senator kennedys amendment again rejected on a 108 party line vote with regard to liability the republican bill fails to hold limos accountable when their actions result in injury or death i mentioned this before you cannot sue the republican plan would protect most hmos from liability even when someone becomes disabled or is killed senator kennedys amendment in the democrats patients bill of rights would allow 123 million patients who receive coverage through private employers to hold their hmos and health insurance plans accountable under state laws for their abuses this is one of the loopholes if you will in the current law and that is that if you are not covered by certain state laws and your health insurance comes from your private employer oftentimes you cannot sue we were trying to correct that as well if i could just say that basically what i am trying to point out tonight is that there are major differences here and that when we look at what is happening on the issue of hmo or managed care reform it is obviously important that we have an opportunity in this session of congress to get a vote on this issue one of the criticisms that i have of the republican leadership is that frankly it is now april almost may and they have not even allowed us to have any kind of a vote there has not been any movement in subcommittee in the committee on commerce that i am a member of or in the full committee to bring any kind of hmo or managed care reform to the floor so we need to at least start the movement but when that movement starts and when we do have an opportunity to vote on hmo reform we have to understand that there is a major difference between the patients bill of rights which is being brought forth by the democrats and the republican leadership proposal now you do not have to take my word for it one of the things that i think is important is that we look at some of the commentators and what they are saying about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on this issue but i wanted to read if i could all or some parts of an editorial that appeared in the new york times on saturday april 10 earlier this month that talked about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on the issue of patient rights just about everyone on capitol hill professes interest in producing legislation that protects patients from unfair health insurance practices but the prospect of actually passing meaningful protections as opposed to talking about it is uncertain president clinton tried to whip up support for democratic proposals but the republicans are balking at democratic plans as too burdensome on the managed care industry yet it is the democratic proposals that more fully reflect the recommendations of a presidential advisory commission to improve health plan quality the republican senate bill s 326 sponsored by senator jeffords of vermont is too limited to accomplish that purpose the bill which was approved by the senate help or health education labor and pensions committee on a straight party line vote of 108 contains some consumer protections but it is unacceptable because most of the provisions would apply only to 48 million individuals covered by plans in which large employers act as their own insurers leaving 110 million americans in other plans unprotected the republican bill would grant appeal rights to an additional 75 million privately insured individuals but those rights would be quite restrictive appeals to an external reviewer would be allowed only when an insurer refused to pay for a procedure on the grounds that it was not medically necessary or was experimental critics say this would give health plans power to limit appeals by simply asserting that a denial is not based on medical necessity it would exclude appeals where a plan unilaterally decided that the benefit was not covered under the contract even if medical judgments were involved in that contract interpretation the republican bill does not adequately ensure access to specialty care by allowing a patient to see an outofnetwork specialist if the plan has an insufficient number of specialists available both the senate democratic proposal which has white house support and a bipartisan bill sponsored by senators john chafee joseph lieberman and others would be substantially stronger in allowing external review of coverage disputes and defining medical necessity and in giving enrollees greater rights to take health plans to court the insurance lobby has already embarked on a media blitz to defeat any new regulations as too costly but consumer protections under the democratic plan would increase health plan costs by only 2 8 percent according to congressional budget office estimates made last year health plans should be made to deliver what they promise their enrollees and held accountable when they fail i think that new york times editorial really sums up what i am trying to say tonight which is the fact of the matter is that if the patients bill of rights the democratic patients bill of rights would be substantially stronger in almost every aspect of managed care reform over the republican proposal now i just wanted to briefly mention again the important areas where the patients bill of rights a democratic bill of rights really provides for a very good protection for patients once again and most importantly the democratic patients bill of rights allows doctors and patients rather than insurance company bureaucrats to make medical decisions using the principles of good medicine in addition it would first guarantee access to needed health care specialists the democratic bill provides access to emergency room services when and where the need arises the democratic bill provides continuity of care protections to assure patient care if a patients health care provider is dropped the democrats patients bill of rights gives access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process and the democratic patients bill of rights assures that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment options and not be gagged because the insurance company says that you cannot talk about something that is not covered the patients bill of rights would also assure that women have direct access to ob gyn and finally and almost as important really as the medical necessity issue is that the democrats patients bill of rights provides an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been maimed or die as a result of health plan actions i sound very partisan this evening and i do not mean to suggest that there are not republican members on the other side of the aisle that are supportive of the patients bill of rights or the types of protections that i think that are needed in a comprehensive hmo reform bill i know that there are members on the other side that would like to see these types of protections provided under the law but the bottom line is that the republican leadership which is in charge of the house keeps producing legislation or keeps proposing legislation both in the house and in the senate that does not adequately protect patients and i think it is very important that we not only move ahead in this session of congress and quickly on hmo reform but that we move ahead with an hmo reform that adequately protects patients rights that is comprehensive and addresses what i consider the major issue that my constituents and most americans seem to be concerned about at this time"],

couple where both the husband and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because it is the right thing to do so again i urge a yes vote i invite every democrat to join with

strengthen and make our schools safef we want to strengthen social security by locking away 100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax

come upon the historic opportunity to balance the budget without spending one penny of seniors social security trust fund for nearly 4 decades the raid on social security has gone on taking over 850 billion in social security funds and spending them on unrelated government programs 168 days ago just over 5 months this house passed my social security lockbox legislation by an overwhelming 416 to 12 vote the passage of this social security lockbox legislation showed that house republicans and democrats agree that social security dollars should not be spent on programs unrelated to social security congress made the commitment to stop the raid on social security shortly later however president clinton joined our bipartisan effort and committed the administration to protecting social security that was over 5 months ago unfortunatelyv i am afraid today is a different story while house republicans are continuing to honor our steadfast commitment to protect seniors social security i have great concerns about the recent actions of the clintongore white house and congressional democrats the current budget situation requires that every increase in spending be offset currently if spending is not offset it is drawn directly from seniors social security dollars over the past few weeks president clinton has vetoed five appropriations bills because he says they do not spend enough yet the president has not offered a single solid proposal to pay for those spending increases it appears the president may be willing to spend social security dollars to pay for his spending projects congress and the president are faced with a very clear choice ask federal agencies to save one penny just one penny of a dollar in waste fraud or abuse so we can protect social security or give in to the big washington spenders and raid seniors social security dollars amazingly enough there are still people in washington that do not believe the federal government can tighten its belt by just 1 percent but the american people know the truth a recent poll conducted by the national taxpayers union revealed let me show my colleagues this poll revealed that over 84 percent of americans believe that there is not just 1 percent waste in government but they felt there was at least 5 percent of waste in unneeded spending in the federal spending surely if 84 percent of the american people believe that there is at least 5 percent of waste the president and the congress can work together to find just 1 percent or one penny of waste in order to protect social security dollars so many seniors so many seniors rely upon let me present my colleagues with some examples of waste fraud and abuse that we have found in the federal government the national park service spent 1 million to build an outhouse at glacier national park in montana the expense was explained by the outhouses remote location the outhouse is located nearly 7 miles from the nearest road and it took hundreds of horse trips and more than 800 helicopter drops to get the construction materials to the site another one erroneous medicare payments that waste over 20 billion annually another the department of

in fiscal year 1998 about 5 percent of the entire program budget let me close with this for a moment and that is delays in disposing of more than 41 000 hud properties cost taxpayers more than 1 million per day these are all examples of how congress and the president can find one penny 1 percent out of a dollar in waste fraud and abuse in the federal government we are all in this together we want to work with the president and vice president gore to find this 1 percent so that we can protect social security dollars we will not however under any circumstances allow the clintongore

than the republican budget because in the later years my republican colleagues had to choose between defense spending and tax cuts what do my colleagues think mr speaker they chose the tax cuts meanwhile the democratic budget still manages to provide some balanced tax cuts and keep our economy from slipping back into deficit the republican budget on the other hand will create a whole new deficit by the year 2014 the democratic budget does more to reduce class size and modernize our schools than the republican budget which will cut spending for head start cut spending for pell grants and cut money for work study the democratic budget protects important programs like wic which the republican budget cuts by so much that 1 2 million women infants and children will lose their benefits next year 16 400 of them live in my home state of massachusetts the wic program provides essential nutrition and education during the early years of the childrens development in order to make sure that they start school ready to learn if we do not give them good nutrition when they are very young we lose our chance forever some of my democratic colleagues tried to make sure that we got that chance but this rule does not make in order the defazio amendment on the progressive budget the clement amendment on the veterans budget or the mink amendment on education this rule does make in order the shadeggcoburn amendment which some people are equating with president clintons budget they say it reflects some cbo comparison i want to make something perfectly clear the shadeggcoburn amendment looks as much like president clintons budget as i look like gwyneth paltrow looking at this budget we would think that my republican colleagues have very sharp memories when it comes to bad habits that gave us the budget deficits in the 1980s and the tripling of our national debt now that our budget finally is in the black we should be very very careful about repeating those mistakes so i urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question if the previous question is defeated we will make in order the clement amendment to take care of our american veterans our veterans deserve every bit of care we can give them this country made them a promise this country should live up to that promise yesterdays unitedstatesa today says if your member of congress comes home this weekend bragging about having adopted a responsible federal budget dont you believe it so i urge my colleagues to defeat the republican budget todays vote gives us an unprecedented chance to protect social security to protect medicare for the next generation let us not let that chance go by i reserve the balance of my time"], [2.9824602165717806e-07, 2.9824602165717806e-07, 0, "it is my privilege to represent a very diverse district in illinois i represent the south side of chicago and the south suburbs in cook and will counties a lot of bedroom communities and farm towns too when one represents such a diverse district they learn to listen to the concerns back home and try and respond to those concerns i have had one very common message that i hear in the city and in the suburbs and in the country in the diverse district that i represent and that message is pretty simple people back home want us to work together and find solutions to the challenges that we are facing i am proud to say that over the last 41 2 years we have listened and we have responded to those concerns to work to change how washington works to make washington more responsive to the folks back home i am proud to say that we accomplished some things we were told we could not do we were told we could not balance the budget we were told we could not balance the budget and lower taxes we were told we could never reform our welfare system but we did i am proud to say in the last 4 years t jiat we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years producing a projected 2 8 trillion surplus of extra tax revenues we lowered taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years and 3 million illinois children now qualify for the 500 per child tax credit back home in my state of illinois that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming here to washington we also reformed our welfare system which was failing beyond imagination we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation as a result of our welfare reform we have seen the welfare rolls in illinois cut in half we have balanced the budget we lowered taxes for the middle class we reformed our welfare system that is pretty good folks often say those are real accomplishments but what is next on congress agenda we are working to continue responding to the issues and concerns of the folks back home and we have a simple agenda in this congress the republican agenda is simple good schools low taxes and a secure retirement for all america and our budget that were working on today reflects that i am often asked some questions in town meetings back home one of the most important ones we addressed this year i am often asked by folks whether at a senior citizens center a union hall or a vfw when are the politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund that is a pretty important basic question of course washington has raided the social security trust fund for over 30 years back when lbj was president washington began that process and bad habits are hard to break i am proud to say this republican congress is going to lock away 100 percent of social security revenues for social security only let me point out here what this means and i will compare the republican budget with the clintongore budget on social security the republican budget of course locks away 100 percent of social security for social security i would point out that 137 billion of the social security surplus under our lockbox will stay in social security now the president talks about 62 percent of the surplus for social security and what the president and vice president gore are talking about doing is spending 38 percent of social security on othei things that is what the folks back home call raiding the social security trust fund republicans say 100 percent of social security for social security clintongore they say 62 percent and spend the rest on other things we want to put a stop to that and that is why the lockbox proposal republicans are moving through the congress is so important because it is the first step we should take as we work to save social security let us lock away social security first before we consider any other reforms another question i am often asked is no one ever talks about the national debt let me point out that in this budget this year we are in a position where we are going to be able to pay down 1 8 trillion of the national debt last year we paid off 50 billion this year we are projected to pay off 100 billion of the national debt and under our budget we propose the potential of paying down 1 8 trillion of the national debt saving social security paying down the debt i am also asked at the union halls and the vfws and the other community centers and the grain elevators in the district that i represent when are we going to do something about the tax burden on families today the average family in illinois sends 40 percent of their income to washington and springfield and the local courthouse in taxes the tax burden today for the middle class is at its highest level ever in peacetime history twentyone percent of our gross domestic product goes to washington that is the highest level ever in peacetime history and it is putting a tremendous squeeze on middle class families i believe as we work to lower the tax burden on middle class families we should simplify the tax code we should work to bring fairness to the tax code beginning with the elimination of the marriage tax penalty it is simply wrong that under our tax code 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married let us lower taxes by simplifying the tax code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty let us pay down the national debt and let us save social security"], [8.344650268554688e-07, 0.9999991655349731, 1, "when i was first elected to congress in 1992 i promised my constituents that i would do everything in my power to abstain from the spending spree that had run up the largest budget deficit in american history i consistently voted against irresponsible spending bills and for legislation to balance the budget and bring our fiscal house back to order today were reaping the benefits of our fiscal restraint we are now in our third year of budget surpluses and unprecedented economic progress the united states is enjoying the longest economic expansion in history the lowest poverty rate in twenty years and the lowest unemployment rate since the 1970s whereas in 1992 we suffered under the weight of a 290 billion budget deficit today we are buoyed by a 211 billion surplus and yet it seems that our republican colleagues have forgotten the lessons we learned just eight short years ago and are spending the surpluses as fast as they come in last year the republicans tried to enact their tax cut agenda at a cost of 929 billion over 10 years this sweeping bill failed because it was obvious that such a large package shoved aside all other priorities and put the nations fiscal health in jeopardy this year republicans have devised a more clever political strategy of breaking up their tax agenda allowing them to focus attention on the same attractions of each part of their agenda while obscuring the total cost but the cost is the same so far this year republicans have pushed through tax cuts that would eat up 739 billion of the budget surpluses when you add this to other tax cuts and spending increases they vow to bring up the republicans will have spent 88 billion more than is available once social security and medicare are protected today congress is on its way to invading medicare as well while we are currently in an era of surpluses we must not forget that medicares fiscal future is troubled according to the most recent trustees report part a will begin running cash deficits again by 2010 totaling neariy 7 trillion by 2040 despite these looming deficits the republicans have introduced yet another tax cut that robs the medicare program of roughly 100 billion in dedicated revenues over the next ten years and 464 billion through 2024 the social security benefits tax relief act repeals a portion of the tax on social security benefits thereby eliminating a dedicated source of revenues to the medicare trust fund without this income medicare part a will go into the red again five years earlier than under current law the result will be a significant threat to the viability of the medicare program for future generations and an even greater squeeze on hospitals and other health care providers dependent upon medicare payments h r 4865 purports to replace the lost revenue to the medicare trust fund from the projected onbudget surplus however while the revenue loss to the medicare trust fund is guaranteed the budget surplus exists only in projections and faces many other competing demands furthermore the revenue loss to the medicare trust fund would be permanent while the projected budget surpluses are temporary once the projected surpluses run out the medicare trust fund will be left with a large hole unless a future congress is willing to raise taxes or cut other programs perhaps most egregious like other republican tax cuts h r 4865 only benefits the wealthiest americans the national council of senior citizens calls h r 4865 an irresponsible political gesture to upper income persons which will have severe consequences for the social security system and the solvency of the medicare part a trust fund the massive amount of general revenues that would be consumed by this bill will leave fewer resources extending the solvency of the medicare program and creating a medicare prescription drug benefit the democratic substitute amendment on the other hand provides the same tax relief as the republican bill but offers it to more seniors at about half the cost whereas the republican bill only benefits the wealthiest 20 percent of social security recipients the democratic substitute would provide tax relief to 95 percent of seniors rather than eliminating the tax for all seniors the democratic substitute keeps the tax in place for only the very wealthiestsingles earning more than 80 000 and couples earning more than 100 000 a year the democratic substitute is also more fiscally responsible unlike the republican bill the democratic substitute protects social security and medicare by conditioning the tax cut on a certification from the secretary of the treasury that the onbudget surplus is sufficient to replenish the lost tax revenue thus it cant go into effect in years in which there is not enough of an onbudget surplus to replace lost revenues we are at a historic fork in the road if we continue down the path of irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthy there will be nothing left for shoring up medicare and social security enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or paying down the public debt i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the democratic substitute and no on the underlying bill congress must reverse its course and get back on the road to fiscal discipline"],

president clintons 1996 reelection campaign and how the clinton administration either intentionally or through incompetence has irreparably damaged and compromised the security of every man woman and child in the united states last summer during president clintons trip to china jiang zemin the president of china told him that he had no involvement in campaign fundraising in the united states and president clinton took his word for it in that july 2 1998 press conference president clinton said they looked into that and he was obviously certain and i do believe him that he had not ordered or authorized or approved such a thing and that he could find no evidence that anybody in governmental authority had done that giving illegal campaign contributions to the democratic national committee or the presidents reelection committee why would president clinton say that mr speaker the new york times reported in may that johnny chung was given 300 000 by ms liu chaoying a chinese aerospace executive who is a lieutenant colonel in the peoples liberation army in communist army and her father at one time was the head of the chinese peoples liberation army in april of 1996 27 months before president clintons meeting with president jiang of china sandy berger the head of the national security council was briefed that china had stolen w88 nuclear warhead designs neutron bomb data and that a spy might still be passing secrets to china at los alamos one of our nuclear research facilities now the w88 nuclear warhead design is a miniaturized nuclear warhead and you can put as many as 10 of them on one missile so you can hit 10 cities with one missile launched from china thereby endangering as many as 50 or 60 million americans and the neutron bomb data that kind of information would allow an enemy of the united states communist china to launch a missile at the united states with a neutron bomb warhead and when it explodes kills everybodyin the city but it does not destroy the infrastructure the roads the bridges or the buildings now sandy berger the head of the nsc would have had to have told the president about this why would president clinton say thatc lie beieved president jiang of china on april 8 1999 at a joint press conference with president clinton when communist chinas prime minister zhu rongji was here hp was asked about chinas theft of unitedstates nuclear secrets and prime minister zhu said i have no knowledge whatsoever of any charge of any allegation of espionage or the theft of nuclear technology and i do not believe such story and president clinton responded china is a big country with a big government and i can only say that america is a big country with a big government and occasionally things happen in this country and in this government that i do not know anything about and he was indicating that the stealing of this technology and the illegal campaign contributions thatwere authorized by the leaders of the communist chinese government could have happened without their knowledge if that happens in communist china they either shoot them or put them in prison so it is disingenuous for the president to say that he believed him when he knew full well that this was taking place in july of 1997 a year before his meeting with president jiang and 27 months before his meeting with prime minister zhu the administration acknowledges that nsc director sandy berger briefed the president told him about weaknesses in our nuclear laboratories and about chinas spying so when president clinton met with president jiang and prime minister zhu he had already been briefed by nsc director berger sometime before about the possibility of spying and espionage taking place at our nuclear facilities before the president met with zhu the l a times reported that johnny chung had testified under oath that he was directed to make illegal campaign contributions to the presidents reelection campaign by general ji shengde who met with him three times and ordered that 300 000 be directed to chung for political contributions and that there were other conduits other people that they were working with to get money into the presidents reelection campaign and to the democratic national committee now johnny chung was a friend of the president he was in the white house 50 times he brought other people in communist leaders to meet with the president and he was one of the major conduits of bringing illegal campaign contributions into this country general ji shengde was the head of the chinese communist military intelligence the equivalent of our defense intelligence agency in this country and he was the one that was giving the order to funnel these illegal campaign contributions from communist china into the presidents reelection campaign and into the democrat national committee now why would president clinton suggest that maybe the chinese leadership did not know about the spying at los alamos why would he say that when they do something in china as i said before they either shoot them or throw them in jail now regarding chinese espionage in april of 1996 27 months before president clinton accepted president jiangs denial and 3 years before he suggested that chinas spying might be the fault of big government the department of energys chief of intelligence notra trulock told national security advisor sandy berger the head of the nsc that china had stolen both w88 nuclear warhead designs that is the miniature nuclear warhead that they can put 10 of them on one missile and neutron bomb data that a spy might still be passing those secrets to china from los alamos our nuclear research facility according to energy officials who took part in the meeting and read highly classified materials used to prepare for it sandy berger was also told how the stolen technology could fit int o beijings overall nuclear strategy and how the w88 technology could be used as part of a plan to rely on the mobility of trucklaunched missiles with small warheads to better survive a counternuclear attack by the united states according to the new york times energy officials said the briefing was a culmination of a 5month interagency study of the w88 theft and related issues and it was pretty was a pretty specific briefing one american official who was present said that sandy berger was even told that investigators had identified a prime suspect at los alamos in the theft and would shortly turn their information over to the fbi for a formal criminal inquiry why did sandy berger the head of the nsc appearing on nbcs meet the press last month say the information he was told about 3 years ago was very general and very preliminary why did he say we did not have a suspect in the theft of the w88 technology why did he say that we did not know who we did not really know how and we did not really know what we know at the end of the briefing that i just talked about according to officials that were present notra trulock referred to a report from a chinese source which had been provided to the department of energy by the fbi in march of 1996 over 3 years ago the chinese source indicated that officials inside chinas intelligence service were boasting about how they had just stolen secrets from the uwnited states and had used themto improve beijings neutron bomb the source further suggested that chinese agents solved a 1988 design problem by coming back to the united states in 1995 to steal more secrets the source who in the past has drovided reliable inforirao o ever detailed how the information was transferred from the united states to communist china according to one official the intelligence about the neutron bomb was hot off the press and it was included in the briefing to warn the white house of the possibility of continuing chinese espionage in november of 1996 almost 1 years after first suspecting the theft of nuclear secret from los alamos charles b curtis the deputy secretary for energy ordered a series of security measures to be carried out on a straight timetable during the next several months none of these measures were carried out until september of 1998 almost 2 years later and there was a threat and a strong indication that espionage had taken place and our top secrets were being stolen by the communist chinese why did we wait 2 years why did they not implement those series of security measures in march of 1997 4 months before president clinton was scheduled to visit china the energy departments acting secretary for defense programs victor reis and the acting director for nonproliferation kenneth baker prevented notra trulock when he saw further evidence that the chinese had other ongoing spy operations at the weapons lab and he asked to meet with secretary of energy federico pefia they kept him from briefing secretary pefia for 4 months why in april of 1997 when the fbi requested a wiretap to be put on the phone of the conversations of wen ho lee the chief suspect in the theft of americas w88 miniaturized warhead technology the nuclear technology they were turned down by the justice department why would the justice department turn down this request for electronic technology to be put on this gentlemans phone when they thought and highly suspected and even knew that he was giving top secret nuclear technology to the chinese communists that endangered every man woman and child in this country why would the justice department not allow electronic technology and wiretaps to be put on his phone why and who at the justice department turned down this request this guy was accused of stealing americas most advanced nuclear technology why was this request turned down why in august of 1997 fbi director louis freeh told energy department officials that the bureau did not have enough evidence to arrest wen ho lee but that mr lee could now be removed from his position without harming their investigation and that doe was to determine whether or not to keep lee on since the case was not as important as what damage he might do or continue to do by accessing additional information why did the department of energy keep lee on with fbi approval retaining his security clearances until december of 1998 about 2 years later when he was moved to a nonclassified area and took a lie detector test for the first time why again in 1997 in july a year before his meeting with president jiang and 21 months before his meeting with prime minister zhu sandy berger the head of the nsc received a second detailed briefing about chinas spying and soon after told president clinton about weaknesses at the laboratories and about chinas spying in august of 1997 gary samore the senior national security council official assigned to the china spy case asked now get this asked the cia director to seek an alternative analysis on how china developed its smaller warheads in other words he did not want to talk about them being stolen from los alamos through espionage he wanted to find out an alternative analysis from the cia on how they might have gotten this technology immediately after he gotthis briefing from notra trulock in august of 1997 why when presented with such overwhelming evidence of chinese espionage did gary samore at the national security council seek to downplay the significance of the information asking the cia to come up with another explanation about chinas advances why in may of 1998 notra trulock energy departments director of intelligence was demoted to acting deputy director of intelligence after he made a third report to the energy department inspector general about a steady pattern of suppression of counterintelligence issues somebody was trying to keep a lid on all this mr speaker in july 1998 the same month that president clinton was meeting with chinas president jiang when the house intelligence committee requested an update on the spy case from notra trulock trulock testified that acting energy secretary elizabeth moler ordered him not to go to the panel for fear that the information would be used to attack president clintons china policy why did elizabeth moler do this the chinese thefts of unitedstates nuclear secrets according to paul redmund the cias chief spy hunter were quote far more damaging to national security than aldrich ameshe is the spy who is now in jailand the spying would turn out to be as bad as the rosenbergs now you recall the rosenbergs were the ones who gave nuclear secrets to the russians and the soviet union back during and after world war 11 both of them were executed for giving that nuclear technology to the soviets so that they could build their nuclear missiles that were directed at the united states and he said this mr redmund that this spying would turn out to be as bad or worse or as bad as the rosenberg case you can see how really bad this is at the same time that china was conducting its highly successful espionage operations against the united states the committee on government reform which i chair for 2 years has known about and tracked millions of dollars that were given to the democrat party and the presidents reelection committee that can be directly traced to hong kong macao indonesia south america and communist china long before president clinton met with president jiang and long before he met with prime minister zhu we knew for a long time that chinas head of military intelligence general ji shengde had been pulling the strings for a massive conglomerate called china resources which unitedstates intelligence agencies have said operates fronts for the peoples liberation army in hong kong and worldwide for a long time we have known that china resources has joint ventures with the indonesiabased international firm called the lippo group we have also known that the lippo group is run by mochtar and james riady we have known that the ethnic chinese james riady is a close friend of the presidents and has frequently visited him at the white house he was also instrumental in getting john huang appointed to a very important position at the commerce department and later at the democrat national committee we have known that james riadys chief adviser on political donations was john huang who is a former employee of the lippo group and who accepted this job at the commerce department and then left the commerce department to work at the democrat national committee where with the help of james riady and the lippo group and mochtar he collected nearly 3 million in illegal campaign contributions for the democrat party and the presidents reelection committee we have in our possession checks copies of checks which represent illegal contributions to the democrat party drawn from accounts in the lippo bank which is controlled by the riady family it is now being reported that johnny chung who gave more than 360 000 to the democrat party has told a grand jury that some of the money he contributed to the democrat party came from chinas head of military intelligence the very same people that wanted this nuclear technology general ji shengde general ji is the man in the chinese military most likely to be directing chinas spy operations and most likely to be interested in americas nuclear secrets it now appears that general ji was the mastermind behind chinas efforts to get the clintongore team reelected johnny chung has reportedly told a grand jury he was coordinating efforts to funnel money into the campaign along with others according to general ji is it possible that he was working with john huang and charlie trie as well johnny chung john huang and charlie trie together raised over 3 million in illegal donations that we know of that have been linked to the bank of china it is important to repeat that on july 2 1998 during president clintons trip to china when he was asked to comment on his discussions with president jiang zemin about chinas involvement in campaign fundraising in the united states president clinton said they looked into that and he was obviously certain and i do believe him that he had not ordered or authorized or approved such a thing the illegal contributions and that he could find no evidence that anybody in governmental authority had done that the president said he believed that president clinton at his own press conference on march 19 1998 in response to the question can you assure us the american people that under your watch no valuable secrets were lost and he said quote can i tell you there has been no espionage at the lab since i have been president i can tell you that no one has reported to me they suspect such a thing has occurred on april 8 1999 at a joint press conference with president clinton when chinas prime minister zhu rongji was asked about chinas theft of nuclear secrets zhu said i have no knowledge whatsoever of any charge of any allegation of espionage or the theft of nuclear technology and i dont believe such a story this is the prime minister of china president clinton responded china is a big country with a big government and i can only say that america is a big country with a big government and occasionally things happen in this government that i do not know anything about how could president clinton who knew at least 1 year before meeting with president jiang and probably as early as april of 1996 about chinese spying and had all this information about illegal chinese efforts to funnel money into the 1996 clintongore reelection efforts say i do believe president jiang it is just almost disingenuous it is inconceivable that president clinton did not know about chinas espionage and chinas funneling of illegal contributions into this reelection campaign when he met with prime minister zhu how could the president who had been briefed by sandy berger in july of 1997 and probably as early as april of 1996 about chinese spying suggest that maybe chinas spying was the result of big government and that maybe chinas leadership did not know about their spying at los alamos wen ho lee we know had not only been involved in that spying at least that is what we believe now and he has already taken some lie detector tests and is still under investigation we also know that he called convicted spy peter lee at the livermore laboratories where a neutron bomb was being researched some time ago how could the president say that this was a result of big government it is impossible that the chinese leadership did not know about this spying you get shot in china when you do something like that without telling the leadership on march 7 1997 president clinton said i dont believe you can find any evidence of the fact that i had changed government policy solely because of a contribution in february of 1998 5 months before he met president jiang and 14 months before he met prime minister zhu president clinton ignored strenuous objections from the department of justice which was investigating the loral corporation for an unauthorized technology transfer to china and granted loral a waiver for official transfers of essentially the same missile technology to china that loral was being criminally investigated for giving to china without authorization in 1996 bernard schwartz the chairman of loral corporation contributed over 1 365 million to various democratic accounts including the reelection of the president in a march interview with cnns wolf blitzer when questioned about chinas spying at los alamos vice president gore said the law enforcement agencies pursued it aggressively with our full support on march 14 1999 sandy berger asserted that upon learning of chinas nuclear espionage the administration quote imposed and enforced the strictest controls on china of any country except those for which we have embargoes such as libya end quote if the vice president and nsc director sandy berger are right why after showing deceptive answers in his first lie detector test in december of 1998 did it take the clinton administration another 2 months to give mr lee a second test after failing that second test why did it take them another month to get rid of him why did elizabeth moler who ordered notra trulock not to brief the house intelligence committee say that she could not recall being told about trulocks request for a briefing even when a memorandum from mr trulock concerning the briefing request was found in the safe in her office after she left her job at the energy department if what the vice president and sandy berger say is true why within 2 months after becoming energy secretary in january of 1993 when keith fultz assistant comptroller general with the general accounting office briefed hazel oleary and strongly recommended that the department of energy improve controls over foreign visitors to doe weapons laboratories and urged oleary to seek a further briefing about espionage at doe laboratories from unitedstates intelligence agencies did fultz say that oleary say she did not seem very interested in the matter why according to the washington times did a former contractor for one of the department of energys three nuclear weapons laboratories recall that oleary quote decided in her infinite wisdom to lessen security at the labs nuclear technology is being stolen and she lessened security at the labs the cold war is over the contractor says that she indicated and in mrs olearys mind it was not necessary to have so much money spent on security we did away with the people in actual security guard forces security clearances were deemed virtually unnecessary in all but a very few areas former secure areas were opened up and many documents and files were allowed to be seen which at one time were of a secret or classified nature why according to the washington times did the white house originally tell the cox committee that the president was not told about chinese espionage until 1998 we know he must have knownback as far as 1997 or 1996 when his nsc director sandy berger found out about it why did david leavy spokesman for the national security council explain this discrepancy by saying well after the cox committee process weve remembered more on april 7 1998 speaking at a unitedstates institute for peace event president clinton implied that anyone critical of china was using quote caricatures and exaggerating the chinese threat let me share a portion of the presidents speech according to the record now we hear that china is a country to be feared a growing number of people say that it is the next great threat to our security and our wellbeing they claim it is building up its military machine for aggression and using the profits of our trade to pay for it they urge us therefore to contain china to deny it access to our markets our technology our investment and to bolster the strength of our allies in asia to counter the threat a strong china will pose in the 21st century what about that scenario clearly if it chooses to do so china could pursue such a course pouring much more of its wealth into military might and into traditional great power geopolitics this would rob it of much of its future prosperity and it is far from inevitable that china will choose this path therefore i would argue that we should not make it more likely that china choose this path by acting as if that decision has already been made we have to follow a different course we cannot afford caricatures well the president knew that they had been stealing nuclear secrets from our laboratories our nuclear laboratories neutron bomb technology w88 technology mrving technology for warheads and it had been given to them by a person who worked for the laboratory the president had to know this as far back as early 1997 and yet they kept the man on there for over 2 more years and the president said we do not need to worry about that why is china taking this additional nuclear technology if they do not really need it if they do not have any intentions of using it just a couple of years ago they fired some missiles into the sea of china next to taiwan one of the leading military people in china said that he did not think the united states would worry too much about that because if we got involved we would be much more concerned about los angeles than we would about taiwan the implication was that there might be a threat that they would do something like launching a missile at los angeles if we stuck our nose into the taiwanese issue on march 29 1999 one week before president clintons press conference with chinese prime minister zhu newsweek reported that when the cia recently showed data obtained from its sources on china to a team of nuclear weapons experts they practically fainted these are our nuclear weapons experts and when the cia recently showed that data that was obtained from its sources about chinas stealing of that technology our nuclear weapons guys almost fainted the data much of it written in chinese and never read had been stored in cia computers and forgotten until now it showed that chinese scientists were routinely using phrases descriptions and concepts that came straight out of unitedstates weapons laboratories like los alamos the chinese penetration is total said one official close to the investigation they are deep deep into the labs black programs and black programs are our most sensitive nuclear technology security issues and they are deep deep

asked the bank of china to provide us with bank records that would show the origins of millions of dollars in foreign money that was funneled into the presidents reelection committee and the democrat national committee the bank of china has turned us down flat the clinton administration has refused to do anything to help us get this important information when so many people take the fifth amendment or flee the country it is obvious that a lot of laws have been broken the clinton administration failure to investigate chinas funneling of illegal contributions into the clintongore

irreparable damage to americas national security it has compromised the security of every man woman and child in this country this has to be investigated the american public has a right to know what is going on regarding these illegal campaign contributions and the thefts of our nuclear technology and whether or not there is any connection between the two we can no longer accept the compromise of

but particularly on the issue of the patients bill of rights and managed care reform the gentlewoman mentioned some of the piecemeal approaches that we are hearing from the republican leadership and i just wanted to remind my colleagues and maybe we could just spend a few minutes explaining why we are here tonight essentially the problem that we face as democrats is that the republican majority in the house has been unwilling to bring up the patients bill of rights and since we do not control the procedure either in committee or on the floor of the house we are forced essentially just to speak out and explain why it is unfair that the patients bill of rights has not been brought up here in the house of representatives obviously what we have tried to do from the beginning of this year is to have a hearing on the bill in committee which has not been allowed and then to mark it up and bring it to the floor when none of that was possible for the last 6 months we then se h5357 tried the discharge petition process where we come down to the floor and sign a petition the way our constituents petition us and basically the way the rules provide that if a majority of us sign a petition that the bill comes to the floor the patients bill of rights would come to the floor without going to committee that is of course difficult too because we have to get a majority and i believe because of the delegate status of the gentlewoman from the virgin islands she is not even allowed to sign the petition or maybe she can sign it but it does not mean anything that she signs it which i think is also unfortunate and should be changed but now that we have gotten a significant number of members to sign the petition i know we had over 180 before the july 4th break we are starting to see the republican leadership get a little restless and come up with other ideas about how to avoid a debate on this issue one of the things they did was to bring up a series of piecemeal bills that took little pieces of the patient protections that we have in the patients bill of rights and basically brought them up in committee and tried to get them out of committee fortunately there were a few i think two or three republicans who did not want to go along with that because as the gentlewoman said they wanted a comprehensive approach like the patients bill of rights so that has gotten bogged down i am not sure what the latest tactics are to deal with that piecemeal approach we do have some republicans that are joining us in the effort and feel that this really should be a bipartisan issue but unfortunately it has not been because the republican leadership continues to not allow the patients bill of rights to be brought up i just wanted if i could to again say that the problem with these piecemeal bills is essentially what i talked about before with the gentlewoman from california which is the two key points the fact that doctors and patients should make decisions about what kind of treatment or care they get and not the insurance company is absent in those piecemeal bills and of course there is no real enforcement there is no real opportunity to go outside the hmo to make an appeal there is no opportunity to sue in a court of law if someone is seriously damaged so i think it is important that we keep raising this issue and even though we do have the other body now bringing up the issue of hmo reform it is not at all clear whether or not we are going to really see action on the patients bill of rights so we will have to wait and see what develops in that

mayor had turned down a state dinner at the white house because of his wifes bowling engagement it would have been a serious breach of etiquette to ralph perk and the city of cleveland it is a badge of honor mayor perk served as mayor from 1972 to 1977 at a time when the city was developing some financial difficulties but ralph perk was able to work with the federal government and the nixon white

off the bonds of the financially strapped cleveland transit authority to create what is now the greater cleveland regional transit authority although it has been more than 20 years since ralph perk

colorado for yielding me time and i appreciate his giving me the opportunity tonight to be able to make some comments of my own on such an important subject but first i want to thank him for his giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher taxes and require fewer social services than less skilled immigrants the national academy of sciences states that over his or her lifetime each immigrant with less than a high school education will cost american taxpayers 89 000 that is the government benefits consumed by each immigrant will exceed taxes they paid by 89 000 to citizens concerned about how we are to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security in the next century these numbers should set off alarms more than 300 000 immigrant workers with less than a high school education entering our country this year will require 27 billion more in government services and benefits than they will contribute in taxes that is 27 billion for example that will not be available to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security and medicare next year another 300 000plus immigrants will enter the country with less than a high school education over their lifetimes they will claim another 27 billion that could provide education and training to recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens who have less than a high school education and who are disadvantaged in our economy common sense tells us that we should align our immigration policy with the needs of america the economy is crying out for more educated workers and one of the easiest and most costfree ways of providing these workers is through immigration reform doing so would mean more economic opportunity for all americans now i am

have to bite the bullet on social security and phase it out over time this is the house majority leader dick armey what my friend from north dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe the concept of the socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice i dont know of an insurance company that would offer a drugonly policy like that or even consider it mr president i say to my friend from north dakota we know there needs to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering suicide if they are to take one pill a day they are splitting them in two they are asking if they can get half a prescription filled

senate bill that is absolutely not worth the paper it is written on now that is a tall order but we are told by the gentleman from california thatthis is our effortto tilt the relationship between the house and the senate and we are told by the gentlemanfrom oklahoma this is a political ploy well i will say what this really is this is about rumors floating aroand from a conference that will not even allow the authors on the republicanside to be on the conference that is what this is al about this is about a conference that is going to put everybody on the conference from the republican side who voted against the bill now i think we might ought to be concerned about what is going to happen in conference when we send everybody in there who voted against the bill that is whatowe call tilting the relationship between the house and the senate and that is what we call a political ploy i want to thank my friend the gentleman fromt michigan on the other side of the aisle for flaving considered me for one of the seats on the conference committee since my own party as yet has not offered me a seat i am grateful i humbly declined as i believe my outspokenness against my own partys position in this matter might become the issue and the committee does not need any distractions from the real issues before us and that is protecting patients therefore as i remain free to continue my outspokenness i implore my leaders to be aware of the political reality as they seek a final course of action on this issue they have for the last 5 years opposed patient protections and publicly allied themselves in joint news conferences with hmo lobbyists under public pressure we forced a vote on october 7 they have even refused to allow a single subcommittee vote on this legislation this in spite of the support by the majority of the house and a third of the republican caucus the majority of patients in this country support it the majority of doctors the majority of hospitals even the majority of employers i feel these same opponents believe they can now subvert the conference committee to produce a report repugnant to the original legislation in order to force the house of representatives to really reject the final report these opponents believe a multimillion dollar public relations campaign can shift that blame to the other party i say today that the fate of the next election is in the balance and that plan will fail because of their past actions and affiliations our party has no credibility on hmo reform all the clever commercials that money can buy will not change that fact but that fact can and should change if our conferees act withcourageto enforce the willof this house thatis whartthi motion is all about go into the conference and fight for the position of this house itis in perfeet concert with thewwill of the american people i urge my colleagues to support these instructions to insist on full uneticumbered legal accountability for hmos trueexternal appeals and the protections of all americans all americans with health insurance not just the few who need this the least i want both republicanand democratic patients to win to

a modest increase in funding for the nea and the neh most of us could probably dust off last years statement and just use that again because the issues have not changed they are the same every year every year supporters of the national endowment for the arts come to the floor and we present overwhelming evidence that the nea is a good investment for our country we talk about the broad geographic reach of the nea with grants to all 50 state arts agencies as well as to the hundreds of communities across the country we talk about how the nea has extended the reach of the arts into rural communities to which the arts never reached before all across the country we talk about the importance of nea seed money in leveraging private support like the 4 million in total funding chamber music america was able to raise from just a 300 000 nea grant we talk about the economic benefits of the nea pointing to the tens of billions of dollars in economic activity generated the millions of jobs supported and the billions of dollars in federal income tax generated by the arts every year and we talk about the numerous educational projects supported by the nea from programs for young children to lifelong learners finally we talk about the inherent value of supporting a vibrant arts community in this nation how the arts lift the spirits of our citizens and bring us together how they entertain us and make us think how they leave a lasting legacy for our children and their children to remember and celebrate but as i said we bring up these arguments year after year of course a few years ago we were debating whether the nea should even exist whether it was the proper role of government to subsidize the arts but we have won that fight clearly the american people support the nea and the work it does clearly the american people believe the federal government also has a role in promoting the arts and cultivating artists throughout the country but in order to carry out this mandate we must fund the nea at a level that enables it to fulfill its mission today resources are stretched too thin to adequately fund worthy projects the average grant size has dropped by over half

not necessary if the highpaid ceo is going to receive a big tax break for health care then should the cleaning lady not that makes minimum wage nowadays democrats seem more eager to pile new mandates

base resolution as well as the gejdenson amendment and in opposition to the fowler amendment our debate today and this evening centers on one of the most serious and fundamental responsibilities that we hold as elected representatives of a free and open democracy the recommendation to commit our military forces to a hostile or potentially hostile environment i respect the fact that we as members of this body should debate this issue fully i am however concerned that the timing of this debate is suspect and in fact is very dangerous and can undermine the peace process that the administration has been engaged in in the balkan region for some time former senate majority leader bob dole who recently returned from the peace negotiations in the kosovo region testified yesterday that congress should wait to debate the deployment of american troops there until an agreement between the parties in the region has first in fact been reached in fact secretary of state madeleine albright has said the same exact thing delicate negotiations continue to take place in europe even as we debate this today there is a plan to have the sides meet in 1 week to try to work out an agreement and over the last few days hopes have been raised that such an agreement may be possible even as heavy weapons pour into the area and shelling wracks the countryside i would hope that this body would give those negotiators every opportunity to develop a working peace plan i am concerned our actions may instead give the impression to warmongers in former yugoslavia that american leadership is divided and its resolve is weak such an impression i am afraid will only encourage fanatical opportunists to continue their violence and terrorize the innocent noncombatant residents of kosovo i hope our debate today is truly based as has been stated numerous times today on the desire to have an open discussion of american foreign policy it has been said in the past that politics should stop at waters edge and i would hope that in the context of this debate that that statement is more true today than even in the past during my first term in office in fact last spring i had the honor to go over to bosnia and to visit our troops and the military leaders and even the residents of a war torn region i wish every american in this country had the opportunity to go over there and experience the pride that i felt in meeting with the young men and women in american uniforms who are carrying out a very dangerous and a very difficult policy in a distant land they are proud of their work and show great professionalism and integrity they are committed to carrying out the tasks that we have asked them to with honor and pride in fact the killing has stopped and peace does have a chance now democratic institutions are being created when just a few short years ago there were genocidal practices being conducted in bosnia they feel like their mission means something they have stopped the killing they are instructing young children who just a few years ago were playing in mine fields and getting maimed by the explosion of mines where it is safe for them to play it is an incredible testament to the leadership the united states has shown in this war torn region i would hope that we view the success that we have attained so far in bosnia as a possibility to achieve that type of success in the entire balkan region including kosovo i support our troops serving this nations interests throughout the world and i support the peace process in kosovo if needed i will support a wellplanned use of troops to assist in maintaining the peace in that region that has been the spark of continental and worldwide conflict in the notsodistant past it is in the nations interest to work with our european allies to prevent the kosovo region from destabilizing and drawing the balkan region into further armed conflict but i submit that the debate we are having today is premature i would like to first see a detailed plan and objective goals that the administration establishes in that region before we introduce unitedstates men and women in unitedstates uniforms in that region so we know when we can withdraw them again from that region such a conflict that now exists there poses a humanitarian threat to innocent civilians and a political threat to the struggling independent nations emerging from the cold war the united states will be impacted by all these threats and preventive action is the best way to protect our interests there the reality is that our nation holds a unique position in worldwide affairs whether we like it or not most major peace accords in recent years have required a deeply involved american presence and american negotiators at the table just a few weeks ago forces in kosovo indicated that international peacekeeping efforts will have little credibility unless the united states is intimately involved in carrying out that mission when the international community
