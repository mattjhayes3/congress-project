eloquently has given us there should be no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee and in so doing want to take this opportunity to commend him and my colleagues for a splendid job under the most distressing and painful circumstances imaginable i yield back to the distinguished gentleman"], [9.894371032714844e-06,

president proposed and those who would hurt the little people of this nation would propose here today and in the few days to come i rise to address the energy function of the congressional black caucus budget this function includes the department of energy programs including research and development of new energy sources energy conservation and preparedness civilian and defense nuclear programs and rural electrification projects the congressional black caucus alternative rejects the premise that energy policy can adequately be addressed on the local level since energy is a nati nal concern the congressional bla k caucus budget retains the department of energy the doe was created to allow for a comprehensive national energy policy on energy production and supply problems as well as on international energy issues in addition the doe amasses data on energy and coordinates and funds energy research and development the dismantling of doe would result in a disunifled response to energy concerns and a disparate application of energy policy despite the vast amount of discussion which has been heard on the issue of dismantlement of doe there has been no clear showing that significant savings will accrue from dismantlement most of the department of energys functions would be scattered among the departments of commerce interior and justice another deleterious result of the threatened dismantlement of doe has been the loss of expertise due to job shifts and reductions in force because of these losses of the past and those to come the requisite skil d persons who could run many of the er ergy programs targeted for transfer are not available to the chosen departments one other program which the congressional black caucus particularly favors for continued funding is the does office of minority economic impact the administration has zero funded this program despite the fact that its funds have already been authorized the office of minority economic impact has research programs at black colleges a minority bank development program a minority business loan program and an engineering college program to name a few of its projects in addition to these activities omei has performed the task of monitoring the impact of energy programs and policies on minorities and making policy recommendations to the secretary of energy the congressional black caucus supports refunding of omei in the amount of 1 635 million a phenomenal but little known fact about this administrations energy budget is that a ful 88 percent is dedicated to nuclear programs this leaves only 12 percent for programs such as fossil research solar and conservation programs the congressional black caucus has provided some relief to the disparity in the use of the taxpayers dollar specifically the civilian nuclear programs have increased since 1981 by 98 million the atomic energy defense activity funding has increased by 1 84 billion during that period since these programs were not subjected to the severe reductions imposed on other vital programs the cbc had redistributed 20 percent of the proposed reagan increases in the atomic energy and nuclear fission programs to other energy projects the cbc again goes on record as we did last year opposing the clinch river breeder reactor deleting 253 million in funding for this project although core programs will be maintained despite these reductions the benefit of the cbcs funding allocations will be to allow vital programs which were targeted for elimination to continue energy conservation solar and renewable energy programs have been decimated over the past 2 fiscal years by the budget reductions energy conservation was reduced from a 1981 funding level of 712 million to the current administrations proposed authorization for 1983 of 21 million solar and renewable energy programs were reduced from a 1981 authorization of 500 million to the current administrations 72 million for 1983 this is a trend which cannot continue the result of the budget cuts in these areas is a rejection of the need to use energy in an efficient manner the result of cuts in these areas is the elimination of state emergency plan ning funds lowincome weatherization programs energy efficiency research programs schools and hospitals pro grams minimum energy performance standards for new appliances among others these are effective programs for example under the home weatherization program homes weatherized jumped from 96 355 in 1978 to 291 ooc in 1981 the energy savings were 23 4 percent and all initial expenditure were recouped in energy saving within 4 years the matching funds given foi energy efficiency investments ir schools and hospitals and local govern ment buildings is part of another pro gram which showed great success par ticularly in light of the fact that thes buildings rank among the top ir energy consumption the investmeni in energy efficient equipment anc practices led to the federal share cosi saved for 1 barrel of oil equivalent ir public institutions to be estimated al 2 28 compared to 34 for a barrel oi oil on the market the savings wa 4 31 for hospitals and 11 20 fo1 schools another very significant program o energy conservation is the researcd and development of energy conserva tion measures in conjunction with u a industry more sophisticated cogenera tion systems recovery of waste heat systems of computer control and com bustion efficiencyall were program where costs were shared between in dustry and the federal government for the purpose of finding a more effi clent use of energy foreign industries have becomi more energy efficient than the u s counterparts foreign government give economic support to energy effl clency

inability to compet and subsequent reductions in labo forces for example the japanese use one half the amount of energy in makin steel than american industries us not long ago in our energy committee the concern was repeatedly raised tha the alaskan pipeline being built by combined effort of many america companies may not be made with u e steel but rather with foreign steel be cause of the price

that the federt government abandoned state pr grams have been estimated to say 192 1 trillion btus with a lifetim dollar savings of 13 billion it has cost 217 million to run those offices that amount is 196 million more than the entire energy conservation budget under reagan in 1981 50 percent of the state energy offices relied on 80 percent or more federal dollars indubitably the extreme cuts to the energy conservation budget will mean the closing of these offices or at least severe paring down and ultimately the loss of these energy and dollar savings the inefficiency of these administrations budget cuts is shown again the congressional black caucus tries to do something about these budget cuts by offering an alternative to the reagan budget by offering a more balanced budget in terms of the division of funds among the various programs in my opinion the challenge and the goal of government is to strike the happy median whereby all facets of our national community are served the pendulum of government during times on economic distress should not swing so lopsidedly that those who only have a weak grasp on the american ladder of success are flung aside we of the congressional black caucus daily rededicate our efforts to attaining that governmental equilibrium we urge you to join us in that effort"], [1.7404556274414062e-05, 0.9999825954437256, 1, "let me first of all pay tribute to the chairman of the committee on the budget the gentleman from oklahoma for really having done a brilliant job in putting together the resolution which was reported out of our committee and which is under consideration today i think it is very important at this stage of the debate to be very clear as to exactly what the differences are between the two resolutions we are about to vote on if we eliminate tile differences between them which are due to differing economic assumptions it is quite clear that both the grammlatta substitute and thle house budget committee resoluition~ call for roughly the same level or federal spending in the next fiscal year and both of them therefore require roughly the same lcvel of reductions in federal spending the issue therefore is not whether to cut federal spending or for that matter even by how much to cut federal spending but where to cut the federal budget and how to cut the federal budget it seems to me that when we look at it in that respect it is very clear that the resolution reported out by the budget committee is infinitely more desirable by adding to defense interest and the socalled safety net programs thle grammlatta substitute decreases the allother categories of the budget from 28 1 percent of the total in 1981 to 17 9 percent in 1984 as the house budget committee resolution makes clear it is possible to cut the budget more equitably than the administration has done reagan is using budget cutting as an excuse for an attack on social programs cuts in afdc food stamps and medicaid will reduce the spendable income of over 7 5 million poor and working poor families at a time of high inflation and high unemnployment the proposed cap on medicaid will place an intolerable burden on states and localities and will inevitably result in service cutbacks the house budget committee restores 700 million and rejects the cap the proposed education block giantsi will cut 1 5 billion or 25 percent irn fiscal year 1982 the administration claims that increased efficiencies will result in the same level of service to our schoolchildren when administrative costs average 4 percent it is more realistic to assume savings on the order oi 1 or 2 percent rather than 25 percent the school districts which will suffer from these cuts will be those with the largest enrollments of lowincome students the budget committee restores 900 million or 15 percent of these education cuts the administration proposes 700 million in afdc cuts that eliminate the work incentive this cut is shortsighted and bad social policy the budget committee restores 500 million and preserves the work incentive the administration cuts 2 3 billion in child nutrition programs which will force many schools to elin~inate their school lunch and nutrition education programs altogether the budget committee restores 1 1 billion of these cuts and fully funds the wic program for mothers and infant cliiidren at a time when rental housing in urban areas is in short supply and rents rising the administration proposes to reduce subsidized housing from 250 000 units to 175 000 units the committee resolution funds a level of 250 000 units while we are still dependent on foreign energy supplies the administration proposes to rely on the inequitous technique of energy conservation through price grammlatta proposes to cut 1 billion from conservation and solar programs the committee restores 350 million for these programs qrammlatta suggests a cut of 25 percent in lowincome energy assistance the committee restores 400 million or 80 percent of these cuts finally grammlatta assumes that the strategic petroleum reserve can be entirely funded through the sale of bonds it is bad policy to rely totally on untested schemes in so important an area as quickly filling spro the committee provides for partial financing with government backup with the administration cuts we mortgage our future the latta proposal guts the guaranteed student loan and pell grant programs at a time when we must educate young people to be more productive in a world where our ability to compete is eroding the committee restores 650 million for these programs grammlatta guts ceta training at a time when minority youth unemployment is between 40 and 50 percent we will create a permanent underclass with this kind of proposal the committee restores 600 million for training grammlatta mainly assumes that the private sector will provide capital resources for highways railroads mass transit longterm scientific research and development and support for the arts and humanities it assumes the private bar will provide legal services for the poor the reason the federal government is involved in these activities is because the private sector cannot or will not afford them in all of these areas the committee assumes that there must be a federal presence equally bad is that grammlatta assumes the kemproth tax cut its obvious inequities aside kemproth is inflationary we need no more proof that the recent rise in interest rates which the administration is now blaming on the federal reserve the committee tax cut is smaller and more oriented to productivity than consumption when the economy declines further the administration will find another scapegoat in the end the american people will put the blame where it belongson poorly conceived and poorly implemented shortsighted reagan policies the real issue is whether we attempt to cut the budget on the backs of the poor the elderly the hungry the unemployed the deprived and the disabled or whether we move in a more equitable and compassionate manner as the committee budget resolution does i urge my colleagues to reject the republican

possible impact of the reagan budget proposals on all segments of the public in their pure form the administrations plans benefit those already rich hurt the poor and cast the middle classthe bedrock of our community adrift on inflationary seas there are serious problems with the presidents proposalsespecially the kemproth income tax cutswhich i believe could greatly worsen our pres ent inflation peter g peterson chairman of lehman bros kuhn loeb and secretary of commerce in the nixon administration impeccably republican warns that the administrations suggested tax cuts lean too much toward consumption too little toward the reinvestment we urgently need he cautioned that if even a few of the presidents assumptions are wrong we could be headed toward the largest budget deficit in our history next year henry kaufman the highly respected chief economist at salomon bros of wall street said the administrations overall program is exceedingly expansionary and does not fight inflation he said that under the pressure of kemproths 10percentayearfor3years income tax cuts interest rates easily could break the 21percent record reached last year this would cripple economic recovery when the general outline of the presidents economic package emerged earlier the prestigious investment firm of kidder peabody co noted the nations financial community must now look to house democrats to significantly modify the reagan program to maintain fiscal responsibility 0 what has happened is that some ideological radicals have gained ascendancy in parts of the new administration in the guise of budget cutting they propose to experiment with their untried pet theories using the economy of the entire united states as a guinea pig it is as kidder peabody suggested the responsibility of congress and especially the democratic majority in the house to act as loyal opposition and resist such potentially destabilizing economic experiments i supported on the house floor tax cuts which will spur investment create new jobs and improve the productivity of the american economy these tax cuts include accelerated depreciation schedules for business improved exemptions from income taxes for interest earned in savings accounts and modifications of the capital gains taxes but kemproth acrosstheboard cuts are an umproven elixir patent medicine tax breaks which favor the superrich over the middleincome people who are the backbone of our society vice president bush himself described president reagans proposals as voodoo economics i favor the general size of the reductions advanced by the president the proposal offered by house budget committee chairman jim jones agrees with the president in three out of four cases but it disagrees in some important areas the president wants to reduce significantly federal support for primary and secondary education for job training for nutrition for children and medical care for the elderly the truly needy will become truly needierand unnecessarily so he also proposes the elimination of the economic development administration an agency which has helped support redevelopment in downtown columbus and thereby economic growth in all of central ohio many of the administrations proposed reductions simply areas i saidnot necessary to curb the growth of the federal budget and controlling inflation in contrast the administration throws away hundreds of millions of dollars on the obsolete clinch river breeder reactor tobacco subsidies and traditional pork barrel water projects also worthy of noting is the refusal of the administration to close any of the notorious tax loopholes which could save more than enough to offset some of the unnecessary cuts which hurt the elderly sick and poor so badly the defense budget remains basically the same under the jones and hefner proposals as under the presidents expanded military spending vital to our national security can be maintained safely only by tax cuts prudently applied so as to arrest renewed inflationary pressures i campaigned for a balanced budget and for action to curb inflation the problem with the kemproth proposal for those of us who believe in prudent economics is this kemproths sweeping 3year tax cuts are not offset by matching budget cuts walter heller former chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers recently recommended that further personal tax cuts should be put in place only after they have been earned by further budget cuts and or clear evidence of reduced inflation that would be the path of fiscal prudence the too likely result of the kemproth as now proposed will be bigger and bigger deficits and more inflationthe very things i campaigned against we are not arguing that the economy does not need a catalyst for increased investment job creation and productivity increases but as with allpowerful medicine timing and dosage are crucial first let us cut the budget and reduce the federal deficit this will have the effect of lowering interest rates spurring productive investment and strengthening the economy in general specific tax cuts focused where they can benefit the economy without adding to inflation should be made as suggested above tax revenue then would rise and personal income taxes could be cut significantly without inflationary results i realize it might be easier politically to join in the emotional climate of the moment and approve the presidents package without question but the possible dangers for the economy are too great for any of us who believe in prudent economics to suspend judgment as a businessman a lawyer and most importantly as representative of a middleamerican district i am interested in economic growth and stability in curtailing both inflation and the expansion of the federal government i think the position outlined by chairman jonessupporting many of tile presidents proposed cuts modifying others and calling for more realistic tax reductionswill do just

director of the mint for this reason i would like to direct your attention to a message i have received from another former mint director eva adams president kennedy appointed ms adams as director of the mint in 1961 at the completion of her first 5year term president johnson reappointed her to a second term which she served until august 1969 during her tenure at the mint ms adams launched a successful program to alleviate a nationwide coin shortage and supervised the construction of the new mint in philadelphia through her position on the joint commission on the coinage eva adams was frequently called upon to make recommendations to the president the congress and the secretary of the treasury on coinage and related problems ms adams oversaw the change from silver to clad coinage in 1965 she has received a number of awards for her outstanding work as mint director including the treasury departments exceptional service award in light of this considerable experience ms adams c9mments on the two olympic commemorative coin proposals now before congress are particularly noteworthy in her letter she endorses my bill h r 3879 which calls for a single silver dollar to be sold directly to the public by the mint the former director opposes the other proposal contained in s 1230 and h r 3958 which calls for the minting of numerous coins to be sold through private marketers ms adams objections to this legislation as outlined in her letter are very similar to those i have previously raised s 1230 and h r 3958 call for the minting of 25 different coins i have repeatedly stated my opposition to this provision multiple issues are confusing and discouraging to the buying public and the cost of owning a complete set of coins under this bill would be prohibitive as a result i fear that these coins will not sell ahd that the entire program will end in failure ms adams shares these concerns and worries that this unnecessarily elaborate program would place an unfair burden on the mints facilities as the mint has already been ordered to reduce its budget by 16 percent since the administration suggests that we all do more with less i wonder why s 1230 and h r 3958 suggest that we do less with more ms adams also opposes the private marketing of official unitedstates commemorative coins i believe that this provision will contribute to the high costs consumers will be forced to pay should this program get underway in addition i have frequently questioned the propriety of allowing the consortium of lazardfreres an international investment firm occidental petroleum and the franklin mint to market these coins it is not clear why this contract was made without the benefit of the competitive bidding process and as ms adams reminds us in her letter it was the private marketing of coins that led to the termination of commemorative coinage in 1954 both eva adams and i agree that the 1984 summer olympics should be marked by the minting of a commemorative coin americas olympic athletes have certainly earned our respect and they deserve our financial support however we would like to approve a sensible program to celebrate this event and raise money for our athletes the proposal set forth in s 1230 and h r 3958 is not the best way to achieve these goals i contend that the plan outlined in my bill h r 3879 is a much more realistic proposition former

pleasure to be speaking this evening about an hour and 10 minutes before the president of the united states will address the country on the issue of tax cuts and turning the american economy around the president i anm certain will explain to us that he is concerned with economy recovery with creating jobs with fighting inflation and with developing what once upon a time was called prosperity and that he has a tax bill the conablehance bill which president reagan supports which is essentially an economic bill designed to develop more jobs to allow people to have more real takehome pay and to fit into a general economy recovery plan i am very pleased this evening to be able to put into the record the statement of the honorable normal b ture the under secretary of treasury for tax and economic affairs which was made this morning before the republican house task force on economic policy dr ture is an expert on taxes and economics he is one of the foiunders of the supplyside school of economics and i think if i may quote from his statements which i will insert at the end of my special order that he as much as anybody has drawn the lines between the rostenkowskioneiul tax bill and president reagans efforts on a bipartisan basis with mr conable and mr hance to develop a genuine economic recovery tax bill dr ture points out and i quote the conabiehance bill has been designed to provide families at all income levels with meaningful and permanent tax relief it is the only bill now being offered which does this he continues dr ture continues the presidents tax program is the only plan which will provide real longterm tax relief for the american people be~ause it includes indexing the conablehance tax cut will not be repealed by bracket creep and inflation the president and members of congress of both parties who support the bipartisan bill are making this pledge we will get your tax rates down we will keep your tax rates down there will be no hidden tax increases there will be no ifs ands or buts about it in other words the reagan tax program is clear it is long term it is permanent and is a genuine tax cut dr ture goes on then to explain the alternative and i quote by contrast the~ ways and means bill is a temporary 2year 15percent tax cut which turns into a tax increase in 1984 it is not even large enough to offset builtin tax increases of about 22 percent due to bracket creep and higher payroll tax between now and 1984 the ways and means bill is not a real tax cut at all unless you only plan to live for two more years i mentioned earlier today in a iminute speech the distinction that president reagan has drawn as the reason we were wearing the button that says i plan to live president reagans tax cut is a real tax cut for your illetime it genuinely changes the tax code permanently on the other hand the rostenkowskioneill tax bill is a shortterm gimmick designed to buy time and then after time taxes go back up the difference is immense in the long run in fact as dr ture points out the oneillrostenkowski bill actually increases the steepness of bracket creep it actually means that if you get pay raises in the future the jump will be higher and steeper the way he puts it and i quote the ways and means bill has a shock in store for middle bracket taxpayers some of the biggest steptips in tax rates from one tax bracket to the next ever to appear in the tax code middleincome taxpayers filing joint returns would find themselves leaping through brackets in which they pay 25 percent 34 percent 41 percent and 48 percent of additional income to the government stepups of 9 7 and 7 percentage points in taxable incomes of 30 300 and 46 200 in other words after 2 brief years of delay under the rostenkowskioneill bill suddenly you start leapfrogging into higher and higher brackets dr ture compares the rostenkowskioneill tax increases with the world war ii surcharges frankly since i was born in 1943 this is history to me but i think it is relevant hlitory for everyone who lived through it and it is relevant history for everyone who wants to learn from it in world war ii faced with this nations greatest crisis we had a tax surcharge which carried taxpayers from 22 percent to 47 percent with six steps in between they did it over a span that was almost three times as wide as the span in the rostenkowskonetu bill in order words without a war in peacetime the rostenkowskioneill bill is going to leapfrog us higher and higher at a very rapid rate it is in effect a bill which encourages you to get a pay cut rather than a pay raise dr ture concludes and i quote this is a clear demonstration of the cynical intent of the ways and means bill to give a tax cut next year while rigging the tax code to take it all back at record rates just as quickly as possible nothing could be plainer the committees bill provides the form not the substance of incentive tax reduction i am inserting dr tures testimony i believe that every american who is concerend about the decay of our economy about high interest rates about high unemployment every american who wants to see us go back to an economy to become again a country in which you can work and save and which you can get a pay raise and keep the raise every american should read what dr ture says tonight president reagan will address us on wednesday this house will decide we do have an opportunity to genuinely change history in the next few days a tax gimmick or a genuine tax cut more decay or return to real jobs and real opportunity the choice is ours the

franklin roosevelt spent 82 7 million john kennedy spent 210 5 million and jimmy carter spent 1 3 billion it took 186 years to raise the annual federal spending to a level of 100 billion it then took only 9 more years to double that figure to 200 billion four yeexs later federal spending reached 300 billion and in just 2 more years it reached the 400 billion mark federal outlays exceeded 500 billion in fiscal year 1980 600 billion in fiscal year 1981 and are projected to exceed 700 billion in fiscal year 1982 if this is not enough to convince the members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment the very fact that the amount of federal spending per average household increased 46 percent during the 4 years of the carter administrationfrom 5 026 in fiscal year 1976 to 7 329 in fiscal 1980 is alarming and not acceptable to the

political disadvantages the political costs of excessive spending are deferred resulting in high inflation huge deficits and higher taxes while the political benefits of the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congessmen who support it a similar process and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely noticeable but when the costs of all the programs are added the impact is severe the requirements of balancing the budget and limiting the growth in spending will give the taxpayers an qual opportunity to influence spending discussions through the ballot box under the balancedbudget amendment congressmen will be forced to remain aware of public opinion because the votes for deficit spending and tax increases will be voted directly on those issues this should result in an examination of priorities when programs are considered the spending limitation will force congress to make choices which should lead to more efficient government the american people are demanding that congress balance the budget today we have the opportunity to carry out the will of the people and this is one congressman who will be voting to support the people of this country it is clear that the american budget process is seriously deficient it is also apparent that the public is concerned about federal spending and is willing to use the constitutional means to change the system in a september 1981 gallup poll 67 percent of those surveyed favored a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and restrict spending only 19 percent were opposed this support cut across traditional political lines the ultimate question then is not whether a constitutional amendment should 1 t ed but whether this is the best one possible house joint resolution 350 possesses economic and political virtues vital to the health of the american system the elimination or sharp reduction in deficit spending and the limitation on spending will reduce inflationary monetary policies and allocate more financial resources to the private sector the provisions that would

housing starts are the lowest in recent memory unemployment in the construction trades and bankruptcies in housing related firms are rampant this depression in one of our most basic industriesan industry which provides americans with one of their most important cherished and traditional dreamshas been greeted by the reagan administration with callous disregard more than 6 months ago i questioned reagan administration officials on how they were going to deal with the impending crisis in housing the reagan response has been to establish a presidential commission to study the problem the blue ribbon study commission has produced a lot of rhetoric few new ideas but perhaps its most important characteristic is to provide a political shield to take the heat the reagan administration has done much more to the housing industry than just create a study commission first they eliminated 120 000 assisted housing units from the budget and they sought to further restrict the federal programs which direct capital toward housing then they rammed through a tax bill which has the effect of skewing investment incentives away from housing that same reagan supply side tax bill will be a principal contributor to the third ill that affects the housing industry high interest rates reaganomics increased capital intensive defense spending and the february 1981 presidentially mandated tight monetary policy combined with the added steam of the business tax cut which forces corporate borrowing and therefore increases pressure on money market has kept interest rates at unprecedented levels and will likely result in continued inflation during the last few weeks we have heard the incredible boasting by our colleagues from the other side of the aisle about the drop in the prime rate let me point out to my colleagues who are boasting of this progress that to achieve this drop america has entered a very serious recession and added millions of workers to the unemployment rolls in my judgment this is nothing to boast about it is important to note that the mortgage interest rate has not tracked the drop of the artificially high prime rate in the real world you would get little credit for achieving a drop in interest or inflation rates by creating a recession and increasing unemployment hi 8537 the real tragedy is that we need to build more than 20 million units of housing in the 1980s and at current rates we will build less than half that the real tragedy is that millions of americans who could build those homes are out of work the real tragedy is that millions of americans cannot hope to purchase a home a way of life that strengthens communities and families and provides stability for generations is going to disappear thle real tragedy is that there is a

even a minimal extcasion to 52 weeks i am especially concerned that during this coasting period the administration appears to be unaware of the disastrous effect its economic policies have on certain industries by its failure to come to the aid of the ailing housing industry for example the administration literally prevents whole crafts from contributing to our economy i would like to share with

economic proposals offered by the reagan administration i opposed its budget proposals for fiscal 1982 and 1983 because i feared that a combination of deficit spending and cutbacks in economic development programs and housing construction could lead to a stalled economy the reagan administration and i have a clear philosophical difference on how the government should be run while i do not expect the administration to relent on its basic supplyside approach to government i urge it to take three immediate steps to halt the devestation that is becoming the norm in certain sectors of the economy first the administration should drop its opposition to an extension of unemplpyment benefits we cannot relegate some people to the economic scrap heap while others fortunate enough to gain from the newly enacted tax breaks are living better than ever second the administration should bow to the will of the bipartisan majority of the congress and approve the 3 billion emergency housing assistance contained in the fiscal year 1982 supplemental appropriations bill this mortgage assistance will help bring life to the depressed housing industry by stimulating the construction of thousands of new homes third i ask the administration to join me in expressing strong opposition to the federal reserve boards tight money policies we cannot have economic recovery without the stimulative effect of lower interest rates for those in the construction industry the most important action the government could take would be to bring down the interest rate to 10 to 12 percent we cannot afford to coast much longer robert georgine president of the aflcio building trades department has made an astute observation on what can happen if we do as a result of this rampant lack of jobs many building tradesmen are laying down their tools and leaving the industry altogether the loss of such valuable human resources is irreparable when our nation finally faces up to its needs in housing mass transit and energy supply facilities where will we find the vast number of skilled workers to do the jobworkers and apprentices who are now being discouraged from work ing in the industry

and have consponsored a reso lution in the house of representatives which recognizes the contributions of the senior citizens who make up an everincreasing segmentof our society eighteen percent of pennsylvanias population is over 60 years of age thanks to better health care better housing better nutrition and better community services americans are living longer today than at any other time in our history these improvements in the quality of life for older americans were brought about to a large degree by the federal government previous administrations realized that the federal government along with society had a moral obligation to insure that the elderly could lead safe and productive lives these programs are indeed necessary since according to the 1980 census one out of six older americans lives on an income below the poverty level when president reagan outlined his program for economic recovery before a joint session of congress and the american people on february 18 1981 he stated we will continue to fulfill the obligations which spring from our national conscience those who through no fault of their own must depend on the rest of us the poverty stricken the disabled the elderly all of those with true need can rest assured that the social safety net of programs they depend on are exempt from any cuts what has happened to that promise only 4 months after president reagan made that pledge the administrationbacked omnibus reconciliation act was passed the effect of this legislation on senior citizens programs was severe food stamps were cut 16 percent social security and railroad civil service and military retirement were cut 20 percent medicare and medicaid were cut 10 percent sharp reductions planned for social security were shelved only after a massive protest by recipients however the administration was not content to make life harder for those to whom hardship was no stranger it set out to comfort the already comfortable through a tax bill which favors the wealthy the american people were assured by the administration that this program of reductions in funds for social programs and taxbreaks for the wealthy would pull the economy out of its slump and provide benefits for all americans where are we nearly 1 year after this program was enacted the jobless rate now stands at 9 4 percent nationwidethe highest rate since the great depression this figure represents an increase of 2 5 million people on the jobless roles since last july when the republican program was enacted instead of reevaluating a program that obviously is not working the administration is simply offering the american people more of the same in its budget proposals for fiscal year 1983 the sum of the new budget proposals would mean further misery particularly for the elderly poor let me cite a few examples of the impact of some of these proposals according to the congressional budget office 2 5 million elderly who now receive food stamps would lose their benefits altogether while another 66 percent would have their benefits reduced food stamp assistance would be considered as income when determining eligibility for housing assistance similarly energy assistance would be counted as income when determining eligibility for food stamps the cumulative effect of these three proposals alone would leave many lowincome elderly with a catch22 dilemma do they choose to eat stay warm or have adequate housing unfortunately the litany of hardships the admininstrations proposals if enacted would impose continues medicare would be cut by another 2 4 billion medicaid would be cut by an additional 1 9 bilion supplemental security income would be reduced 286 million in 1982 and 1 1 billion in 1987 programs which are funded under the older americans act would have their funding levels reduced from 986 million in 1982 to 652 1 million in 1983 the title v employment program would be abolished according to the national council on aging this would cause 80 000 lowincome elderly individuals to lose jobs which enable them to be independent as well as provide valuable community service apparently undaunted by massive public support for social security the administration appears ready to push for cuts in the program once again it supported a measure adopted by the senate budget committee which called for 40 billion in unspecified cuts in social security the administration prefers to leave pinpointing exactly where the reductions will be to a special commission which will make its report after the november election the message that has been coming through to me loud and clear from the senior citizens in my district is that they simply cannot sustain any further cutbacks in the programs on which they relysome for the basic necessities of lifefood shelter and health care this administration has not kept its promise to protect the social safety net of programs which benefit the needy and the elderly this pledge has apparently been lost in the enthusiasm for a stronger defense a stubborn commitment to an economic program that is not working and the need to lower the huge deficit brought about as a result of the administrations economic policies i too favor a strong national defense and a lowered deficit however these goals can be achieved in ways other than by making further cuts in needed social programs in my view an essential first step in lowering the deficit is to cancel the third year of the kemprothreagan tax cut the military budget also needs to be given as careful scrutiny as the social programs which have already borne their share of budget cuts we must restore the american peoples shaken faith in their government as a vehicle for social and economic justice we cannot abandon the elderly and

initiative in this house that was so boldly undertaken many months indeed years ago to get the bureaucracy of the federal government under control and to make it more responsible to the desires and wishes of the american people the reason i take this special order and begin this discussion is that for reasons which are unexplained to me and i think unexplainable the initia tives that have been launched in this direction have ground to a silent and mysterious halt someplace in the halls of this house what is regulatory reform all about mr speaker it is a method a means by which the american people seek to regain control over their own government the fact of the matter is that more decisions are made more rules and regulations are issued by unelected officials affecting the lives and the livelihood of all americans than there are as a result of laws passed by the congress of the united states during the average session of a congress somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 laws are passed during that same period of time almost 20 000 rules and regulations can be passed the ratio of those rules and regulations having the force and effect of law on nonelected officials as compared to those made by those elected by the people of the united states is something to contemplate much of the cynicism that the american people feel about their government is a result of the unaccountability of a bureaucracy that is remote insensitive arbitrary and sometimes yes oppressive it was out of this concern that members of congress both in the house and the other body rose up and said that we are going to change this in a bipartisan way members of my party democrats took the initiative in this effort originally to bring the bureaucracy under control through a streamlining and accountability even through the use of the legislative veto which lets members of the congress elected by accountable to the people have the final say so by reviewing and where necessary rejecting and vetoing regulations issued by unelected bureaucrats in 1975 when that issue of legislative veto first came to the floor of this house for a vote up or down on all agencies that should be covered by it 265 members of this house voted in favor if it since that time for reasons again unexplained and unexplainable there has never been an effort made to get that legislation back to this floor for action even though over a majority of the members of this house of both parties have cosponsored legislation to that effect we have amended pieces of legislation on an itembyitem basis to place this mechanism in effect to get control over these unaccountable bureaucrats and it has had an improving impact on our government recently we added this type of control over the federal trade commission different programs in the environmental protection agency and the department of agriculture but the need to make the entire bureaucracy accountable to the american people still remains in years gone past while the house of representatives has moved forward the other body has been reluctant the other body has been the one that has failed to pass this legislation but this year this year the other body by a unanimous vote adopted legislation providing for regulatory reform including a legislative veto what has happened in this house mr speaker what has happened i think is a shame because it reflects upon the members and the leadership of this house what has happened is that although regulatory reform legislation was reported out of the judiciary committee on february 25 of this year that legislationa major bipartisan effort to return control of the bureaucracy to the american peoplehas not yet been able to be voted on by the members of this house the legislative veto legislation h r 1976 which has over 250 cosponsors well over a majority of the members of this house of both parties has yet to be considered in committee or brought to the floor of this house i think it is regrettable that for reasons that cannot be explained there are those in power in this house who have been unwilling to let the voice of the american people be heard who have been unwilling and refuse to understand the force behind more than a majority of the members of this house seeking to have this opportunity to make the bureaucracy accountable and the cynicism of the american people persists about who runs their governmentis it the elected officials or the unelected bureaucrats then that cynicism is understandable and will grow until the members of this house are given the opportunity to do their will and to express the desires of the american people i think you are going to see more and more fingers pointed at the leadership of this house asking the question why is it that legislation which would require accountability on the part of unelected bureauracts is being locked in a closet pigeonholed and not even given the opportunity for consideration i suggest that there are members of this house who in november when the people get an opportunity to go to the polls and express their concerns about the future of this nation are going to hold the leadership of this house and members of this body accountable for once again frustrating the opportunity and the will and the desire of the american people to be heard on this matter what can be so wrong with a piece of legislation that passed the other body by a unanimous vote by people of both conservative and liberal persuasion by the most conservative senators and by the most liberal senators indeed the senators from your own state the commonwealth of massachusetts supported this legislation as it came through the other body what can be wrong with legislation like that that it is not even possible to let the members of this body speaking on behalf of the american people have that chance to bring accountabflity i do not know what you hear when you go to your district but one of the things that i hear is that the american people are fed up with a bureacracy that will not listen with people who control their lives and livelihood whose names they do not know and if they did could not hold them accountable that is not a phenomenon of this administration or the last administration or the administration before that that is a fact of life about the government we have the american people under our system of government are entitled to look to their elected officials and not be put upon solely by the unelected officials yes there are many indeed most of the people in the civil service of this country are dedicated and reasonable and committed individuals many of whom serve at a sacrifice for the american people and consider themselves public servants but there are others who because of this unaccountability have delegated to themselves decisionmaking powers an imposition on the american people that is unwarranted asi said this is not a liberal or a conservative issue some people have suggested that it is an approach that would favor business as opposed to consumers or environmental groups or public interest groups nothing could be further from the truth it is a twoedged sword the voice of the people can be heard through their elected officials when they cannot even get in the front door of many agencies of government there are many regulations which have been issued by this administration undoing the gains and accomplishments in the field of consumer protection or environmental protection but environmentalists and consumer advocates would have had the opportunity to deal with through regulatory reform and legislative veto just as in other instances the excesses of zealots who have gone too far could have been curbed and restrained and made accountable to the american people where those who did not suffer the inconvenience of running for public office have taken it to themselves to pass rules and regulations affecting every aspect of the life of the american public so therefore i appeal to you i urge you bring this legislation to the floor of this house it would take no more than a word from you for this legislation to come forth and let the members of this house work their will upon it on behalf of the american people failing to do that i fear that many members of this house in the elections that are coming up later this year are going to have to answer to the fact why it was that that which was wanted and desired by the american people control over their own government accountability of the federal bureaucracy was not even given the fair opportunity to be votcd on even through a majority of the members of this house have sponsored legislation to do that that is no way to run a democratic institution and if people have to pay a price for that failure of democracy then it is an appropriate price to be paid the american people want their government to be accountable to them it is indeed a government of the people and by the people and in that way it can be a government for the people therefore i urge you do that which the members of your house the members who elected you speaker of their house have asked for let the regulatory reform legislation and the legislative veto opportunity come to this house so that the members can join with their counterparts in the other body pass this legislation and help restore true democratic principles to our government"], [0.9998617172241211, 0.9998617172241211, 0, "i wish to commend the gentleman in the well for the statement that he just made and wish to join with him in his

rapid deployment would be the c5 the unique features of which make it the best possible plane to do the job in addition the c5 has been improved to better meet our military needs for todays combat situations proponents of the 747 have told us that 48 747s would be equivalent to 50 c5s will save us 6 billion over the next 20 years and will be available for use 3 years earlier at a glance this option would certainly appear to be the more attractive one however the defense experts in closely examining the boeing proposal have informed us that the boeing facts and figures are misleading enough to warrant a much closer look by this body according to the air force the boeing 747 life cycle cost calculations were not done on the same basis as the air force c5 cost calculations and as such do not provide for a fair comparison of the relative costs involved in fact air force price analysts have refuted the 6 billion savings and documented the difference at less than 1 billion over a full 20year cycle of both planes therefore we are really talking about a 900 million difference over 20 years i believe that cost is an important consideration and we should be circumspect and thorough in this regard but we must not lose sight of the basic and overriding concern at the heart of this issue that of military utility while the boeing 747 may cost less in its present capacity as a commercial passenger aircraft the facts will undeniably change if it is to be adapted for military use even if we did add 48 or 55 modified 747s they still would not meet all of the requirements for our military airlift operations boeings own chairman of the board has publicly stated that boeing is not proposing that the 747 be used to carry outsized equipment keeping this in mind i believe our choice of plane seems clear no one can deny that the 747 is a valuable national asset and with modifications would be useful for some deployment missions however the air force has pointed out that a strong civil reserve air fleet modification program through which existing commercial 747s are already available can provide airlift at oneseventh the cost of air force ownership of these aircraft i appreciate that we are and should be very sensitive to the risks and costs of making and selling airplanes in todays economy procurement of 747s would certainly help those who manufacture the aircraft as well as those airlines from which the surplus aircraft would be bought however tempted we may be to aid our ailing industries can we really justify in todays action on this issue relief for some industries or elements of one industry and not provide relief for others we are faced with a decision that affects the mobility deployment effectiveness and response of unitedstates armed forces i cannot stress strongly enough that we are not going to get a bargain if the product we buy cannot do the complete job the 747 will not adequately meet all of our military cargo transport needs and therefore is not cost effective by any measure in closing i urge my colleagues to carefully consider the real issue underlying this debate and support the armed services committee recommendation to buy the c5b and reject the motion favoring the 747"], [0.9998123609984759, 0.00018763900152407587, 1, "i rise in support of the conablehance tax substitute and particularly its provisions encouraging increased personal savings by all americans a brief history of the issue lndicatts the american willingness to save has substantially decreased over the last 10 years by the end of 1978 the rate of disposable income savings in the united states reached a 30year low of under 5 percentfar less than any other western democracy for example great britain has a 13percent savings rate west germany 15 percent and japan 25 percent each of these countries offers generous tax concessions or government bonuses to savers the importance of savings to productivity and our overall economy cannot be overstated onethird of all the capital in this country is made available through personal savings without adequate savings there cannot be sufficient investments in industry small business and home construction the result is higher consumer prices and increased unemploymnent last year recognizing this critical need to stimulate savings the congress enacted two measures that gradually raised the interest a person could receive on his or her savings deposits and allowed 200 400 for couplesof that interest to be taxfree for a 2year experimental period unfortunately while these two landmark laws represented a positive shift in unitedstates economic policy they have not resulted in any noticeable rise in personal savings interest rates on savings deposits have remained close to their original levels and as feared the 200 400 temporary interest tax exclusion does not seem to be enough of an incentive to save in fact studies show that an estimated 95 percent of all the money saved in america is earned by individuals and businesses whose interest and dividends income exceed the 200 400 limit earlier this year i introduced a bill h r 3049 to remedy this situation my legislation would make permanent the current 200 400 tax exclusion on interest and dividends and raise it to 1 000 2 000 for savings interest only in addition my bill would allow all persons age 65 and over to earn taxfree interest on their savings deposits the conablehance substitute offers similar relief aimed at providing a shortterm and much needed boost to our slumping savings and loan and thrift industry under the terms of this legislation depository institutions would be authorized to issue 1year taxexempt savings certificates they would allow single taxpayers to earn as much as 1 000 2 000 for couplesin taxfree interest the certificates which would cost 500 and above would yield 70 percent of the interest rate on 52week treasury bills and would be available for a 15month period beginning on october 1 the certificate would allow depository institutions to retain and attract many of the investment dollars that have recently gone to competing investment opportunities that currently offer higher returns i might add that these pavings certificates are far more prefprable than a proposal that has been offered to lower the returns on competing money market funds rather than penalizing the small saver by eliminating one of their few opportunities to get a fair market return on his or her dollar additional investment opportunities should be made available the taxexempt savings certificates provide such an opportunity as an original member of the house select aging committee i would like to emphasize however that these taxexempt savings certificates are not the final solution to our nations dismal savings rate especially as it relates to the elderly first the certificates would only be offered for a 15month period allowing the troubled depository institutions to revitalize thermselves over a 2year period but falling to provide any longterm relief for either the institutions or the saver second many senior citizens cannot afford to tie up 500 or more of their savings for a 1year period they depend heavily on their savings to pay for daily living expenses including emergency medical needs under the proposed certificate plan a person would receive stiff interest penalties for withdrawing funds early i favor a more flexible savings incentive plan that would incorporate the taxexempt savings certificate idea with the bill i authored providing acrosstheboard taxfree interest for senior citizens unfortunately i am restricted by the rule from offering such a compromise proposal in the form of an amendment as a result i am supporting the taxexempt certificate plan as the most responsible plan under these circumstances and another major step toward permanent and meaningful small saver relief we must not forget however that savings interest represents nearly 25 percent of the total income for persons age 65 and over in additions twothirds of all savings accounts in the united states belong to persons 5 years and older certainly then any longterm small savers relief should address the special needs of our elderly that is why i continue to offer my bill h r 3049 as an effective solution to the savings rate problem in our nation let me finally express my support for the additional savings incentive contained in the substituteincreased retirement investment opportunities under the conablehance amendment the current 1 500 limit on individual retirement account ira contributionrq would be increased to 2 000 2 250 for couples in addition for the first time employees contributing to an employersponsored pension plan could also claim the 2 000 2 250 ira tax deduction in addition the maximum tax deductible contributions to selfemployment keogh retirement plans would double from 7 500 to 15 000 both of these retirement savings in centives are expected to attract millions of new savings dollars while allowing individuals to plan for a more financially secure retirement simply stated increased savings by americans will do as much to stimulate our economy and increase productivity as any other economic tool the conablehance substitute provides responsible and effective tax incentives for savings and i urge that it be adopted today 9"], [0.9996160268783569, 0.9996160268783569, 0, "i welcome now the opportunity to pay tribute to my friend and colleague from south carolina the honorable ken holland and to recognize

4910 seeks to make certain technical and clarifying amendments to the home rule act with respect to the issuance f general obligation bonds and notes and revenue bonds and notes as well as other obligations passage of this legislation would accomplish three major and necessary goals it willfirst eliminate the legal impediments to a successful public offering of d c bonds notes and other obligations second make those technical and conforming amendments which are necessary to resolve several ambiguities relating to the procedures for authorizing and issuing d c bonds notes and other obligations and third give the district of columbia government debt management flexibility comparable to that afforded many other jurisdictions from the beginning of home rule the district has had the authority to issue taxexempt bonds and notes while none have been issued to date passage of this legislation will place thedistrict well on the road to entry into the bond market this proposed legislation does not significantly nor materially alter any provision of the home rule act but simply removes certain ambiguities and legal hurdles which have been noted by the district government and its excellent bond counsel one of the major legal hurdles the district has experienced in contemplating a bond issue is the inability to pay for certain necessary planning costs this inability is due to the current definition of the term capital project in the home rule act section 1 of the bill amends that definition to include certain costs which are not now expressly included reimbursement of expenses for planning payment of incidental financing costs and expenditure for the purchase of equipment or furnishings is expressly provided in the definition these costs are typically included in capital projects in the states the district is simply being placed on equal and in my view firmer footing in this area another legal hurdle lies in the appropriations process for the district because of the line item congressional review of the districts budget there is a cloud of doubt on certainty of payment for bond issues marketing the bonds would thus be difficult the bill removes the annual formal ity of congressional enactment of debt service appropriations and provides assurance to bondholders that bond proceeds will be available as needed under current law debt service payments must be made opi an equal basis this rigid requirement results in limited access to the bond market section 8 of the bill deletes the level debt service requirement thus allowing greater flexibility and improving the prospects for success for district bond issues negotiated sales of bonds is permitted under this legislation the bill also authorizes the issuance of general obligation notes in anticipation of revenues thus positioning the district to respond more easily to cash flow problems the prohibition in subsection b of section 490 of the home rule act against the mortgaging of property as additional security for an issue of revenue bonds is removed by provisions of h r 4910 removal of these legal hurdles is necessary to assure success of district bond issues there are other clarifying and enhancement provisions embodied within h r 4910 one of the important features of this bill is to shore up section 490 of the home rule act which allows in part certain classes of organizations including our local colleges and universities to request the district to issue taxexempt revenue bonds in their behalf a new subsection a of section 490 would remove a perceived limitation and permit the district to issue revenue bonds or notes for refinancing or assistance in refinancing of undertakings by such organizations whether and how referendums on bond issues is to be conducted is unclear under current provisions of the home rule act the bill clarifies the process of referendum when issuing general obligation bonds by mandating that the district of columbia council establish a firm policy questions have been raised about the federal governments obligation to repay the districts debts from a bond issue in the event the district fails to do so h r 4910 affirmatively states that the full faith and credit of the united states is not pledged to the payment of principal or interest on any bond note or other obligation issued by the district because of these impediments to the districts entry into the bond market that i have described the district goverrnent has had no alternative but to continue to borrow funds at a premium from the unitedstates treasury to finance its capital improvements this borrowing authority will expire on october 1 1982 or on the date of enactment of the d c appropriations act for fiscal year 1983 whichever is later if the congress is to avoid a further extension the district must be given the legal means of accessing the municipal bond market passage of h r 4910 will remove the impediments and will facilitate less dependence by the district onthe unitedstates treasury a goal which all of us share the provisions of h r 4910 will in no way relieve the district from adequately addressing and resolving all financial problems and satisfying the creditworthiness tests of the municipal bond market bond ratings will be necessary and the district must convince potential investors that it will sustain balanced annual budgets and develop and pursue an acceptable method of eliminating the existing accumulated operating deficit in short the market will ultimately determine whether the bonds can be sold or not it should also be noted that the 14percent limit on the use of bonds as contained in the home rule act remains in place on november 12 1981 following the hearing the subcommittee met to mark up h r 4910 the bill was approved without objection and ordered favorably reported to the full committee together with any technical amendments deemed necessary by counsel on november 17 1981 the committee on the district of columbia met to mark up h r 4910 the bill was approved with four technical amendmnents by unanimous vote and ordered reported to the 11ouse h r 4910 is a bipartisan effort

the gun control act of 1968 to provide for separate offense and consecutive sentencing in felonies involving the use of a firearm or other deadly weapon under current law anyone who uses or carries a firearm when committing a felony as defined by federil law must be sentenced to not less than 1 year and not more than 10 years in addition to the sentenuce imposed for the underlying felony it self under this law it is possible for th~ose convicted to receive a suspended selitence a probationary sentence and also parole second or subsequent convictions require a sentence of an additional 2 to 25 years and the court does not have the discretion to suspend it or impose a probationary sentence howeyer parole is still possible the purpose of my bill is to see that those convicted of carrying a firearm or other deadly weapon do not avoid imprisonment as we have discovered through experience leaving the length of the prison sentence to the discretion of the court often allows offenders to return to society after having received few if any ipcnaltie8 for their crimes free to resume their criminal activity because of the uncertainty of imprisonment the offender knows the chances nre great that even if convicted he will spend little time in prison and once again he will be out on the streets victimizing innocent hardworking productive members of society it is this injustice that i propose to help remedy with my biill the most important provision of h r 35 imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on anyone convicted and it removes the possibility of parole specifically the first time a person is convicted of coznmittinv a felony with the use of a dangerous weapon he would receive not less than a 1year prison sentence which would be served in its entirety in addition to any other sentence for the commission of the crime itself a felon who is convicted a second time would receive a minimum 5year prison term over and above any other prison sentence while these provisions remove any discretion by the judge in sentencing below the minimum or granting a suspended or probationary sentence the court does retain discretion as to thle length of the sentence so long as it remains within the minimum and maximum set by law however and i wish lo stress this point no matter what length the sentence it must be served in its entirety in prison once the sentence has been imposed the judge may not suspend it or any part of it nor may he grant a probationary sentence for any part of it nor may the felon be paroled the number of years the judge declares as sentence in court will be tile number of years served by the felon in prison i do not regard my bill as the soiution to our societys problems with crime i do believe however that my proposal will be more effective in putting those who are a danger to our society in prison than our present system under my proposal the risk of imprisonment is increased by the certainty of punishment whereas under the present law the chance exists that a person convicted of a crime will not have to serve any time at all there is no certainty of punishment and very little risk which might serve to deter unlawful behavior also if penalizing the use of dangerous weapons during the commission of a felony has any deterrent effect at all it could well have a larger effect on deterring crime in general by deterring the use of weapons the law is punishing the criminals means of coercion if he is deterred at all he will be less likely to commit crimes of coercion since he will be less likely to carry a weapon i

of home rule because language restrictions are often times attached to the annual appropriation bills for the district of columbia he went on to cite examples such as the provision prohibiting the use of funds to implement a hiring system that uses a drawing to rank prospective police officers and firefighters who pass the written test the restriction on the transfer of sludge outside the district of columbia and the denial of funds for the local gambling board let me make it very clear that certainly congress can and does place restrictions on the use of funds but there is really no comparison between restrictions on the use of money and the disapproval of a local ordinance which has been approved by locally elected officials let me explain why with respect to the police and fire hiring policy the language placed in the appropriation bill does indeed prohibit the city from implementing the system of a drawing to detcrmine the selection order of those who pass the written test but this system was put in place as an administrative matter by the mayor with the city councils consent it did not go through the length process which gives all those who wish a chance to be heard on an issue and results in an ordinane that comes from those most directly involved on the second issue the house merely provided a temporary 60day delay in the transporting of sludge to a new landfill that is much different than completely turning around a statute that has been debated and approved by the local legislature and chief executive concerning the gambling board there was no language in the appropriation bill prohibiting the use of funds for implementing the gambling initiative the house did absolutely nothing on that proposal so the gentlemens argument that his disapproval resolution does nothing more than what is done through language on appropriation bills is spurious and not supported by the facts let me say at this point that even though language provisions are included on appropriation bills many members feel that it is wrong for the congress to dictate how the local government should spend revenues which for the most part are raised from taxes fees and charges imposed on local residents i realize this is an emotional issue and that many of the points in d c act 469 may not have been fully explained arid although the congress has the authority to place language in an appropriations measure that limits the use of funds or delays an effective date there can be no question in anyones mind that such language provisions are entirely different than disapproving a local ordinanceone that has received the benefit of public hearings and the leadership and approval of a locally elected mayor and city council the facts do not support the comparison the gentleman from illinois attempted to make earlier and even if the facts were accurate one wrong does not justify another regardless the gentlemans disapproval resolution goes deeper in that it pierces the veil of integrity as far as the issue of local selfgovernment and home rule are concerned it is clear that the government of the district of columbia acted within its authority in passing the sexual assault reform act in doing so it was acting within the authority which is was granted under the home rule act of 1973 passage of this resolution of disapproval would be a clear and dangerous violation of home rule although since 1973 there have been 10 resolutions of disapproval considered in only one instance when the council attempted to dictate location of chanceries was such a resolution passed and the law overturned in that instance there was a clear and compelling federal interest i do not believe such a case can be made here it should be noted that some 24 states have enacted provisions regarding sexual assault and sexual conduct among consenting adults which are consistent with the law passed by the district of columbia city council beyond this fact though this act neither violates the constitution exceeds the authority granted under home rule nor violates a federal interest it is a sad day when the clarion call of a small band of zealots in this body railroad legitimately enacted laws because those laws do not meet their standard of morality the singleminded nature of this resolution will make a mockery of progress toward home rule here in the district of columbia passage of this disapproval will assure the residents of this city that for all the talk about home rule and the need to encourage selfgovernance the congress remains ready to

rural development insurance fund for alcohol production facilities these funds are to be made available in an expeditious manner under a restructuring of this program provided in h r 4119 house conferees receded to am indment no 16 which directs the economic development administration to maintain the number of economic development representatives in the various states at 47 the amendment further directs that where possible the individuals who held those positions on june 1 1981 should retain their jobs the effect of the amendment is to deny a reorganization request from the eda to eliminate these positions in the defense area both defense and military construction are at fiscal 1981 levels and were not conference items mx deplgyment construction and bomber procurement are not allowed to proceed under the 1981 restrictive language which remains in effect for the life of the continuing resolution the conferees agreed to provide 600 000 for the yorktown bicentennial celebration instead of the 750 000 recommended by the senate no funds were included by the house these funds will be used by the department of defense to proceed with plans and implementation of dod participation in this event it was essential that we include the funds here so their plans can proceed rather than awaiting a final defense appropriation in late november or december the report clarifies house language concerning military pay and allowances by stating our intent that overseas costofliving payments be made at the rate which normally would take effect tomorrow to do otherwise would be unfair finally the conferees agreed on report language allowing the secretary of defense to take necessary steps under existing law to correct the wage rate disparity at the national guard group in wichita kans and other trouble areas if he determines such rates are no longer competitive house conferees accepted senate amendment no 44 which provides 125 million for unitedstates participation in the multinational force and observers in the sinai to meet unitedstates commitments under the camp david agreements while these funds have not yet been authorized an appropriation at this time is essential if this multinational force is to be in place by march 20 1982 as specified by the agreements a provision included prevents these funds from being used for the actual participation of unitedstates troops in this multinational force without prior authorization by congress another provision may be added on the house floor whenamendments in technical disagreement are considered which would limit the amount which could be expended prior to authorization to not more than 20 million this conference report provides that the programs of the department of housing and urban development and independent agencies will be continued at the rate and in the manner provided for in the conference report to the fiscal year 1982 hud appropriations bill report no 97222 which was agreed to in the house on september 15 the conferees were aware of the concern that exists regarding the future of the epa wastewater treatment construction grants program because no funds for this program are included in the fiscal year 1982 hud appropriations conference report the conferees have therefore included language in this conference report reaffirming the intention to make an adequate level of funds available for the epa construction grants program in fiscal year 1982 as soon as the congress has completed work on the pending construction grants reform legislation and upon receipt of the promised administration budget request for this program for the department of the interior and related agencies the continuing resolution would continue the activities of these agencies at the current rate or the rate provided in h r 4035 as passed by the house on july 22 whichever is lower the conferees are agreed on the importance of continuing efforts to fill the strategic petroleum reserve but in keeping with the provisions of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 which was adopted after the house had passed the fiscal year 1982 interior appropriations bill the house accepts the senate amendment providing that funds necessary for oil acquisition and transportation costs related to spro shall be carried off budget the continuing resolution provides for the extension of current law concerning abortion essentially that language says none of the funds made available shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term provided however that the several states are and shall remain free not to fund abortions to the extent th at they in their sole discretion deem appropriate the resolution extends the current law language prohibiting prevention of voluntary prayer programs in public schools the joint resolution provides such sums as may be necessary during fiscal year 1982 for closeout expenses of the community services administration the committee intended that these funds also be available to continue to pay career senior executives of the community services administration as required by law until these senior executives are reassigned the house receded to a technical amendment by the senate concerning the provision of impact aid funds the amendment as accepted relieves the secretary from making impact aid pa yments to school districts within 30 days after the beginning of the fiscal year in an amount equal to 75 percent of the amount they received in the previous fiscal year this amendment was accepted because the appropriation for impact aid for fiscal 1982 will be less than 75 percent of the current years level the conferees made clear however that the secretary shall make payments as needed to those school districts heavily dependent upon impact aid for maintenance and operations of local schools the conferees included in the statement of the managers language that indicated that it is the understanding of the conferees that the resolution contains sufficient funds and authority to operate the office of adolescent pregnancy for the duration of the resolution to maintain the option for congress to consider future funding for the adolescent family life program there is no statement in the conference agreement concerning the public health service hospitals under the rate of operations prescribed by the resolution the secretary would have 25 million available for conversion activities for those hospitals whose conversion plans are approved chairman natcher and senator schmitt agreed during the conference to write the secretary a letter indicating that he should maintain as much flexibility as possible in funding and approving conversion proposals since more funds for conversion might be forthcoming in the fiscal 1982 appropriations bill in regard to pay and related issues the senate rcceded on an amendment no 13 which had proposed a relaxation of the federal pay cap in the house bill to the extent that increases would have been allowed for executive levels iii iv and v the effect of the conferees action is to extend the pay cap for members of congress high executive branch officials and the judiciary through november 20 1981 house conferees receded to the senate on amendment no 35 which eliminates the 25 000 ceiling on honoraria which can be received in any year by federal employees including members of the unitedstates senate house members are limited to 15 percent of congressional salary for such income amendment no 38 also includes language providing a permanent appropriation in future years for ~compensation of members as authorized by law at levels recommended by the president for other federal employees the conferees also agreed to remove the statutory 3 000 limit on living expenses which can be deducted from federal taxes by members of congress while away from home amendment no 46 states that it is the sense of congress that limits on such deductions should be the same as the limits for businessmen and other private citizens on the issue oi the report language which relates to amtrak rail service i must say that i am dismayed with the decision to extend special treatment to the cardinal train this train represents the most political route in the amtrak system it has failed consistently to attain the congressionally required criteria for longhaul trains yet it remains in service for a select few a recent amtrak management recommendation to the amtrak board of directors indicates that this route again fails to meet the performance criteria that we had estatiished in this congress after a great deal of debate in fact the route is projected to attain only 122 passengermiles per trainmile figure the requirement for continuation of this line has been decided by the congress to be no less than 150 the report states it is therefore our judgment that the cardinal should be discontinued it is ludicrous to offer special treatment to this poor performance train at the expense of superior train routes which can better serve the publics traveling needs i am pleased to report that there is no language in this resolution which precludes the secretary of transportation from implementing the washington national airport policy plan the resolution offers the secretary the necessary flexibility regarding implementation as many of you are aware the plan is designed to assure the maximum safety of air operations in the washington area reduce noise and congestion at national airport and encourage the greater use of dulles international airport this longoverdue plan is one which should not be sidetracked by a few special interest groups the policy attempts to balance the competing interests of airlines their passengers congress and the residents of the washington area in developing this equitable plan safety as always was given the

fair trade in steel act it would benefit the house to hear the words of sir roy denman on the idea of free trade as it is understood today in europe sir roy is director general for external affairs of the commission of the european communities so his understanding is complete he explained it in the united states just last month and he said this of the steel crisis the trading rules do not declare dumping illegal what is at issue is whether dumping to the extent that it exists is causing material injury to the unitedstates industry we think that any such claim is moonshine moonshine in sir roys useage is empty talk he said we are clear that the unitedstates steel industry has launched a massive campaign of harass ment against european exporters meanwhile there are 134 837 american steelworkers in what sir roy depicts as an empty jug of harassment about 106 258 of them are out of work specifically because apparently dumped and subsidized steelmuch of it from europehas stolen up to 26 percent of the unitedstates market for months running and 28 579 are on short weeks for the year to date imports account for 22 8 percent of available supply steel is the industrial material that is basic to virtually everything else made or done in the united states it is the cornerstone of industry and defense steel was stressed in the presidents campaign for election and all the concerns for modernization and competitiveness were focused on it and other basic industries at this time last year we had wanted to have steel by now well on the road to rehabilitation and congress moved half of heaven and all of the tax code to get it and the other basic industries moving but steel now is at the point of widespread failure and harmful contraction because it is a target for attack in the current trade war waged by friends and allies with enough brass to say the trading rules do not declare dumping illegal while steel the linchpin needs time and profit to modernize less efficient but subsidized and governmentcapitalized and cartelized foreign producers carry away jobs and pages from the order books these producers have been called to answer according to the trade laws of the united states which do say dumping is illegal but decisions are pending and during the months of their pendancy the apparent dumpers and pushers of subsidized steel have not slacked their pace if anything they seem determined to send in as much as possible in the time remaining and if the findings go against them i suggest they will not be long in finding new and clever ways to try to circumvent the countervailing duties and tariffs that are levied they always havethere is no need to change now after all we have sir roys testimony that in europe their policy is that the trading rules do not declare dumping illegal if this was a case to be argued in court this statement would be admissible as evidence in judging intent and predicting fuiture conduct and in this sense a temporary quota is obviously no more than a civil injunction that would prevent a willful and malicious party from doing irreparable harm to an already injured party the fair trade in steel act basically sets a 5year quota of approximately 10 million tons a year for all of our trading partners most of whom subsidize and practice dumping as the facts will show this quota amounts to about onetenth of normal unitedstates demand and it is the equivalent then to a tithe for the wellbeing of our partners and the developing nations who want steel industries ahead of food for their people the holy bible a guide for moral conduct in the united states says the tithe is a fair portion and a quota is an equitable remedy quotas are necessary because they cannot be easily circumvented testimony to their effectiveness is that this budgetwatching administration recently imposed an import quota on sugar so it would not have to pay almost 1 billion in subsidies to domestic producers the cause was an oversupply of sugar prices dropped and imports of cheap foreign sugar surged and the unitedstates government was obligated to take up the slack under political commitment the idea is to save a domestic industry from failure domestic steel because it goes into everything is far more critical and has a dramatically higher claim for a quota of course steel gets no government price support and it obtained no real commitment it is only a critical industry that is in crisis the point at which it must get better or die and none of this is moonshine nor is it a campaign of harassment all of this is reason to act because the facts point to irreparable harm for which america will pay and pay and pay in ways that cannot even be guessed at if the steel industry disintegrates i ask those who are concerned about the survival of industrial america to examine some facts that have developed only since the first of the month the wall street journal for luesday june 1 reported that in belgium the government has sent still another restructuring plan for one of its steelmakers to sir roys common market the government plan is aimed at getting cockerillsambre s a out of the red by 1985 in the united states steelmakers get out of the red by themselves or go into bankruptcy court with their creditors nevertheless belgium provides 18 specific subsidies to 7 steelmakers according to a recently published study of the american iron steel institute and these subsidies range from interest free loans to assistance in research and development to help in the purchase of coking coal yet in march 15 000 belgian steelworkers shook the peace when they took to the streets to protest a planned overhaul of outdated and inefficient and uncompetitive mills the plan would have caused unemployment we are fortunate that so far none of the 134 837 american steelworkerswho are more efficient but who cannot compete with foreign government subsidy and dumpingare in the streets instead of riot reports we get news like the story in that same june 1 paper that workers of laclede steel in st louis voted to accept a 15 percent cut and that the cut was approved by 63 percent of the workers you see they would rather work than riot they did it to try to keep their company going in the face of apparently dumped and subsidized imports from countries like belgium with its 18 subsidies the same thing is happening across industrial america by the way laclede had a reported first quarter loss of 3 2 million the first quarter was one of unprecedented import tonnage much of it from our european trading partners who worry about the politics of steel and not the economics"], [0.00033921003341674805, 0.5003392100334167, 1, "i am inserting in the record at

constitutional amendment to change the terms of office for members of congress the first resolution which i have already introduced limits members of the unitedstates house of representatives to six 2year terms and members of the unitedstates senate to two 6year terms it is a companion bill to senate joint resolution 25 the second resolution which i am introducing today increases the length of terms of members of the united states house of representatives from 2 to 4 years with staggered elections being held so that half of the house will be elected every 2 years and limits the number of terms which can be served by house and senate members due to the problems of reapportionment every 10 years this proposed constitutional amendment would require that every seat in the house be up for election each year ending in the number 2 and this provision together with the system designed to have equal and staggered elections on all other occasions results in one or two 2year terms following each reapportionment because of this the proposed amendment would allow some members to serve as long as 14 years in the unitedstates house as with the first resolution senators are limited to two 6year terms my overriding concern in introducing two alternative resolutions is with gaining a reasonable limitation on terms of office in both houses of congress and stimulating the debate in the legislative process necessary to achieve this my personal preference is for the amendment i am introducing today which includes a modified form of lengthening the terms of office of house members to 4 years the present 2year term of members of the unitedstates house came from a compromise by those who wanted a 1year term and those who wanted a 3year term at the constitutional convention in 1787 when the 2year term was approved on june 21 1787 it was so much of a compromise that the only person who spok n favor of it was george mason during the first 39 congresses there was little challenge to the 2year term in the 40th congress on february 8 1869 there was introduced the first recorded resolution to lengthen the house term and it provided for a term of 4 years since 1869 only five con gresses have not seen the introduction of at least one proposal to alter the house terms altogether there have been over 200 constitutional amendments introduced to lengthen the house term the closest congress has come to such a decision was a vote in 1906 of 89 in favor to 86 opposed but the effort to gain a 4year house term failed to achieve the twothirds majority required for passage in 1951 president harry s truman proposed a 4year term for members of the house and later urged a limit of 12 years of service on each body of congress in 1955 president dwight eisenhower supported the 4year term for house members and also later ad vocated a limit of 12 years of service in 1966 president lyndon b johnson urged the lengthening of house terms to 4 years and in 1973 president richard nixon advocated the same in 1979 the subcommittee on the constitution of the senate judiciary committee held hearings on the subject but no legislation was forthcoming the idea of limiting terms of con gressen is not new either but only modern political realities have made its enactment a necessity and sparked public and congressional interest the earliest proposed constitutional amendment to limit terms was introduced in the first congress in 1789 the resolution in that congress stipulated that no person could serve more than 6 years in an 8year period actually the concept predated our constitution the continental congress adopted a proposal by john dickinson of delaware in 1777 limiting delegates under the articles of con federation to serving 3 years in any 6year period however after the first congress the issue of limiting terms lay dormant until the mid1940s the primary reason for this dormancy was the tradition in the early years of our country to serve only two terms in the unitedstates house and then retire as late as the 1840s 40 to 50 percent of the con gress left office at each election from 1860 to 1920 the average length of service doubled from 4 to 8 years by 1901 when the 57th congress convened for the first time less than 30 percent of its members were fresh men in 1981 when the 97th congress convened only 17 percent of the unitedstates house of representatives were fresh men perhaps the most significant development in recent times has been the tremendous growth in public support for both lengthening terms of house members to 4 years and limiting terms of all members of congress a 1946 gallup poll showed 40 percent of the american public favoring lengthening terms of house members to 4 years by 1961 51 percent of the public supported 4year terms and this was approximately the same in 1977 however in the most recent gallup poll published in the washington post on may 17 1981 a clear 59 percent of the american people support the lengthening of terms of house members to 4 years that same poll shows that by a margin of 2 to 1 the american public wants to limit unitedstates senators and representatives to a maximum of 12 years in office the degree of support was similar in all population groups studied by the poll including both political parties and all levels of education the american people have spoken and it is time to both limit terms of congressmen and to lengthen the terms of house members the two go hand in hand the simple fact is that the concern of most congressmen for getting reelected causes them to spend a good deal of their time and energy on matters related to that and often influences their decision by taking away from what would otherwise be the course of their better judgment a limitation on terms would assure that a substantial portion of congress at any one time would be ineligible for reelection and virtually unfettered by the constraints of reelection concerns if in addition to limiting terms there were a lengthening of the terms of house members from 2 to 4 years there would be even more relief from the effects of reelection concerns on the actions effectiveness and efficiency of individual congressmen at the present time a member of the house feels compelled to almost literally start reelection efforts as soon as he is elected since in the world of politics 2 years go by very quickly under those circumstances the career politician is bound to be worried most of the time about reelection and this can easily be to the detriment of performing his legislative duties the sensible thing to do is to free as many congressmen from as much of these pressures as possible while still keeping them responsive to the public the best way to do this is by limiting terms and in the case oi the house by lengthening the terms and staggering the elections so that half the members of the house are on the ballots every even year general election it is not enough to simply limit the terms congress has become a career for many which was never envisioned by our founding fathers in the early days congress would meet for 2 months a year or so and meeting for 3 months was a really big year a congressman was a citizen legislator who would go home after a session and spend most of his time running his business or practicing law or whatever in modern times the sheer size and volume of the business of the federal government has made service in congress a fulltime job and many who have come to washington have given up their jobs back home and with each passing year of congressional service are more reluctant to go back home and reenter the job market as a result the tendency for a great many is to stay as long as possible and they have been very successful as evi denced by the fact that since world war ii 93 percent of incumbents seek ing reelection have been returned to congress in the process legislative involvement suffers as time is devoted constantly to reelection concerns to protect the career the result is an often stagnant and inefficient congress the result is many longterm legislators who have become washingtonians who have a tendency to lose touch with life back home the result is that the longer one remains in washington the more likely one becomes convinced that societys problems can or should be solved by the federal government the result is many members of congress who are more interested in getting reelected than acting in the best interests of the country and devoting the time necessary to excel at public policymaking we need a much larger turnover in congress on a regular basis to revitalize representative government bring ing into service men and women with more diverse backgrounds who have a fresh impression of what it is like living back home under the conditions created in large measure by the federal government and who have the fire burning in them to motivate congress to make the changes necessary if the federal government is to work further if terms were limited there would be created a perception among the people that one does not have to be in congress for many years in order to play a significant role in the process and undoubtedly more men and women would be willing to make the sacrifice of temporarily leaving careers in businesses and professions which hold the promise of great financial success to make a try for congress and the total number of high quality candidates and the level of debate of the issues for each office would improve there is little question that the constant concern of most members over reelection causes them to spend a disproportionate amount of time fundraising and in many cases playing to the media one of the most timeconsuming parts of the reelection campaign proc ess for members is fundraising the cost and expense of running campaigns in the era of electronic media is staggering to offset as much of the cost as possible members tend to play to both the print and electronic media on a regular basis during sessions of congress in hopes of gaining such high name recognition among the voters that challengers will be few and far between and unsuccessful certainly the public needs a constant line of communication open to elected representatives and no one advocates restricting this interplay in the print and electronic media however there needs to be a restriction on the motivating fsctors which cause too many congressmen to spend too much time creating opportunities for media exposure not to communicate but to insulate thenmelves from reelection challenges then there is the work schedule dictated largely by reelection considerations which affects the efficiency of the individual congressman it is not uncommon for a congressman to work until 9 or 10 oclock each night board a plane on friday to go back to the district and work equally as hard meeting with groups and individuals throughout the district he then flies back on monday morning expected to be fit and ready for a serious hearing or the other important business of congress the workload is enormous compounded with the relentless pressure of reelection considerations this component of public service in congress does not make for a very effective or efficient legislative body on the other side of the coin are those congressmen who have been in office so long that they have truly insulated themselves from reelection challenges and only occasionally return to the district they generally take legislative business seriously but without the needed sense of urgency and without contact with the fresh ideas that come only from direct contact with the people both extremes are bad and both extremes are what dominate congess today now none of this is to say that we do not have good talented men and women presently serving in congress we do in fact all that is accomplished given the pressures involved is a tribute to the exceptional quality of those serving in the house and senate as a whole but the system is riddled with problems that most members of congress will admit privately if not publicly which are in large measure derived from the forces at work when you have fulltime career congressmen constantly concerned with reelection to save those careers the essential constitutional duty of the congress is the duty to legislate on behalf of the american people in his book waging peace dwight d eisenhower wrote that each person serving under term limitation wlould tend to think of his congressional career as an important and exciting inter lude in his life a period dedicated to the entire public rather than as a way of making a living or making a career of exercising continuous political power more rapid turnover of the membership in both houses with its constant infusion of new blood would largely eliminate the career politician in congress but i can se little damage that would result from such a change except possibly to the personal ambitions of particular individuals he went on to say that experience may produce greater skill in political maneuvering in the legislative process but does not necessarily produce better statesmen many of his observations apply as well to the need to lengthen terms of house members the resolution i am introducing today comes the closest possible to providing three 4year terms for house members under the staggeredterm concept in my judgment staggered terms whereby as close as possible to half the membership of the house is up for election every 2 years are essential to maintaining the house as that body of congress closest to the people if all house elections coincided with that of the president there could very well form a pattern of greater straight ticket voting and the voters would not have the opportunity to hold any portion of the house members accountable for a course in government which might be undertaken against the popular will in this situation an important check in the great system of checks and balances created by our founding fathers would be lost lengthening terms of house members is an important supplement to limiting the terms to correct the problems which have clearly arisen but it should not be done in a manner which could threaten the checks and balances system which forms the bulwark of our constitutional goverment because reapportionment requires a redistribution of congressional seats among the states every 10 years and a redrawing of district lines it is impossible to have a staggered system of electing house members to three consecutive 4year terms the resolution i have introduced takes this into account and provides for the election of all house members once every 10 years following reapportionment and thereafter a resumption of staggered 4year terms as a result a member could conceivably serve 2year terms on two occasions and remain a member for as long as 14 years although 12 years is the common base of the limitation the senate elections do not pose this problem and the limitation is for two 6year terms the price of a free society is the eternal vigilance of the people as clearly stated in the recent gallup poll the people have spoken and the cavalier manner with which the issues of limiting terms of congressmen and lengthening house terms has been treated for the most part in past congresses is directly contrary to the very essence of liberty and representative government upon which this nation was founded i call upon my colleagues to join in a concerted effort to bring about the debate and hearings necessary to resolve the differences among the members and the people and meld together an appropriate constitutional amendment that both limits terms of congressmen and lengthens those of the house as well"],

disruptive furloughs and reductions in force especially in the departments of educaton health and human services and labor the committee bill also included 81 6 milliod for the bureau of government financial operations in the treasury department this provides the administrative funds for the bureau that actually writes about 50 million checks a month over 50 percent of these checks are for routine entitlement payments to social security recipients and veterans treasury officials now estimate funds may run out the last few days of may this involves checks issued to veterans and social security ecipients federal employees state governments or contractors doing business with the government it is imperative that funds be provided soon for these vitally needed programs i am afraid that any additional delay will be damaging not only to the programs but to the congress itself if the congress is perceived as unable to act quickly to avoid these program disruptions its standing with the public will be greatly diminished the congress must not allow the perception to grow that it is unable to execute its duties in a timely and responsible manner also provided here are funds for howard university domestic programs under action bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms department of commerce economic development administration and the noaa operations research facility i wish to call special attention to the section of the report which accompanies this bill under the waste treatment construction grant program of the environmental protection agency this addresses a widespread problem arid especially affects areas such as i represent the language is as follows geographical and climatic conditions can affect certain biological treatment facilities however many rural communities especially in warmer climates appear to be ideally suited for these less expensive treatment techniques the committee directs the agency to provide expeditious guidance tosmall communities concerning the revised secondary treatment definition which will be beneficial in planning for future facilities in additidn the committee is aware that several communities have been saddled with expensive wastewater treatment facilities when an oxidation pond or lagoon might have been equally effective and much cheaper the committee further directs the agency to review these situations and allow communities to take advantage of the new secondary treatment definition where appropriate language has been included in the bill in this regard allowing the administrator to make grants to small communities for biological treatment facilities to repair or replace systems where determined to be necessary two other items that concern members from throughout the country are provided for in this billfunding for the coast guard and the weather stations the committee is recommending an additional 17 5 million for the coast guard to continue the operations of all search and rescue stations previously proposed for closure and the vessel traffic systems in various cities in addition the bill provides an additional amount for the continued operations of 38 weather service stations proposed for closing by the administraton for the balance of the year we in the congress and we in this nation have been faced with certain differences of opinion by the executive department and by some of our committees in the congress including the committee on the budget several years ago i pointed out the fact that 58 percent of federal spending bypassed our appropriations committee by entitlements and by binding contracts though our appropriations committee had held appropriations below the budget for 37 out of 38 years this year we are running behind i was appointed senior cochairman of the study group which recommended the congressional budget act to regain control of spending by providing for setting targets holding hearings and then reconciling income and outgo unfortunately the budget resolution set aside the provisions of the budget act and set firm figures and reconciliation on the first resolution rather than the last it is this action which has caused the delay and upset the regular operations of the congress as a result of the recommendations which our study committee made the rules were changed and the congressional budget act was passed in the rules committee yesterday i was asked if we should amend the budget act i answered not until we try it if we are going to get back into orderly procedure and tend to the business of the country in an orderly manner we are going to have to see that the provisions of the act are enforced to do that the budget resolution should be kept in line with what the budget act calls for now in addition to that we have had reconciliation on the first resolution the act calls for this to come at the end on the second resolution to attach reconciliation to the first means we tie the hands of the congressand make regular procedures impossible the result is that we have been here since march 23 trying to get urgent supplemental before you not only is that true but i would like to point out other things this as we all know is a government of three equal and coordinate branches we have got to pull together and we need to pull togetherexecutive judicial and legislative but the branch closest to the people the peoples branch the one they have to look to for protection is the legislative branch now as a result trying to pull to gether your committee on appropriations last year on recommendations by the president to rescind 15 1 billion in prior appropriations we rescinded 14 3 billion you will recall my friends that last year we were asked to go along with the march budget which provided for about 10 percent further cut which we did then we were asked last november to make a further reduction and we went along again that is when we stayed up two nights in a row and the republican senators on the senate side and our friends over here signed it and then it was vetoed on monday morning it did not bother me because that is the responsibility of the president but we have tried to cooperate the presidents package when it came returned a big part of the windfall profits tax then it allowed those corporations making the most money to purchase tax credits from other companies and avoid taxes the president of course hoped that those people would invest that money in special exploration and expansion of their business instead they bought other companies or purchased government notes becasue of the high rate of interest at the time i bring this urgent sup plemental bill to the members we have spent over 24 billion in unemployment compensation it would have been so much better if this amount had been spent for productive work then taxes would have been paid and we would have increased production and not more unemployment we cannot have people stop work stop producing and stop exporting agricultural products and have enough earnings to handle what we already owe so i think it is becoming evident now that despite the high hopes that many of us had that this program is not working so i say to my colleagues that we are doing our best to hold down but it is just as essential to carry on the necessary functions of the government to carry on the activity in private enterprise to make it worthwhile for them to do that you just cannot cut down on what is essential and ope to handle what you already owe so i am proud of our effort here to put people back to work in productive work merely distributing money as we do with unemployment compensation is not going to help us recover actually the funds we have saved are not going toward paying our debts they are going to increase military spending from our investigation that is quite different from getting more defense it is also going to increase foreign aid at a time when we have that need for aid right here at home do members know that if they go back and look at how much waste we may have had in the military and how much we have spent in foreign aid it probably equals more than the whole outstanding obligations of the government whatever their merits and i am not attacking their merits at this time but it is whatever we can do the defense of this country is dependent upon a sound economy if it is foreign aid we had better keep our economy strong first then consider whether we can afford it i was told this morning that it would be difficult to keep people from buying cheaper steel in west germany than here well let us think about that if you buy steel from germany they have our money and we have the steel but if you buy steel here at home we have the steel and the money at the same time everyone seems to quote economists they can make a guess and if they need another answer they can change an assumption just a small change in an assumption will bring quite a change many economists are like it is said architects they like to be different and then we get to interest interest is sometime described as rent we pay for the use of money it follows that the present tight money policy leads to the high interest we have and a partial remedy would let up a little on the tight money policy so i say to you that as we come to you today we have done our part in holding down to essential programs that are necessary to protect and help restore our economy programs we should have acted on some time ago"], [0.0008304715156555176, 0.5008304715156555, 0, "i thank my colleague the gentleman from illinois
