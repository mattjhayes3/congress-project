what i would like to do is simply repeat the remarks that i gave in california in san francisco at a commemoration a memorial tribute to one of the great people of the house sala burton basically what i said was that to me sala burton had the glamour of a marlene deitrich and the heart and good will of a mother teresa and the political savvy of a golda meir if anyone read the congressio al record when my distin guished colleague mr edwards dean of the california delegation introduced the privilege resolution they would know the overwhelming expression of grief and love for sala she was really a mother a sister and a friend to all of us she cared in a very special way for people she really did love her roots her family her country the congress and she had a real affectionthose callfornians stick togetherfor the california delegation she certainly loved san francisco she was extremely proud to represent and it was americas perfect city with its great diversity of people she meant very very much to the wives of the members of course she was the cofounder of the congressional wives task force and always reached out to make them feel a part of congress sala often told me of the pride and love she had for her daughter and her soninlaw and her grandchildren she admired her daughters abilities and independence her parents meant very very much to her her mother still is living god bless her and she had a marvelous impression from her parents she often talked about her fathers brilliance and her mothers common sense and their interest in current affairs she was very proud of her brotherinlaw john and believed he had tremendous values as did her husband and values that are known in california indeed nationally as the great burton tradition she was proud of johns personal courage as well and proud of her brotherinlaw bob as well she was very very proud of her brother and her nephew tom who was so gracious to so many of us during salas illness i want to say this about her staff she felt that they were an extended part of her family and they ought to know how much affection sala had for them and how much it meant to her that they carried on during her illness so in a very special way all of us can claim sala in a very real way of course she loved her beloved phillip as she would say you could not talk to her for any length of time without knowing of the respect and love she had for her husband she quoted him often she felt even after he died that she was an extension of him but sala in her own right was a magnificent congresswoman and a very savvy politician she was intensely political and long before she became a congresswoman she served her political apprenticeship she traced her interest to her childhood in prewar poland she said i saw and felt what happened n western europe when the nazis were moving you learn politics is everybodys business she had instant clout in the house when we look at her assignments we see that she was practically hmmedlately after a term of being here assigned to the prestigious committee the committee on rules she was a delegate to the north atlantic assembly where 60 parliamentarians from nato elected her vice chair of the political committee last spring in luxembourg i saw her chair the committee and i saw the love and esteem of our allies and our fellow and sister parliamentarians who really thought that she was so outstanding she knew how to get things done one can recall the many instances in which sala did in fact buttonhole her friends i said in san francisco that she buttonholed the men in congress by flicking the lint from their lapels rather than twisting their arms her style was different from phils to say the least but it was equally as effective so how do we accept her death one of the things that sala was most proud of really was her jewish background so i quoted from the mourners kaddish in which there are a line or two that indicate that thru the long centuries and this is a quote from that beautiful prayer thru the long centuries we have learned to rise in the face of every storm out of the abyss of anguish on the ashes of every destruction to praise gods name to maintain a stance of human dignity and to affirm our consecration to the task of life that was her goal life was so important to her and she was consecrated to this the wednesday before salas death i had the great privilege of visiting her along with senator alan cranston and my friend and colleague the gentleman from california don edwands and at the end i whispered a few words to sala and she said to me and the last words she said to me were tell everyone i think of them and love them and she said goodbye mary rosewell talk which was a common expression of saas we will talk about salafor we will think of her legacy and her values that wonderful burton tradition we know that already there have been a number of things that people are proposing to name after her such as the sala burton maritime museum which of course was part of her legislation to have that funded properly and the gentleman from arizona mr mo udall did change the name in the legislation naming it after her one of the things that i would like to suggest i have introduced a bill that would allow the staff and people who work on the hill to have access to a daycare center and that has been passed i think that it would really be an honor for me to know that my legislation somehowand the gentlewoman from colorado mrs pat schroeder is the one who suggested it and i think it is a great ideato somehow dedicate that daycare center to the memory of our friend sala burton so we accept her death in the sense of alfred lord tennyson when he recalled in his wonderful poem in memoriam when he had the death of one of his dear friends thrust upon him and he was wondering how he could accept this great tragedy one of the lines that he uttered then and which is recorded for all of us immortally is something that consoles me very much when i think of her and that is ris better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all we all loved sala burton and we will talk to her many many times"],

upon the world stage in 1941 with the nazi invasion of his homeland and in common with the ideals that finally brought the united states into that conflict he and his serbian compatriots fought to secure unto themselves and their posterity liberty and justice as commander in chief of the yugoslav army general mihailovic assumed the leadership of a movement which has grown up during the war called ravnogorstvo atop the mountain of ravna gora in serbia he was heir in this respect to a grand serbian tradition begun in the 14th century on the battlefield of kosovo when serbians bravely took up arms against the invading turks although hopelessly outnumbered on that occasion and faced with certain defeat the serbs nevertheless laid down their lives for preservation of the same ideals the serbian patriots once more defended in the face of totalitarianism in world war ii liberty and justice the serbs were the first to confront this challenge to western civilization in the 14th century five centuries later in world war i they did it again at what was called the tessalonika front driven by this same spirit general mihailovic led his peoples resistance to the hydraheaded evils of nazism and communism a generation later general mihailovic paid for his devotion to freedom with his life while he triumphed against the nazis the twin menace of communism made him one of the first martyrs of the cold war general mihailovic was betrayed because of his commitment to securing liberty and justice for his people he was the first freedom fighter to experience the treachery of defeating nazism only to be delivered up as a human sacrifice to its twin the evil of communism tragically the western world still basking in the defeat of adolph hitler turned its face in shameful disregard to the opening round of world war iii today we can tally some of the consequences of that betrayal of concern for liberty and justice by looking beyond the iron curtain to the slave states of eastern europe the battlefields of nicaragua afghanistan angola mozambique and cambodia and the systematic genocide prepetrated by the marxist dictator of ethiopia there is a symbolism to mihailovics birthdate of march 27 on that very day in 1941 the serbs supported the military coup that occurred in yugoslavia it was clear to the serbs at that time as it was to that portion of the royal army loyal to freedom that war was preferable to a pact with the nazis at that same time the central committee of the minor communist party of yugoslaviaobeying stalins directivehad strenuously urged support for the pact with the nazis in fact they claimed the people were quite willing to surrender their freedom to avoid war but the serbian officers of the regular yugoslav army reflecting the antitotalitarian spirit of the serbian people turned down a nonaggression pact with the axis powers this in turn resulted in the crucial delay of hitlers invasion of the soviet union that ultimately cost him a victory in that campaign yet these same antinazi officers were denounced by the communists as war criminals perhaps more significant was the fact that on this day the birthday of draza mihailovic the battle lines were drawn in yugoslavia between serbs and communists that have persisted to this day just a few years earlier the man called titowho would later murder general mihailovicpublished two manifestos in the swedish communist newspaper that praised the nazi and soviet occupation of the three baltic states one of the tragic ironies of the war was that the nazi sympathizer josip broz tito was cosseted by the allies at the expense of the true allied patriot mihailovic because of communist penetration of british intelligence during the war the yugoslav royal army ended up being defeated from within what the nazis had been unable to accomplish in the battlefield yugoslav communists achieved from within on april 6 1941 germany invaded yugoslavia four days later at the plenum of the central committee of the communist party of yugoslavia held in zagreb the yugoslav communists welcomed the german invaders they held great britain to be an enemy and expressed the opinion that war against germany was unnecessary and repugnant in spite of this disloyalty to the country their colonel mihailovic leading the combined unit of the royal army refused to accept capitulation rapidly his determined resistance grew in a matter of weeks his original unit became a wellorganized army behind the enemy lines the outpouring of support for his efforts on the part of serbs was unselfish and spontaneous the underground grew in belgrade and in all the cities and towns of serbia led by mihailovic the serbs were the only force in europe fighting the superior nazi forces other than the british at this point it is important to review some history surrounding events that are clouded in memory or virtually unknown to a postwar generation national socialism and communism were ideological cousins to be sure there were theoretical differences and they had intramural quarrels but their common enemy free societies enabled them to overlook their differences thus in their mutual quest for world domination the alliance between hitler and stalin to doubleteam poland was a natural but this collectivist totalitarian cooperation had existed for years throughout all of europe tito for example worked in cooperation with the nazis as far back as the spanish civil war the communists in yugoslavia who prided themselves on being the most stalinist party of europe became hitlers most dependable ally in yugoslavia after creation of the sovietnazi pact ribbentrops top intelligence agent for the balkans stated after the war that tito was our tool for this reason the balkan bureau of hitlers foreign ministry arranged for titos transit from switzerland to yugoslavia to coordinate the communists in opposition to the serbian forces which refused to accept yugoslav capitulation to the nazis until hitlers doublecross of stalin then there was tight coordination between the nazis and the yugoslav communists to bring yugoslavia into the third reich but the communist hostility toward the freedom loving serbs who bravely resisted the nazi invasion did not end once hitler and stalin became enemies tito issued an order on october 14 1941 that the liquidation of all chetnik bands is as important as the liquidation of the occupiers the yugoslav communists began a systematic attack on serbian priests distinguished citizens and even the elderly heroes from world war i who had broken the tessalonika front on october 10 1941 in the serbian town of kraqujevac the communists provoked a holocaust by killing a handful of the nazi occupiers the nazis retaliated 11 days later by mercilessly killing 7 300 male serbs including high school students on the heels of this atrocity tito declared that the yugoslav communist struggle is no longer a battle against the axis powers at stake is the future political power in the whole country in response titos communist supporters at the end of october began a fullfledged civil war in yugoslavia by massacring all of mihailovics wounded soldiers at a hospital in uzice despite these historic facts this was the very time that communist disinformation came to twist history in the minds of many until well after world war ii had ended in this respect the disinformation is not dissimilar from that engaged in by the communists today with regard to nicaragua afghanistan angola and mozambique our own state department obviously had difficulty sorting out fact from communist propaganda for it suppressed the fact until 1967 that general mihailovic had been recommended to receive this nations highest decoration for valor to a nonnational by then gen dwight eisenhower and this honor was bestowed by president harry truman on december 10 1941 the german high command in serbia in a secret report acknowledged that mihailovic had escaped a trap they had laid for him at the same time in a public declaration announced to the serbian population by radio and leaflets mihailovic was declared a criminal rebel and a reward of 200 000 dinars was posted for his head by july 6 1942 the cominterns radio free yugoslavia from moscow accused mihailovic of collaboration with the nazis eleven days after this announcement heinrich himmler cabled from hitlers headquarters in germany to his commander in yugoslavia that the basis of success in serbia and all of southeastern europe lay in the annihilation of mihailovic at whatever cost ironically at about this same time while the white house was praising the outstanding achievements of general mihailovic and his daring men the communist daily worker in new york city reported that mihailovic was a fascist and traitor in the meantime ravnogorstvo was bleeding unselfishly in behalf of liberti and justice for all during this time the target of the yugoslav communists was not to contribute to the allied victory in europe but to capture general mihailovic and his supreme command the objective of this emphasis was to terminate the serbian national structure simultaneously mihailovics military political and economic intelligence contributed to the allied cause for example it was mihailovics intelligence that first informed the allies about the existence of the vi bombs which were targeted on london by contrast according to the yugoslav author milovan djilas the radio link between the communist intelligence and german military intelligence was fully operational to the last day of the war the yugoslav communists joined forces with the nazi invaders in a combined effort to annihilate the mihailovic forces and this objective became an allconsuming passion mihailovic and his forces and supporters must be annihilated at any cost announced gen paul bader commandant of serbia for the nazis just 2 days before this radio free yugoslavia from moscow was trumpeting the fact that tito had charged mihailovic with treason against the communists during this same time january 1943 mihailovic had successfully tied up three german and six bulgarian divisions one can document endless cases of the treasonous relationship between the nazis and titos communist forces that culminated in the elevation of tito to power at the end of world war ii and the cruel assassination of general mihailovic but as shakespeare wrote the past is prologue at this moment in history we can publicly honor this betrayed patriot in the fight for liberty and justice he waged so well in war and had stolen from himself and the serbian people in peace but no eulogy to draza mihailovic is complete without a final word on his commitment that comes home forcefully to all americans at the same time he was being betrayed by yugoslav communists and at the same time he was abandoned by the allies thanks in large measure to disinformation provided by communist moles in the british intelligence network he kept the faith and he saved the lives of over 500 downed american airmen today after communist misrule has reduced the richest country of the balkans to an economic political and moral basket case we must not forget the enduring mihailovic legacy mihailovic lives in the hearts and minds of people in serbia today and also in the hearts and minds of freedom loving people everywhere as a symbol of the indomitable spirit of man to fight against all odds in behalf of the enduring noble ideals of liberty and justice so as we honor today the birth and life of this great man and those serbian patriots who paid the last full measure of devotion in behalf of our heritage of freedom please join me in a moment of silent prayer that his legacy will remain forever unquenchable so help us god h t571 i yield to the distinguished colleague of serbian extraction from the great state of maryland the honorable"],

to the attention of the members relative to the tremendous importance of this legislation and what we will be doing in the 100th congress on this issue it is not an overstatement to say that this bill may very well turn out to be one of the half dozen most important acts that will be considered and passed upon and perhaps adopted by the 100th congress the reason i make this statement i for this legislation is quite simple we americans are witnessing a tragic epidemic in this country we are going to s lose more of our young men to this o tragic disease by 1991 than this nation t lost in all of world war ii in the cate gory of killed in action a little less than 300 000 people that is a tragic a loss of life i even more tragic is the failure of a certain public health officials to 3 pursue steps that historically our socie ety has pursued to control communicable disease that has come into our culture failure is the only work to give to this lack of action on the part of such people as surgeon general koop dr windom the assistant secretary of health under dr bowen head of hiis and dr james mason head of the cdc in atlanta ga and along with certain public health officials in some of the major cities of america i am talking now about new york san francisco and los angeles ti reason that i mention san francisco new york and los angeles is quite simple those three cities come close to representing about half the aids cases in america indeed those two states new york and california present about half the cases in the country and the citizens of those states my state of california for instance and the citizens of the state of new york and all of us in america have watched with puzzlement bewilderment and sadness at the public health officials that i have described who have backed away from pursuing the routine step that historically has been pursued in our society to control any communicable disease that is the concept the cornerstone the foundation stane of reportability for those who have the sickness or the disease to public health authorities and in confidence contact tracing takes place our society has had a procedure in place for controlling venereal disease communicable for as long as public health authorities have been in existence i think i can contrast how the system has worked very simply with this brief metaphor today in the united states if a physician finds a patient with a curable venereal disease like syphilis or gonorrhea that doctor is required by law to report the name address and telephone number of that patient to public health authorities and contact tracing takes place on the other hand if that same doctor finds a patient with a noncurable venereal disease like the virus for aids in most states of the union there is no requirement that such a person be reported to public health authorities and in my state of california there is such an absurdity on the books called a b 403 adopted in march 1985 that if a doctor would report a patient with a noncurable venereal disease like the virus for aids in california the doctor would commit a crime in california the law is that if the doctor finds a patient with a curable venereal disease like syphilis or gonorrhea the doctor is required to report that patient to public health and contact tracing takes place but if the same doctor finds a patient with a noncurable disease like the virus for aids not only in it not reportable but as i indicated if the doctor would report it the doctor would commit a crime september 14 1988 people cannot believe that the law would be in such an absurd posture when i describe it to them as i have juit done in fact they have talked with me after speeches around the stte and in the country saying congressman that cannot be how could it possibly develop that we would mandate the reportability of a curable venereal disease and make it a crime to mandate the reportability of a noncurable venereal discase what it going on very simply we americans are looking at the first politically protected disease in the history of the country the three high officials whom i have described dr koop dr windom and dr mason have temporized on this issue on occasions they have said they support reportability for those who are hiv positive to public health authorities on other occasions they have talked out of the other side of their mouth they have not spoken with the clearness vigor dedication and commitment that our nation should be pursuing this policy at every state in the union without equivocation and as i have indicated the health officer of the state of new york is not pursuing this policy nor is the health officer in the state of california pursuing this policy that is reportability for those who are hiv positive to public health authorities in confidence and then contact tracing would take place to the credit of a significant number of the subdivisions of the medical association of the state of new york those good physicians in those subdivisions have filed a suit against the health officer of the state of new york to compel him to exercise his discretion dr axelrod to add persons who are hiv positive to public health officials in confidence so that contact tracing can take place and we would have a step taken to diminish the transferability of this fatal disease to other persons i commend those physicians in new york state for having filed that lawsuit and wish them success in the court system against dr axelrod similarly in california we californians have placed an issue on the ballot called proposition 102 that would permit the voters of california to decide whether or not we want to reverse this absurd law a b 403 that was adopted in march of 1985 and establish a public health response to the aids epidemic rather than a civil rights response we in the house in consideration of h r 5142 will have an opportunity for voting on an amendment that will mandate reportability of those who are hiv positive to public health authorities in confidence some of my colleagues have from time to time objected and said congressman dannemeyerl we should not be treading on states rights we should let the states decide whether or not they want to have as a policy the issue of reportability for people who are hiv positive and i have to admit that there is a certain credibility to the argument of states rights i have supported it on many occasions in this body but given the magnitude of the problem we americans are facing the numbers of hundreds of thousands of people who are going to die in this country and the tremendous expenditure of health care dollars in the bills to care for these people of this tragic disease we are looking we are staring in the face a major health crisis in america and i do not believe it makes sound policy for us to say to the legislatures of the states of this union that we will let them determine on this major epidemic facing the american people whether or not they want to have reportability for those who are hiv positive the reason i say that is because for us to pursue that policy of letting the states have the option is not unlike having pursued the policy in world war ii which fortunately we did not but the comparison is appropriate that if we had said to the governors of the states of the union that they had the authority to decide whether they wanted to send their sons to defend the federal government in world war ii i do not think that would have been a credible policy with which to pursue world war ii similarly for the nation today given the magnitude of this problem to permit the states to determine whether or not they want to have persons who are hiv positive in their states reportable to public health when they present cases of the virus is not what i would believe to be a good public health response let me recite to my colleagues some of the authorities who have advocated that this person pursue a national policy of reportability for those who are hiv positive the presidents commission in its final report recommended that identity link test results be reported to public health authorities in confidence so that public health officials may pursue partner notification in june of this year the american medical association called on states to trace the sexual partners of people infected with the aids virus i think that contact tracing has the potential to substantially reduce the proliferation and spread of aids said dr gene salmons executive vice president of the 295 000member ama the medical society of the state of new york recommended in february that new york state policy on reporting be modified so that reporting would be confidential but not anonymous individuals who are found to be scropositive for the aids virus would be reported to public health authorities on a confidential basis with enough information to be epidemiologically significant in order to be epidemiologically significant new york state considers changing from a system of anonymity to a system of confidentiality for persons with hiv infection the medical society coneluded that the current policy of providing total anonymity to individuals testing positive is inappropriate from a scientific standpoint and has the potential to frustrate efforts to deial with aids the significance of this position for new york state and i will mention again that that state representts roughly onethird of the aids cases in america and if some good physicians in that state have finally awakened as to what course that state should be pursuing i think it is something that we in the congress should consider as well the need for the amendment that this member from california will be offering on the issue of reportability was best stated by the colorado state health department when it adopted the requirement for mandatory reporting of hivinfected individuals just 8 months after the fda approval of the elisa test and that was about in march 1985 the purpose of mandatory reporting is fourfold first to alert responsible health agencies to the presence of persons likely to be infected with a highly dangerous virus second to allow responsible health agencies to ensure that such persons are properly counseled as to the significance of their laboratory test and to advise them as to what they need to do to prevent further transmission of the virus third to allow responsible health agencies to monitor the occurrence and spread of infection of the virus in the population of colorado and fourth to allow responsible health agencies to recall persons with likely or proven cases of hiv infection when specific antiviral treatment becomes available roughly 12 states in the union now mandate reportability in some form those i2 states unfortunately compose around 10 percent of the total cases nationally colorado idaho virginia and south carolina all require reporting of hiv infections in confidence and encourage partner notification the results of their efforts are testimony 1 o the benefits of and need for reporting colorado new positives 45 total tested 296 the percent of positive 15 percent idaho new positives 23 total tested 59 percent of positive 39 percent south carolina new positives 12 total tested 68 percentage positive in percent virginia 44 new positives total tested 318 percentage positive 14 some states claim reporting will drive those most likely to be infected underground because such information in the possession of public health threatens confidentiality of test results and could result in discrimination against infected individuals dr tom vernon director of the colorado department of health reports that his state has vigorously pursued reporting and contact tracing policies since 1986 and that there have been no breaches of confidentiality and no problem with discrimination according to nancy spencer colorado state aids program manager the thing we think we are doing is preventing a person who has tested positive from transferring it to one new partner a 1987 south carolina study also suggested that tracing those who had intimate contact with people infected with aids is effective in controlling the spread of aids the south carolina study involved a rural county health department tracing the contacts of one man found to be infected with hiv investigators tested and counseled all 19 of the mans reported contacts and found additional contacts from those found to be hiv positive the investigator reported that after counseling many changed their sexual habits and the hiv positive men reduced their sexual contacts by 82 percent and uninfected men reduced their contacts by 54 percent south carolina health officials contend that behavior changes resulting from the tracing made the effort worthwhile this member from california has read a great deal of material over the last 3 years i have written some shared some of this with my colleagues and i will at this time read for the attention of my colleagues what i consider to be the most succinct analysis of the fundamental error in public health officials in america today that deals with the issue of reportability in responding to the aids epidemic this speech was given by dr david pence on november 4 1987 to 1 100 physicians and community leaders in grand rapids mi the reason i think this man pence has something to say for all of us is because not only is he a doctor an m d practicing in minnesota and i have never met him but i have talked with him on the telephone but he also has an interesting background this is what he says describing himself finally let me speak as a man of the vietnam generation the aids epidemic is our war we know how to lose a war fight without a definable strategy or objective talk about winning hearts and minds and education rather than establishing territorial dominance discourage individuals from exercising leadership by assigning every problem to a committee representing every viewpoint and then charged with developing a consensus succumb to those who protest the goals of your policy by compromising the tactics needed to attain them ask of your young men for their lives but demand nothing from the general population personally i have seen enough young men die because authorities could not decide if they should try to win a war or pack up and leave we cannot leave this warso let us fight it to win dr pence i might add marched as a civil rights activist in the south in the 1960s he exercised his conscience in the vietnam war and actually served time in the federal penitentiary for the exercise of that act of civil disobedience and yet today he is an eloquent spokesman for correcting an error in the course of where public officials in america have dealt with developing a public health response to this epideinic i would just like to read his comments at this time someone once asked g k chesterton if he believed in progress he answered that if a man begins a journey by turning down the wrong road then progress would only lead him further from his true destination chesterton much preferred the idea of reform reform implies a reliance on certain forms and standards by which to judge the merit of a particular course of action the argument which i wish to propose this evening is that in the formulation of public policy to interrupt the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv we have been turned down the wrong road for a good while now future steps in the same direction will in fact lead us further from our true destinationthe control of the aids epidemic a true reform of these policies will indeed necessitate a return to certain traditional standards and forms by which we can judge our efforts the standards which will form the basis of our strategy are to be found in the basic tenets of our political philosophy a reform of present policies must be based on the application of traditional public health measures formulated over the past century to prevent the transmission of incurable infectious diseases we should note that while hiv is a new phenomenon the applicable principles of public health policy were formulated long before anyone had ever heard of the aids epidemic while aids is certainly a medical problem the pivotal institutions which must contain the epidemic are local and state governments it will be local communities acting through our political institutions which will coordinate both the educational and enforcement measures needed to prevent transmission of the hiv while aids is a national and global epidemic the measures needed to prevent its spread will depend on the prevalence of the virus in a particular community while the problem of aids knows no boundaries its solution lies in the exercise of public health enforcement and policing functions which by their nature are limited to local territorial jurisdictions it is this fact which presents us with the firt great paradox of the aids debate the communities which have the highest incidence of the disease have been the most reluctant to apply stringent public health measures to prevent the transmission of the disease this is largely a consequences of the lobbying efforts of gay special interest groups who have used the aids epidemic to further their own ideological agenda it is certainly no coincidence that the communities which have the highest incidence of the hiv are also the most susceptible to the alteration of public policy by the pressure of the gay lobby an early error in the establishment of aids task forces was the mistaken belief that public policy could be formulated by achieving consensus between gay activists public health officials and clinical physicians surveying present policies in most states we must conclude that to achieve consensus with gay activists public pollcymakers have stripped themselves of the traditional armamentarlum of public health agencies in fact the second great paradox of the aids debate is been the labeling of legitimate concerns of health care workers parents physicians and political leaders as aids hysteria individuals who have advocated traditional public health measures have been derided as fascistic right wing and homophoblc these personal slurs have silenced many medical professionals from entering the aids debate because they are unaccustomed to such vitriolic personal attacks corrupting civil discourse meanwhile the wildest fantasies of governmental conspiracy and persecution have been accepted as a rationale for limiting public health officials in exercising their legitimate surveillance and enforcement roles in

organizations which represent farmworkers throughout the united states incuding the farmworkers justice fund the national council of la raza the association of farmworker opportunity programs and the unitedstates catholic conference the united farmworkers of california and texas the farm labor organizing committee of ohio and michigan the east coast farmworkers support network the american friends service committee and cata which represents puerto rican farmworkers in the united states the legislation before us today is intended to assist the victims of drought who are suffering economically as a result of agricultural losses this is a national calamity and it deserves a national response from the congress we need to respond to the economic needs of farmers and those in farmrelated businesses but let us not in our haste ignore the urgent needs of the most vulnerable drought victims americas farmworkers across this nation in ohio in michigan in the farm belt in the southwest there are thousands of homeless jobless and stranded farmworkersmany of them childrenwho are special drought victims they cant lose their farms they own no farms they cant lose their housing they have no housing they cant lose their unemployment benefits and their health care coverage they have none and in addition to homelessness and destitution they face another urgent crisis malnutrition that is something we can do something about today in this legislation that is what this amendment is about this special plight of farmworkers may sound familiar because the congress in 1982 enacted special rules to expedite the processing of food stamp benefits to migrant farmworkers but the reagan administration issued regulations last fall which severely underminded that law leaving thousands of farmworkers stranded without the ability to secure the food stamps they and their children desperately require and for which they are eligible those regulations say that vendor paymentslike emergency housing for destitute farmworkerscount as income and can deprive them of eligibility for food stamps as a result thousands of farmworkers must choose shall they endure homelessness to qualify for food stamps or nutritional deprivation in return for temporary shelter is that what this congress intended is that justice for farmworkers i am reminded of the proposed regulations by the reagan administration to deny supplemental security income benefits to the elderly who own a car or their home those regulations were withdrawn because of protests from elderly groups and their supporters in the congress i remember the refusal of the reagan administration year after year to require sanitation facilities and clean drinking water for farmworkers finally the courts and congress rose up to demand that the rules finally be issued i recall the proposal of governor reagan to reduce food stamp allocations to a pregnant woman because she was providing housing for her baby the courts threw out that twisted logic now in 1988 the reagan administration tells us that the poor family of a migrant worker must choose beween rudimentary housing and food between homelessness and starvation is it possible that we are describing america in 1988 sadly it is all time this amendment will restore the original intent of the congress action in 1982 by excluding emergency housing assistance to destitute migrant and seasonal farmworkers such as housing from designation as food stamp income and it should also be noted that under the law such emergency allocations as fuel car repairs and transportation home must be excluded as well this amendment deserves the support of every member in this chamber this amendment will also assure that migrant farmworkers will receive food stamps for their entire month in which they apply with any overpayments being subsequently deducted this will assure that a destitute farmworker family is able to buy necessary food immediately rather than await the start of a new month throughout this country there may be 50 000 farmworkers or more who are stranded by drought without crops to pick and therefore without an ability to support themselves or to return to their homes i want to commend chairman de la garza for taking the initiative of writing to secretary of labor mclaughlin requesting that she utilize the national activities account to direct emergency transportation and financial support to farmworkers and i call on secretary mclaughlin to act immediately if anyone doubts the emergency nature of this amendment or its appropriateness to the drought relief bill let us recall this fact a field which is not harvested this year will spring back again with next years rain a farmworker family decimated by impoverishment a child deprived of adequate nutrition a pregnant mother denied basic foodsthese drought victims cannot recover with a rainfall they will bear the scars of the drought of 1988 for a lifetime for amelia chavez a single mother of two stranded in liberty center oh for the six members of aurora ruiz family in texas rio grande valley for frank mcqueen a migrant fruit picker in the midwestfor these drought victims who have no voice to speak for them except this congress let us pass this amendment even in good times these farmworkerswho pick the crops and provide all of us with our foodlive close to poverty and despair now when the skies are clear and the fields are dry can we in good conscience tolerate any obstacles which prevent them from receiving the food assistance they so desperately need and which

yield further to interject the fact that nobody knows in his country how many people have the virus the reason that we do not know is because we have not been reporting those with the virus to publichealth authorities as routinely we should have been at least the last 3 or 4 years and because we do not know may 119 1987 may 11 1987 co we make estimates the estimates are between 1 and 4 million people take your pick a year ago public health authorities would tell us that of those with the virus 20 percent would go to develop aidsand die today the current estimate is 50 to 60 percent and some researchers are saying that that percentage is as high as 70 to 80 percent who will get aids and die what is even more disturbing about this whole thing is that it is estimated that 90 percent of those with the virus do not know that they have it90 percent do not know that they have it i believe that it is important for all of us that those who have the virus know that they have it because i believe that a lot of people who have the virus although that is a terrifying thought to contemplate i believe that most people will act responsibly and avoid transferring bodily fluids to other humans so that they do not transfer that fatal virus to another human but right now our society has not even mustered the political courage to say as a matter of law that any person with the virus with knowledge of that fact who knowingly transfers the virus to another human through a transfer of bodily fluids commits a crime or a criminal offense i believe that we should say that as a matter of statement a standard that we ask our citizens to observe we have not done that yet and i will draw the contrast to california my state again in california we have a law which says that if you have a venereal diseasewhich has been on the books since 1957if you have knowledge of that fact when it is in an infectious state you commit a criminal offense to have sexual relationsthat is if you have syphilis or gonorrhea those two are among the six defined as venereal diseases would you believe that in march of 1983 when the chief health officer of california added those with aids to the list of reportable diseases that health officer did not recommend to the legislature that we modify the definition of venereal disease to include aids so get this if you have a curable communicable venereal disease in california it is a crime for you to have sexual relations with another human if on the other hand you have a noncurable communicable venereal disease such as the virus for aids or even aids there is no proscription on your conduct at all i believe that when the public figures this out they are going to be outraged at this irresponsibility on the part of our public health officials becausei will say this again i think because it needs saying that a lot of us believe that if 73 percent of the people in this country who have the virus for aids had gray eyes or brown eyes a group of highly disorganized people in america our public health officials would probably have quarantined that group 2 years ago but because 73 percent of the aids cases come from one specialinterest group in america male homosexuals that group has been successful in intimidating public health officials from taking the action that they routinely normally have taken to control

the needs of children one of the federal governments biggest success stories in its service to children is the head start program i know most of my colleagues are familiar with head start it was originally designed as an 8week summer project under the economic opportunity act it has proved to be one of the most popular effective and enduringof the 1960s antipoverty programs today head start continues to provide comprehensive services to address the health nutrition social and educational needs of some of the nations poorest children and their families at least 90 percent of the children head start serves must be from lowincome families the program also has a mandate to address the special needs of handicapped migrant and indian preschoolers over 91 million children and their families have enjoyed the benefits of head start since the programs inception head start gives disadvantaged children a better chance as they enter school children who have participated in head start and other preschool programs are less likely to require special or remedial education and are more likely to be in the correct grade level for their age a followup of 820 head start children showed gains in school performance lasting as long as 13 years the program also helps parents become more actively involved in their childrens education and development four out of five head start parents offer volunteer services and onethird of all head start staff are parents of current and former students head start has helped to focus the attention of the nation on the importance of early childhood development it has served as a model for many other public private state and local preschool programs and childcare services research has proved that quality preschool programs are a very wise investment not only in terms of developmental gains for children but also in savings to taxpayers the high scope foundations perry preschool study found that the total economic benefits of 1 year of preschool outweigh the costs by 7 to 1 preschool graduates have higher rates of high school graduation and employment and lower rates of arrest and teen pregnancy than their nonpreschool peers i would like to share with you an example of the kind of positive changes head start can effect in the lives of families mrs frankie king a head start parent from auburn al testified at my subcomittees oversight hearing during the 99th congress when her children began participating in head start nearly 20 years ago mrs king had not finished high school she now not only has her ged but a college diploma too she also has moved up the head start employment ladder from volunteer to parent involvement coordinator three of mrs kings six children participated in head start all six have finished college her youngest sona former head startergraduated with honors from the university of florida got a scholarship to the sorbonne to study french and at the time of our hearing was serving as a volunteer teacher with the peace corps in morocco so beyond the educational skills and the social skills and the health screening head start builds confidence nothing hurts a childs selfesteem more than continued failure head start gives a child a chance to succeed not only intellectually but also emotionally if a child is helped to understand his or her dignity that child is more likely to respect the dignity and worth of othersand all society is made safer for many children head start is the first step in their journey toward this understanding and toward selfrespect we have to put more children on that path head start is currently serving only 16 percent of eligible children over 2v million more remain in need last september the congress overwhelmingly approved legislation which i introduced to reauthorize head start through fiscal year 1990 i would urge my colleagues to continue their strong support for head start it is the responsibility of the government to promote

the hypothetical case that the sanlnista national liberation front fslnj lost an election the fsln would hand over government not power daniel oretga the new york times december 13 1987 the reason for outlining those statements is to show that the sandinistas are firmly committed to communism no communist government in the history of the world has ever agreed to convert to a democratic form of government yet that is what the sandinistas are asking us to believe they will do now we should be extremely skeptical of the sandinistas intentions in order to protect our own national security interests to help keep other central american governments from being subverted by communism and to help the people of nicaragua who do not want to live under a communist regime if the cnntras are defunded and killedoff the united states and her allies will depend upon soviet cuban and nicaraguan goodwill our insurance and deterrence of further communist expansion will no longer be the nicaraguan resistance but the military of the united states of america i do not think this is wise especially when nicaraguans are now willing to fight their own battles can the sandinista communists be trusted to democratize nicaragua perhaps another question should be asked instead why did they not democratize nicaragua when they came to power 9 years ago when president carter delivered economic aid to what was then billed as a free and democratic movement the reason is that the sandinistas decoived the world about their intentions then and they are deceiving the world now by playing games

to the point where they may be able to break with the past a past market by repression cruelty and corruption after the downfall of duvalier the people of the united states proved their willingness to help the haitian people in their struggle for economic development and social justice today we stand ready to help again once we know that the hand of tyranny has again been truly thrown off and we are certain that the will of the haitian people will not again be thwarted make no mistake about it this congress likes what it hears general avril saying with the support of the noncommissioned officers and the haitian army general avril and those supporting him have stated their desire to return haiti to the path toward democracy he has reached out beyond the army to involve the opposition leadership and other key groups in a national dialog and that is an important step toward national reconciliation we like what has been done with the removal from office some of the most notorious defenders of the old order determined to halt a transition to democracy the last few weeks have seemingly brought about an almost unbelievable transformation where there was despair there now is hope but we in the united states have learned through harsh experience that the performance of haitis leaders seldom has reflected their democratic rhetoric while we hope and pray that the apparent alignment of the haitian army with the desires of the haitian people will bring a new day united states policy must be based on reality and not expectations if we are to again provide large amounts of assistance to haiti it must be on the basis of haitian government performance toward achieving the goals of liberty justice and prosperity laid down by the haitian people in the constitution they approved overwhelmingly in 1987 general avril has spoken well of democracy but without free open and fair elections there is no democracy it is to be hoped that the new government of haiti will promptly set a date for elections in the not too distant future and that it will establish an electoral process that will have the respect and support of the haitian people the concurrent resolution before us today is offered neither in a spirit of concession or confrontation the resolution sets forth clearly and simply the sense of congress with respect to those goals to which we deem the haitian government must be committed if in behalf of the american people the congress is ever to approve providing assistance to the haitian government today no such assistance is provided it is forbidden by the appropriations law just enacted while assistance to the haitian people continues through private voluntary organizations this resolution would make explicit the intent of congress that aid to the haitian government not be resumed until and unless the government of haiti has taken clear and decisive actions to acheive certain specified goals these are not washingtons goals but goals repeatedly called for by the haitian people themselves what are the steps we expect the haitian government to take to embark on a credible transition to democracy based on the 1937 constitution and announcement of an election date to respect human and civil rights to reform the corrupt bureaucracy to promote economic development and to assure the personal security and right to assembly essential to grassroots development to step up cooperation with us on narcotics trafficking and to demonstrate the militarys willingness to accept civilian rule and to abide by haitis constitution section 2 of the resolution provides that it is further the sense of congress that we not have a regular and sustained assistance relationship with the government until a civilian government has been elected through free and open elections and further provides that no assistance should be given until after there have been full consultations with the congress by the executive branch sectioti 3 of the resolution declares congress support for the aspirations of the haitian people for an elected civilian government and for economic government and urges appropriate committees of congress to take whatever actions they deem appropriate to promote free elections either through positive steps such as assistance or through the enactment of economic sanctions such as those now pending in h r 4152 if progress is not made toward free elections section 4 of the resolution calls on the executive branch to work with our friends and allies to shape a multilateral policy toward haiti this resolution

values shared by the haitian and american peoples i am confident that if progress in haiti is reflected by concrete actions the congress will give high priority next year to reviewing existing aid

ballot before the results of an election are announced seeking a way to do that the committee on house administration and the committee on energy and commerce held numerous hearings around the country over the last several years what we found was the the problem of early projections of election returns had two parts and therefore that any solution would also have to be a two part solution the first part of the problem was new in 1980 that was the network use of exit polls to make their election projections exit polls are interviews with voters as they leave the voting booth they have been around for several election cycles and have been used to provide accurate postelection information on voting patterns what was new in 1980 was the use of that data to predict the outcome of the election while voting was still going on eliminating that part of the problem turned out to be difficult any attempt to legislate restrictions on the television networks immediately becomes tangled in arguments over the first amendments rights of the press so we moved instead to exert public pressure on the networks to voluntarily refrain from announcing election results before polls are closed pressure came from many quarters including a congressional resolution that was passed overwhelmingly in 1984 calling on the networks to exercise voluntary restraint parenthetically it is interesting to note the pressure also came from within the news business even from some within the newsrooms themselves who seriously questioned the journalistic propriety of making news by predicting events before they occur early in 1985 that effort paid off we achieved a major breakthrough when the three television networks joined with westinghouse broadcasting and with turner broadcasting and agreed that they will not use their exit polling data to make election projections until the polls in a state are closed that agreement solved half the problembut not all of it the second part of the problem we found is simply that this is a large country spanning several time zones made up of states with widely varying poll closing times therefore polls in some parts of the country are closed hours before polls in other parts of the country furthermore we have a winnertakeall electoral college system in short it is quite possible for actual vote totals from places where polls are closed to reveal the outcome of an election while polls elsewhere are still open only a nationwide uniform poll closing time can prevent that from happening the senate first recognized this situation in the md1970s they passed uniform poll closing proposals on several different occasions unfortunately at that time the house did not act and when the problem was compounded in 1980 with the advent of projections based on exit polls we had to go back and solve the exit polling part of the problem first having done that we are once again to the point where a uniform poll closing time will finally and completely eliminate having the outcome of an election determined and announced before people in all parts of the country have had an opportunity to vote two years ago we set to work on this second part of our solution a uniform poll closing time the bills before us included sunday voting 24hour voting directing the federal election commission to select a poll closing time closing the polls at 11 e s t and closing the polls at 10 30 e s t we talked to secretaries of state local election officials political party people representatives of citizens groups and unions members of the house and local broadcasters by the conclusion of the hearings a general consensus had developed with respect to several potential aspects of a uniform poll closing proposal first election day should remain on tuesday second there was widespread agreement that any bill should apply exclusively to the presidential general election day not to other federal elections third any bill should address poll closing times only not poll openings states should be free to keep or alter their opening times as they see fit finally with respect to the actual poll closing time the hearings suggested that while a closing later than 9 could be difficult for election officials to administer a 9 closing in the eastwhich already exists in several stateswould be reasonable for the pacific time zone however the comparable poll closing of 6 is too early the poll closing time there cannot realistically be earlier than 7 local time what we had then was that in the eastwhere we were pleased that we found widespread willingness to contribute to a solutionelection officials felt they could administer a 9 closing but they made cogent arguments about the difficulties of a later time people in the west were willing to close their polls an hour earlier at 7 local time but felt that an earlier closing would have a detrimental effect on voter turnout since there is a difference of only 2 hours between 7 in the west and 9 in the east while the actual time difference between east and west is 3 hours we needed a way to eliminate an hour of time difference after weighing all the information data suggestions and ideas from our hearings the committee adopted a proposal put forward by the secretary of state of massachusetts and the secretary of state of california it is exactly the proposal currently included in h r 435 i should note that this proposal does not include alaska and hawaii since the only way to integrate them would be to have a much later closing in the eastern time zone we talked to people from both those states and they graciously agreed to remain outside a nationwide closing time that means the problem of early projections in those states will not be solvedbut it will be mitigated substantially under the plan now in h r 435 two things will happen first polls will close at 9 eastern standard timewhich is 8 c s t and 7 m s t second in the pacific time zone in presidential election years only in order to achieve a 7 poll closing daylight saving time will be extended for 2 weeks in four and onehalf states in the pacific time zone since 7 pacific daylight time is the same as 9 eastern standard time uniformity is achieved this proposal commended itself to the committee for a number of reasons among them are it achieves uniformity so all polls will close simultaneously on presidential election day it does so while keeping poll closing times within the limits9 in the east and 7 in the westthat election officials are confident they can administer effectively no state will be required to close its polls either later9 local timeor earlier7 local timethan many states now do similarly no state will be required to have a voting day either longer15 hoursor shorterl hoursthan some states now do more than onefourth of the states will not have to change their poll closing hours at all states that will be required to extend their closing hours will be extending them by less than under any other proposal and if they choose to adjust their opening times as they have complete authority to do the amount of change can be further reduced or eliminated altogether this is the proposal that passed the house last year with the addition of an amendment that will allow earlier closing times in a handful of precincts in one or two states when every eligible voter has voted unfortunately the bill was not acted on in the senate it died there at the end of last session we hope for a better result this time around to summarize since 1980 this committee has been assembling the pieces of a plan that will once again ensure at least a minimum degree of protection for election day the final step necessary to complete the plan is to have the voting process finish simultaneously across the country this bill h r 435 is that final stepthe one piece necessary to complete the solution this particular proposal has merit because of all those examined by the committee it is the least intrusivethe one that is least disruptive of the fragile process of administering elections in the tens of thousands of jurisdictions across the country responsible for the difficult expensive crucial remarkable work of conducting our elections year after year our country is so large and there is so much variety among the states in how they conduct elections that going into the hearings few members of the committee believed a solution could be found in which fully threefourths of the states would change by a maximum of 1 hour and in which no state will be required to do anything that is not already being done in other states and yet while this proposal makes modest changes in most states it is a complete solution one that will achieve uniformity one that will solve the problem i commend h r 435 to the house and urge all my colleagues to support it i am happy to yield such time as he may consume to the chairman of the committee on

wisconsin the amendment would emasculate the title ix prohibition against sex discrimination in a federally funded education program by exempting hundreds possibly thousands of schools from compliance with this nondiscrimination duty in addition it would severely weaken the application of all four laws to private entities operating federally funded programs if this amendment is adopted the federal government will find itself in the march 2 1 988 untenable position of providing federal assistance to programs that discriminate against minorities women the handicapped and the elderly the amendment opens up a giant loophole in the existing title ix religious tenet exemption since its enactment in 1972 title ix has permitted very narrow exceptions from the prohibition against genderbased discrimination in any federally funded education program one of the exceptions is available to an educational institution if it is controlled by a religious organization and there is a title ix requirement which conflicts with the religious tenets of that organization since this bill was introduced in 1985 supporters cf this loophole amendment have argued that such a change is necessary because otherwise these institutions which they claim are no longer religiously controlled will have to pay for or perform abortions they can no longer make that claim in light of the danforth amendment now at last they must confess their true motives which is they simply want to be exempt from title ix coverage in fact they have lobbied for this change each time title ix has been amended congress in its wisdom has rejected this effort during consideration of this bill a few weeks ago the senate rejected their claim by a vote of 56 to 39 the house refused to accept this proposal during floor consideration of the restoration bill in virtually every private school can establish some affiliation with a religious organization adoption of such a loophole would defeat the purpose of title ix not only is such a proposal unacceptable on policy grounds it is also unnecessary proponents of this amendment cannot cite a single instance in which legitimate exemptions have been denied it is critical that the control test remain in effect and enforced seriouslyfor that aspect of the test is the linchpin for assuring that only a limited number of institutions may discriminate with federal funds the proposed change to the corporate coverage section in s 557 is unacceptable and unwarranted the corporate coerage provision in the bill represents an accommodation which democratic supporters in the house made to our republican colleagues in the judiciary and education and labor committees during consideration of this bill in the 99th congress we agreed to abide by this compromise and convinced senate supporters to do the same when the bill was introduced in the 100th congress last year the corporate coverage in the bill is a compromise in that the record presented to the congress supported corporatewide coverage in all instances the compromise provides for corporatewide coverage in only two instances first when federal financial assistance is extended to the corporation as a whole or second when the corporation is principally engaged in five business areaseducation health care housing social services or parks and recreationservices which in the past have been provided by the government but through increased privatization are likely to be available through the private sector adoption of this amendment is likely to encourage entities to create discriminatory schemes which will go unchecked by federal civil rights enforces for example under the gentlemans substitute a nursing home chain could create racially segregated facilities free from federal review by confining all medicaid recipients to one or some of the facilities rather than throughout the chain we should not encourage the development of such creative techniques to avoid compliance with these

been made one of the previous speakers the gentleman from wisconsin said that it is no wonder that people do not go to the polls and vote when they see action like this i would suggest that perhaps one of the reasons people do not go to the polls and vote is because voters are being told so many things by some members of this body that just are not so i would suggest that the gentleman from nebraska has just accurately summarized what is and is not at stake on this issue let me make matters clear first of all the gentleman from wisconsin indicated that this rule is here because it was brought here by the democrat leadership bending the rules the fact is that this bill is here at the request of thedemocratic and republican leadership it is here at the request of myself among a good many other people because we are trying to support a compromise with a republican administration even though i myself have strong doubts about that compromise this is a body in which you have to try to have 535 men and women work their will in a united way and in a way which does not make the united states look silly in the process that is what we are trying to do by supporting the

a vote on authorizing every item in the bill which is unauthorized to put that in perspective the gci proposition is about 50 million all of the other unauthorized items in this bill are about 14 billion i would say that the vote on the rule is the furthest thing possible from a vote specifically on the gci it is simply a vote on whether or not we are going to do what we have done many times in the past namely authorize legislation which has not been able to make it through the authorization process so that we can avoid a continuing resolution if members want to be on a continuing resolution if we want to be here saturday if we want to be here next week and violate our promise to the president to produce 13 appropriation bills without going to a cr then vote against the motion if you want to enable the house to meet the obligation to pass 13 appropriation bills in a timely way although we may all have disagreements about specific items in the bill then you support the motion of the committee on rules and go on and support the obey motion let me say also that the assertion was also made by the gentleman from kentucky that if members vote for this they will not be able to do anything at all about the gci for the next 6 years is the furthest thing possible from the truth we have limited oci appropriations in the obey amendment to 50 million not 70 million

the baker policy and the policies of the world bank are in some respects misguided we think that they do not specifically take into account the need for our own agriculture sector to grow and our own manufacturing sector to grow so we have limited the appropriation to 20 million below the amount requested by the administration and i have a letter here which i am sending to the secretary of the treasury today and i would invite anyone to sign it who would like to sign it with me which simply states here that future appropriations for the oci over each of the next 6 years are going to be determined to a very great extent by the manner in which the treasury department and the world bank handle this entire question of third world debt i do not believe that we ought to provide american support for any structural loan if that country is required to devote more than 20 percent of its foreign exchange to repay loans because i think that messes up their ability to buy our own products

clear position is it politics or policy when we are dealing with international trade are domestic politics more important than the need to send a clear message that we are through with politics and we want to deal with policy the answer is vote aye on the michel amendment if we are for policy and vote no and we are back to the same old game of politics"], [0.001117706298828125, 0.4988822937011719,

the fired air traffic controllers have not controlled live air traffic for more than 6 years their skills are rusty at best they are not familiar with the procedural changes in the air traffic control system the traffic volume has increased significantly since 1981 they would all have to be trained and recertified by the faa the training effort required to attempt to recertify the large number of controllers hired pursuant to h r 3396 would divert time money and human resources away from completing the training of the current work force and would hamper the orderly training of controllers already in progress as the previous speaker the gentleman from georgia the ranking republican on the subcommittee on aviation stated a gaoconducted study of working controllers and supervisors shows how many controllers and supervisors would retire if the fired controllers were rehired air traffic control system performance would decrease if current controllers and supervisors retired rather than work alongside the former strikers many of the systems most experienced controllers familiar with new procedures would neither be available to train new controllers nor to handle traffic themselves productivity and controller training would suffer last air traffic control is a profession requiring close team work coordination and cooperation the harmful impact on air traffic operations from introducing an element of discord into that system should not be ignored the concerns of the faa and its working controllers and supervisors about the adverse effect of h r 3396 should not be lightly dismissed enactment of this bill would likely cause more harm to the air traffic control system than good many have talked about the safety aspect and the near misses i would say that many of those are general aviation aircraft not under the control of controllers also with the 80percent increase in passenger boardings under deregulation with no additional runways no additional airports there is going to be a higher risk operation i urge my colleagues to vote against h r 3396"], [0.0011488497257232666, 0.49885115027427673, 1, "i rise in support of the skeltonedwards resolution this is an extremely difficult vote and i think that both sides whether pro or con have very good arguments to back their respective positions i hope that both sides take the high ground in the course of this debatethat we stick to the factsand the issues rather than pointing fingers or questioning the motives of other members the american people are not only watching what will be the final outcome of this debate they are watching how we as representatives of the peoples house conduct ourselves during the course of this debate i know that many of you have made up your minds on how you will vote today therefore i would like to address myself to the dozen or so of you who remain undecided first let me put this debate into what i think is a proper perspective because i think that is extremely important this debate is noti repeat it is not a debate on whether you are for or against the central american peace initiative there is no one that is not for peace in central america we are all for a political rather than military settlement to end the turmoil that afflicts that region the debate today is rather a question of whether we trust the sandinistas in ensuring that democracy moves forward in nicaragua thats the crux of the debatebecause without democracy in nicaragua there will be no peace in central america i went to nicaragua this past weekend i met with auxiliary bishop bosco vivas who is a member of the mediation team monitoring the direct negotiations between the sandinistas and the contras he was at the head table in costa rica representatives from the government members of the independent labor unions members of the internal opposition members of the permanent commission on human rights violetta chamorro of la presna an independent paper just back on the news stands and finally the january 22 mothers of political prisoners there is genuine hope in nicaragua from all sectors that peace will come yes all sectors but there is also a healthy degree of skepticism about why the sandinistas are at this particular time making concessions and whether these concessions will be permanent there should not be any doubt why the sandinistas are at the peace table and the reason is simply the presence of the contras if we fall to continue to support the contras today the nicaragua of tomorrow will have very little hope of achieving democracy perhaps the sandinistas will not pull back on the concessions it has made so far for the next month or twobut what about 6 months from now or next year are those of you who intend to vote against this package today saying that you trust the nicaraguan government to comply with the accord i dont believe that i need to remind you that you have been burned by the nicaraguan government before it was said by some of those who we met this weekend that if we vote this package down that there will be no hope for the people of nicaragua or for the peace process let me give you an example of why i remain somewhat skeptical of the nicaraguan government when our delegation met with officials of the government this saturday we were told that there where no political prisoners in nicaraguai repeatno political prisoners in nicaragua after we met with the government officials we met with the january 22 mothers of the political prisoners well there are political prisoners in nicaragua because the sons of these mothers the husbands the brothers languish in nicaraguan jails for months and years these mothers continue to speak out for their children despite intimidation by the government despite the threats of the turbas who incidentally taunt the mothers on a regular basis the mothers will continue to speak out because they have no other choice but if we vote down this resolution we leave those mothers and their children without any hope we leave thousands of nicaraguans without any hope i find it interesting to note that although the government said that there were no political prisoners the mothers we met with named the 14 prisons where their loved ones are held all of them full when the sandinistas went to power 9 years ago there were only two prisons finally let me specifically address the issue of another vote on an alternative package how many of you believe that voting on this issue a month from now is going to be any less difficult than it is today i can answer thatit wont be if a consensus package could have been achieved between all the various factions in congress along with the consent of the administration dont you think that would have already been done i dont like voting on this issue time after time and i doubt that many of you do either but that is exactly what those who are pushing for an alternative package are asking us to do this is a very controversial issue and there is no comfort zone in which we can make a stand we must make the hard choice now all of us are concerned about the degree of cynicism by which the american public views congress if the rationale used to defeat this resolution is to defer the tough decisions for another day then the american public has a right to be cynical about this institution as do our allies and friends throughout the world i intend to support this package it is by no means perfect but it is the best chance we have in applying pressure to the sandinistas i can not look into the eyes of those mothers the young children we saw at eastey market and the men and women who have been held in prison the 14 leaders of the 14 opposition party and say we failed to keep the pressure on just when we have been seeing some modest results this package is the best chance by which we can eventually bring democracy and peace to a troubled region and that is something that we all want i hope that those of you who are still undecided will support tile skeltonedwards resolution and give democracy and peace a fighting chance in nicaragua"]]}
