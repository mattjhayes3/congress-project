request for an increase in his white house budget when all is said and done the appropriations committees response funds white house activities at precisely the same level they were funded in 1992 george bushs last year yet as a candidate bill clinton talked about a 25percent cut in the white house staff many anericans are wondering at current levels whether we are not paying too much already particularly in light of the continuing allegations of grave misconduct by members of the white house staff yet bill clinton the man who promised a 25percent cut tb the american people has this year proposed an 8percent increase for the white house budgetv i congratulate my colleague the kdntlelnan from florida who did not see fit to give mr clinton more money but is instead proposing that we hold him to at least some of the spending cuts that he proposed as a candidate in light of what the white house staff has been up to it seems to me they hardly deserve a raise just 18 months ago the clinton white house started out with travelgate it consisted in the firing and smearing of honest career employees in the white house for the benefit of the clintons relatives and campaign workers even the white house press corps were scandalized by such a noxious mixture of cronyism political manipulation of law enforcement and scapegoating the likes of which washington has not seen since the spoils system was first set into motion by andrew jackson all of this certainly set the tone for what we have now come to know as the prototypical clinton scandal the cornercutting the greed cronyism and above all the deceit there has been more serious misconduct by the clinton white house than travelgate but certainly nothing more contemptible than firing and smearing longtime apolitical lowlevel government workers in order to benefit the presidents cousin and his wealthiest friends no less disgraceful was the tampering with the fbi by the white house counsels office the office in which i once served as senior associate counsel to the president the white house counsel is supposed to be preeminently responsible for preventing ethical lapses by the president and senior white house officials instead it was this white house counsels office that was the very source of the scandal including flagrant qbvious misconduct by white house lawyer william kennedy who did not contact the attorney general who did not contact fbi director sessions but interfered directly in the operations of the fbi to target specific individuals yet kennedy remains in the white house two reprimands and several additional scandals later as a seemingly permanent sourceof ethical trouble for this president and the other white house staff as we all know mr kennedy like webb hubble and vince foster and hillary rodham clinton was part ofthe same law firm that represented arkansas wheeler dealers in whitewater and madison savings and loan and dozens of other transactions including the clintons own personal finances one of the most unsavory aspects of this staff arrangement is the cronyism from the first it turned the highest echelon s of the white house legal staff and the justice department into little more than the washington branch office of the kose law firm the predictable result was the president and hillary rodham clinton felt they could treat the white house lawyers as their personal lawyers bu t federal law prohibits government employees including the white house counsels office from performing private services for the president yet shortly before his death vince foster was working in his white house office in the west wing on government time at taxpayer expense at preparing the delinquent whitewater tax returns not only was this improper because it was the personal investment business of the clintons rather than official business but it also covered a period well before the clintons took office most observers who have commented on this fact have speculated on its relevance to mr fosters death as a former member of the counsels office i am at least as struck by its obvious impropriety using a fulltime government lawyer to work on the clinton familys personal business affairs is clearly improper i recall very well the extraordinary pains that for example president reagan took to ensure that none of the white house lawyers worked on his personal business his tax returns were prepared by his own private lawyers and his accountants even his blind trust which unlike the clintons was set up before his inauguration was prepared at his personal expense obviously the clinton white house does not follow the same ethical guidelines what does this mean from a budget standpoint obviously it means today in 1994 we are already paying for too much white house staff yet the size and the composition of the white house staff whose budget we are debating foday is itself another mystery the clintons have repeatedly denied requests from congress for a list of white house staff members and salary levels"], [1.3255749831131425e-09, 1.3255749831131425e-09, 0, "i do not have any idea but anyhow mr lasater was a very close friend of the presidents and was one of his big financial supporters mr lasater was known to use cocaine and distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the time he was being investigated and later indicted by the arkansas state police and the federal authorities for drug trafficking i continue to be concerned about his association president clintons with people like mr lasater and ms thomasson in the very limited hearings

hardest under this plan whether they are young middle class families middle class federal employees or middle class eldery the middle class will be hit by the btu tax which will cost the average family approximately 500 in additional taxes they will be hit with fewer jobs an estimated 400 000 to 600 000 fewer jobs throughout the country including approximately 1 600 jobs lost in my district along according to the national taxpayers union every worker and every business throughout my state and throughout this country will be hit with this new tax big this will in turn hurt our competitiveness abroad as we raise the price of doing business for every employer and producer in the united states this btu tax penalizes lower and middleincome families hurt schools and hospitals and increases our dependence on foreign oil under this tax hospitals will have to spend more or energy and less on healing schools will have to spend more money on transporting kids to school and less on educating them parents will have to spend more money getting back and forth to work less on supporting their families adding tens of thousands of dollars to school and hospital budgets will have a devastating impact on local economies and dramatically harm the physical and educational welfare of millions of individuals the affordable energy alliance estimates that had this proposed btu tax been fully implemented in 1990 virginia residents and businesses would have paid 701 4 million in additional energy taxes a tax burden this large would hit virginias economy particularly hard at a time when we have defense cutbacks hitting our area disproportionately along with millions of federal employees who will be subject to a wage freeze the national association of counties has noted that these increased federal taxes will reduce local revenues and result in the need for local governments to increase property taxes sales taxes and service fees at a time when local governments are still experiencing the adverse effects of the recession again the middle class will be hit the hardest the elderly on fixed incomes are also hit hard under this clinton plan the democrat plan promises to raise taxes on seniors making as late as 25 000 and while the energy tax is indexed the income level at which social security benefits will be taxed at a higher level is not indexed so millions of seniors will graduate into this new tax bracket each year and this increased tax in a breach of trust with the american people will not be returned to the social security trust fund but will instead be diverted into the general revenue fund for increased government spending no country in the world has this kind of tax this tax will be very difficult to administer and will require all kinds of new regulations and regulators to enforce it this bill reserves for the treasury department the power to unilaterally change new energy tax rates expand or contract the products subject to the tax and the power to exempt certain taxpayers this means the rules on this tax can continue to be changed and businesses will be subject to ever changing rules again this will hurt competitiveness and is not fair the republican alternative to the democratic tax plan is superior in many respects and i will support it because it achieves considerable deficit reduction without the burdensome taxes which i have just described my republican colleagues who helped fashion this plan did so under considerable time restrictions and have made many tough decisions in crafting this plan the kasich plan will reduce the budget deficit by 352 billion yet does not increase taxes or touch social security benefits while the clinton plan places a disproportionate burden on federal and military employees and retirees the republican plan eases this heavy burden i believe the men and women who serve in the civil service and milltary should be treated fairly it is important to consider the longterm benefits of having a qualified and effective federal and military workforce and be cautious in producing shortterm savings at their expense unlike the clinton plan the republican substitute wont delay federal retirees cost of living adjustments and it wont put limits on federal employees colas or locality pay also it does not delay military retirees colas and it does not freeze military pay the way the democrat plan would do coupled with the tax increases federal and military employees and retirees would suffer more than any other segment of the population under the clinton plan the republican plan is a dramatic improvement over the tax and spend democrat budget however the republican plan has some aspects i am concerned about under the republican substitute federal employees retirement age would be increased from age 55 to 62 and nondisabled military retirees would have their colas delayed until they reach age 62 federal employees have relied to their detriment on certain promises made by their employer the federal government and these promises should be respecied no other nongovernmental entity can unilaterally alter the terms of an employment contract its illegal and wrong while the congress can change the terms of an employees employment or retirement legally it is still unfair i reiterate that the republican substitute is substantially more equitable to federal and military employees and retirees than the democrat version however if i had the opportunity to amend either version which i dont because the rules committee gagged every member of this body by only allowing one amendment on the floor today i would offer additional spending cuts to make up the difference in maintaining the federal and military employee and retirees benefits what could we possibly cut to make up the difference i suggest and many would agree that we cut funding for the superconducting super collider others concerned could find other cuts if given the opportunity under the rules plagued with dramatic cost overruns management problems and no foreign contnbutions to the projects as was promised i believe this is a project that we cant currently afford given our budget defict yesterday mr victor s rezendes director of energy and science issues resources community and economic development dmsion of the unitedstates general accounting office testified that the total estimated cost of the scc is not yet known but the projects total cost will exceed 11 billion this 11 billion is more than enough to keep our commitment to federal and military employees and retirees if this plan passes the house i would work to restore these benefits by cutting the scc all americans have a deep concern about the deficit which i share and want us to cut the deficit so our children and grandchildren dont bear the burden of our ex cess the clinton plan increases taxes increases spending and as a result the deficit will not be reduced in order to cut the deficit americans want us to cut spending

for their constituents votes after raising their taxes by 402 billion 402 billion = billion in new taxes and 74 billion in hidden taxes that they are not owning up to 402 billion their net spending cuts over 5 years are 3 billion and that includes 112 billion in defense cuts so if you take the defense cuts out that were going to take place anyhow you are actually increasing domestic spending by 109 billion you tell the american people you are going to get control of spending you are going to cut this deficit and you are increasing domestic spending 109 billion and increasing their tax 402 billion more than double the largest tax increase in unitedstates history and if that aint recessionary folks i do not know what is let me just give some information here that my democrat colleagues may not be aware of the nashville center for policy analysis says that this plan will lower capital formation in the united states by 1 8 trillion that is money that we need to have invested for plant and industry expansion that will create more jobs but no and because of this slower growth that you are going to create they estimate 1 4 million fewer jobs over the next 5 years but that is not all this economic loss is equal to more than 1 000 for every man woman and child in the country or more than 2 600 for the average household by 1998 the clinton plan will cause wage income in the united states to be 160 billion lower than it would have been that means that about every fulltime employee is going to take a 1 600 pay cut and on average workers will lose 8 in aftertax income for every dollar lost by investors this is the program you are going to present to the american people i cannot imagine that we created 21 million new jobs in the 1980s we had economic growth and here you are you are going to put 1 4 million people out of work with these huge tax increases not to mention the companies you are going to drive overseas with the btu tax increase truckers the airline industry farmers foundries every industry is going to be adversely impacted by the 15centagallon gasoline tax and fuel tax that is going to be loaded on the back of arilines yet you are going to go right ahead with it i hope you know what you are doing it certainly does not appear as though you do right now let me just give a constructive alternative that we have proposed and i hope the committee on rules will allow us to bring to the floor tomorrow and that is a freeze plus 2 percent i wish my good friend the gentleman from minnesota would listen to this part of my talk a freeze plus 2 percent if we froze at last years spending levels plus a 2percent growth over the next 5 years we could reach a balanced budget by 1998 using cbos figures as far as income is concerned if we go back to a 3percent growth in tax revenues as we have had traditionally we would actually have a surplus by the year 1998 without a tax increase i hope all my friends across this country that may be paying attention to this debate will listen the republicans have the kasich plan which is far superior to the democrat plan in that it does not increase taxes and it gets to a lower deficit figure in 5 years second we have a plan that is a 2percent above freeze that gets us to a balanced budget without a tax increase so if you do not want your taxes raised america if you want to cut the fat and waste out of government spending if you want to take a meat cleaver to government then vote for the republicans because they are the ones that are trying to do something about it they will tell you we do not have a plan we have two plans the kasich plan and the 2percent plus freeze and both of them do it without massive tax increases they tell you we need more money they tell you we need 400 billion more in taxes ten years ago we were bringing in 500 billion in tax revenue and today we are bringing in 1 2 trillion we have almost tripled the amount of taxes coming into this country in 10 years and yet they want 400 billion more is that not amazing we have almost tripled the tax revenues coming in in 10 years and they still want 400 billion more and they are still not going to reach a balanced

for the un multinational contingent to reach the rangers pinned down in support of the downed helicopter 3 it is widely reported that the armored reinforcements going into somalia were actually requested by general montgomery backin early september is this true and if so why were they denied 4 president clinton expressed concern on monday for the adequacy of the protection for unitedstates forces in somalia has the joint staff centcom or anyone else in the command chain expressed concern prior to this past weekend about inadequate available capability to protect our forces 5 what capabilities will the mechanized company with one platoon of tanks give the unitedstates forces in somalia tanks are usually very vulnerable when used in city or builtup area as they lose their standoff and mobility advantage why do we think 4 or 5 tanks will give unitedstates forces a decisive advantage 6 why where the ac1z0s operating in june out of djibouti withdrawn 7 it has been suggested that the force levels we have in somalia are on the minimal end of the scale for what is required to support continued operations given this past weekends experience do we have enough forces in somalia even after the small reinforcements on the way do we have enough forces to enjoy a decisive advantage have we moved away from the decisive force doctrine 8 who authorized the change in the employment of the unitedstates quick reaction force qr from the original concept of a garrisoned reaction capability to their current use as a daytoday military force when the tactical mission changed

post listen to this the president suggested in an interview with copley news service published yesterday that the united nations had changed its mission unwisely failed to provide military operation to back up peacekeepers and staffed the units with troops untrained for their jobs who refused to venture outside their areas and refused to take orders doesnt this sound like vintage clinton the president also referred to u n actions as if he and his u n ambassador has had no role in formulating or approving them the united states sits on the security council and can veto any risolution the clinton administration supported the resolution that established the peacekeeping effort in line with clintons campaign rhetoric of relying more on multinational institutions to address international problems when the united nations included efforts to hunt down aideed and his key aides for the murders of pakistani troope the clinton administration voted for the resolution but in the interview clinton expressed doubts about the operation he said the copley interview we were asked to come in and in effect be the police officer in this thing to start this thing going and then the u n shifted course and said we ought to stay there until nationbuilding takes place clinton said he did not want our young people in harms way in the absence of the united nations aggressively proceeding with a plant to turn this country back over to the somali or to have a longterm peacekeeping strategy that does not involve the united states but clinton made the commitment to leave the troops in somalia as part of the u n force when the mission changed the key decisonmaking point for the president at that time there was no specific date for turning the country back or any schedule for withdrawing all

goes up a little bit then herwe axre in 1990 whereit starts heading up of course these are the last years we have figures for so i cannot tell you more recently but the factof the matter is we have spent in this 30year period i believe 3 5 trillion that put us deeply in debt to alleviate poverty we have created a dependent culture that just saps up more and more of out taxpayer dollars this is resulting in broken homes and more violent crime of enormous proportions this is why we have got to have further time to really talk about this on another occasion next is births to unmarried women look at this line right here in 1960 it was about 5 percent of unmarried women who gave birth look over here in 1990 we are almost at 28 percent a fivefold increase what is happening to these children these children are emotionally deprived for the most part you saw that statistic on the 560percent increase in violent crime the fastest growing component of those violent crimes is juvenile crimes that is what we are creating by the social policies that are entirely misplaced here is the chart that illustrates the increase in welfare spending it is never enough all these trillions of dollars and we still havepeople in power in the federal government from the president on down who tell us oh we have got to spend more that is what president clinton was quoted as saying on the front page of the washington post last friday we have got to raise some more revenues and get this economy going which is totally inconsistent why so that we can spend more this is completely unbelievable then he has given us a plan and let us go back to this chart for a minute a plan which is going to add 1 trillion to the national debt cumulatively and which is going to end us up after the largest tax increase in history at the end of the clinton 5year plan with an annual budget deficit of s228 5 billion some plan the famlily we see federal taxes look at this increase in the average family with median income a family of four in 1948 paid about 2 percent of its total income to the unitedstates government in taxes the same family in 1986 paid 24 percent of its income to the unitedstates government in taxes and that figure went up where by 1990 it looks like over 25 percent now from 2 to 25 percent is a twelvefold increase a 1 200percent increase in taxes to the federal government that is truly dramatic this last chart which i think is very illustrative and maybe we can end on this note represents the federal budget deficit the annual deficit going clear back to the 1940s these are inflation adjusted now of course look at what we have during the world war ii years we have annual budget deficits one of them here looks like about 1943 we have an annual budget deficit inflation adjusted of about 680 billion this is truly staggering but look at what happens here of course during the war years this goes on then we get right to here which appears to be about 1947 you can see what it is it is about 180 billion a dramatic reduction just by way of comparison our budget deficit this year is 320 billion for the fiscal year ending september 30 we are not in world war ii under the clinton plan in 5 years we are going to go from 320 to 228 5 billion look at what happened here you go in 5 years from an enormous budget deficit here at over 500 billion and my word you are up to here where you have nearly 100 billion in surplus now can you see the chauge there it is a 600 billion change we went from deep deficit to surplus we are not in world war ii right now why can we not act more quickly why can we not eliminate these tax increases out the spending bring the economy back up by reducing the deficit reducing the regulation reducing the burdens on the family strengthening our families provide incentives for people to help themselves in the inner cities and in the suburbs and pull these families back together transmit family values make us stronger and better and make us grow faster economically that is the american dream and that is what i submit we need to examine in general detail to see just exactly how we can do it so that we can better serve

weeks 216to205 vote caused quite a stira stir many of us hoped would lead immediately to a better rule unfortunately but not surprisingly those hopes have not materialized instead of changing the rule the democrat leadership is changing the vote instead of prompt relief for the victims they get smoke and mirrors instead of receiving the message from the membership that it is a bad rule the democrat leadership apparently resorted to strongarming members and letting pressure build over the weekend to change enough votes to get their their way and their bad rule as a result today we havd essentially the same rule we defeated last week minus any fical responsibility and still inexplicably wedded to a totally unrelated provision to pay 100 stipends for 30yearold teenagers in los angeles no brave new change here same old business as usual the democrat leadership has held on like a dog with a bone to this extraneous provisioneven at the risk of delaying relief to the flood victims in the midwest it is no wonder some members and the media are openly specutating about what dealmaking is going on behind the scenes of the democrat leadership a bipartisan trio representing flood victims nonetheless recognized that our government is deeply in debt and that we have got to face the costs of flood relief in the context of our already debilitating national debt payments these members asked and answered the question of how to pay for this flood relief bileither from this years budget or nextlo avoid heaping additional debt onto our childmn and grandchildren twice they pleaded with the democrat majority on the rules committse to allow the full house to debate their ideas and twice they were turned down i think it is fair to graphically compare the 1993 flood in the mississippi river valley to the federal debt both are swallowing up our livelihood the vote on this rule cannot stop the flood but it can reduce the national debt yet one of my colleagues on the rules committee went so far in avoiding specifics of how to pay for this 3 billion bill that he told messrs penny slatrery and nussle to just go away and let us help you it is a quote almost as memorable as hello rm from the government and im here to help you we all have compassion for the flood victimsand we will help them helping people who have been hit by a natural disaster is one of our govemments greatest obligatdons but years of ignoring the costs of our actions emergency and pseudoemergency have sapped our resources administratlon spokesman leon panetta has stated that we cannot really afford to fully help these flood victims and that probably applies to other victims of other natural disasters yet to comeunless we change our patterns of spending more money than we have i am willing to cut spending in other governmont accounts to ensure that we can help the flood victims i know many of my colleagues feel the same wayand we should at least be allowed to have that debate on the

colleges and universities this bill was introduced on august 6 1993 and was approved by the natural resources committee on november 10 1993 many of the historic structures located on historically black college and university campuses are threatened and a significant effort is needed to preserve and protect them the department of the interior in cooperation with the united negro college fund has launched a project to preserve these structures in 1988 a special survey to identify candidates for inclusion in this program generated responses from 46 hbcus nominating 144 structures for consideration the department and uncf eventually selected 11 of the most historically significant and critically threatened structures on such campuses the department and uncf estimate that it will cost 20 million to preserve these particular structures and uncf has agreed to match a departmental contribution of 10 million for this purpose under the hbcu historic preservation initiative however no funds were requested or appropriated for this purpose for fiscal year 1994 h r 2921 as reported by the committee on natural resources authorizes the use of appropriations from the historic preservation fund to provide grants for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures at eligible hbcus in fiscal year 1995 a total of 20 million would be authorized 5 million of which may be used only for fisk university and 10 million of which may be used only for grants to those hbcus identified for inclusion in the interior departments hbcu historic preservation initiative for each of fiscal years 1996 1997 and 1998 15 million would be authorized federal funding for structures listed on the national register of historic places must be matched equally unless the secretary determines that an extreme emergency exists or that such waiver is in the public interest the bill as amended also stipulates that structures receiving federal funds may be altered later only with the concurrence of the secretary these structures represent the hopes and achievements of a group of people denied equal opportunity and justice and who succeeded despite the imposition of almost insurmountable legal and social obstacles in many cases the buildings were constructed by the students themselves many of them former slaves and came under constant attack particularly during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and 1970s as symbols of africanamerican pride and progress national park system resources representing africaffamerican themes are notably scarce these institutions provided the only avenue to a better life for many africanamericans and provided this country with some of its greatest leaders including many current members of congress the inadequacy

already authorized funds to be spent on these significant and underfunded resources the testimony received at the hearing from the many presidents of hbcus provided moving and eloquent affirmation of the significance of these resources and their importance to the africanamerican experience many of our colleagues have expressed strong support for this legislation and several were able to attend the

yield myself such time as i may consume i want to make it very clear right up front what we intend to do on this rule right now this is virtually a gag rule permitting just on republican substitute but no separate votes on three critical areas i am therefore urging members to defeat the previous question so that i can offer an amendment to the rule that makes in order just three additional amendments subject to 1hour of debate each first the michelsnowe amendment to strike the btu middle class energy tax and replace it with real spending cuts second an archer amendment to strike the tax increase on seniors social security benefits and third a stenholm substitute amendment for title xvi to provide entitlement caps with a real hammer enforcement mechanism that is all my amendment would do as much as we would like to make in order all of the amendment presented to the rules committee i think it is far better that we keep this previous question vote as simple as possible so that there is no mistake what your vote means to quote from this mornings wall street journal editorial the point is that members shouldnt be able to claim they opposed parts of the tax bill but were helpless to amend it a vote for the closed rule is a vote for the largest tax increase in american history if you told the average constituent in my district that this week we are voting on a reconciliation bill you would probably draw a blank look that is insidethebeltway budgetary jargon but if you tell that same constituent that we are considering the presidents tax billthe largest tax increase in historythere would be a look of instant recognition shock and outrage when the president first unveiled his tax program i thought the president might just get away with the socalled btu tax because it was beyond the comprehension of most of the btu might as well have stood for beyond taxpayer understanding but the public didnt take long to catch on to the btu tax in my district the people know it is going to hit them in the pocketbook at every turnfrom the gas station to the supermarket to state and local taxes to the home today btu is well understood to stand for bleed taxpayers unconscious it is a middle class tax increase plain and simple the same goes for the presidents senior citizen tax increase try as the president may to depict this as a tax on upper income individuals the senlors in my district who make 25 000 a year as individuals or 532 000 a year as couples hardly consider themselves wealthy its another tax on middle clas taxpayers only in this case on those who are retired on fixed incomes the purpose of a reconciliation bill is supposedly to bring our actual spending decisions into line with what we can affordto reconcile our appetites with our incomes the problem is as everyone knows that the government has a voracious appetite that can never be satisfied and so instead of curbing our appetite to match our income we are being asked to increase that income to feed that government appetite for more and more spending and more and more government programs unfortunately the government is not a selfsupporting creature that has any incomeproducing earning capacity it must therefore depend on the incomes of others to satisfy its insatiable appetites and the others it must depend on most heavily are the great mass of middle income workers who are barely getting by now on what they earn yet they are being told by the president that they must sacrifice more for the good of their government it is hard to believe that this is the same president who a few short months ago promised middle class taxpayers a tax out not a tax increase you may recall this little campaign book put out by governor clinton and senator gors entitled putting people first how we can all change america on page 15 of that book there is a paragraph entitled middle class tax fairness in which coauthors clinton and gore promised and i quote we will lower the tax burden on middleclass americans by asking the very wealthy to pay their fair share and it goes on middleclass taxpayers will have a choice between a childrens tax credit or a significant reduction in their income tax rate in the interests of truth in political advertising and labeling i think the president and vice president should publish a revised edition of their campaign book that reconciles their campaign promises with the reality of their record this book should be entitled putting taxes first how we will shortchange america that is just what is happening in this socalled reconciliation bill instead of getting a tax break middle class americans are getting shortchanged well that is not the kind of change my constituents voted for they did not send us here to raise their taxes they sent us here to cut government spending and that is why it is so important for us to change this unfair gag rule and make in order amendments that will do just thattake out the taxes on the middle class and replace them with deeper spending cuts they want us to be able to offer amendments to strike the middleclass energy tax and the middleclass seniors tax and replace them with spending cuts and yet the democrat majority leadership through its wholly owned subsidiary the rules committee has said no to the american people and to these amendments once again they have shut the people out of their own house for the sake of cramming the presidents tax increases down the throats of middleclass taxpayers the time has come for this house to do the right thing and say no to this antidemocratic and antimiddle class rule i urge my colleagues to vote down the previous question so that we can offer a substitute rule that will allow for separate votes to strike the middleclass energy tax and the senior citizens tax and substitute spending cuts for them vote down the previous question and for a rule that will allow us to offer responsible alternatives that will take the tax burden off the backs of the middle class and put the deficit reduction burden back on the congress by mandating spending cuts that is what the american people want us to do this is one of the most critical and important votes you will cast in this session make no mistake about it the people will not be fooled by any attempt to paint this as a procedural vote this is your vote on whether to tax or not to tax to cut

evening to bring before the house a most urgent matter one that not only determines the course of our future but whether we will indeed have a future im happy to say that several members of this body have joined me in this call of support for our children the families and children of america are suffering and we cannot rescue one without saving the other as a noted child advocate has said and i quote it a community values its children it must cherish their parents my colleagues the care and nurturing of our families and children must become a national priority it is no longer acceptable to pay lip service to this issue not when 22 percent of all childrenmore than 1 out of 5live in poverty as a woman of color i cannot in good conscience keep silent when i know that more than half of those children 55 percent to be exactare africanamerican or hispanic in this land where the american dream still looms large as the one thing for which we should all strive there are people who toll at hardlabor every day of the week and only to find themselves still below the poverty level almost 12 percent of the families in this rich nation of ours make up the working poor and again for families of color the figure doubles to over 25 percent members of the house it is meanspirited and disgraceful that we continue to allow these conditions to exist there are those members in this body who would vote against any initiatives to help families and children while at the same time professing a deep love and devotion to our nation and this democracy to those members i say this is a shortsighted and hypocritical way to do business if you want to prove your allegiance to america then do it by standing up for those who will lead her into the 21 century members of the conference committee will have the opportunity to do that over the next few days as the budget reconciliation bill takes shape the measure that was approved by the house held four provisions that would put both our children and our families first those programs are childhood immunization earned income tax credit the mickey leland hunger program and the family preservation and support program i ask the members of the house for their continued support for these programs lets start with the immunization program dont let anybody tell you that parents can get their children immunized if they simply would make the effort to do it the numbers dont support that myth right now the rate of immunization against deadly childhood diseases in this country is a measly 55 percent how can we look ourselves in the mirror and say its ok for 55 000 children to be crippled or killed by a preventable disease like measles it happened in 1991 and will most certainly happen again how can we simply stand by and allow polio mumps rubella and meningitis to take this terrible toll on our children i submit to you that we cannot and before you tell yourself that the vaccines are available to everyone so we really dont need to do anything about this problem let me quickly tell you that the cost of immunizing a child jumped from 11 in 1977 to 133 in 1992 its called an economic deterrent many low and middleincome families who lack health insurance simply cant afford the service included in the house reconciliation legislation is a universal vaccine assurance system which would serve 11 1 million children who are now currently uninsured or underinsured medicaideligible or native american in north carolina 290 000 children would receive vaccinations 116 000 more than are currently eligible under medicaid i argue that providing vaccines for children is not only the morally right thing to do it is also fiscally sound let me remind my colleagues that 1 spent on immunizations now saves at least 10 in treatment down the road to sum it up briefly we can pay the bill now or pay it later the choice is ours with the issue of hunger i make the same plea we can provide children with the proper nutrition to grow strong bodies and healthy minds now or pay the consequences later the mickey leland food stamp provisions are critical to addressing the grievous problem of hunger the nationwide community childhood hunger identification project released in 1991 reported that 5 5 million american children under age 12 are hungry this means 1 out of every 12 furthermore an additional 6 million children find themselves in families that are at risk of hunger because sometimes these families in order to pay their utility bills in the winter can not afford to buy food these figures are astonishing in light of the abundance that we find in american agriculture onehalf of the recipients of food stamp benefits are children while 80 percent of the benefits in the program go to families with children put simply the food stamp program is the frontline of defense for preventing hunger in america over 96 percent of the benefits go to people at or below the poverty line most58 percentgo to households that are so poor that their income does not exceed half of the poverty line we must not accept hunger as a standard in this country the mickey leland provisions of the reconciliation bill speak to the problem of hunger by providing basic subsistence to those who are in desperate need i deeply urge my colleagues to support the efforts of individuals like the late mickey leland who died while attempting to address the deplorable conditions faced by the hungry on the african continent after we have fed our children and provided for their health we must help empower their working parents to lift themselves out of poverty that is the goal of the earned income tax credit program currently about 5 million americans work 40hour weeks and still remain below the poverty line it is a disgrace that individuals in america can work full time and never rise out of poverty in the house reconciliation bill families with two or more children that earn up to 8 500 a yearwhat fulltime minimum wage work now pays would receive a wage supplement to bring them to the poverty line i believe that an expanded eitc is essential to reward work and pave the way for welfare reform further the eitc would be of great benefit to low and moderate income working families in north carolina some 485 000 working families with children in north carolina received the fjtc in 1992 the expanded eitc program in the house passed reconciliation bill would have ensured that those workers with families and childless workers were brought up to the poverty line this is especially important in light of the increasing tax burden on the poor without an expanded eitc program which includes childless workers we will be taxing those poorest among us deeper into poverty i urge all members to show their support for this program especially to the finance committee of the senate and the ways and means committee of the house to work for its inclusion in the conference report finally i ask that my colleagues on the conference committee pay special attention to the family preservation and supportprovision contained in the housepassed reconciliation legislation last year 2 9 million children an average of about 8 000 a day were reported abused and neglected more than three children a day died of maltreatment the 1 5 billion included in the house package would help prevent this neglect and abuse and possibly offset more expansive social service programs by providing funds for family support programs that teach parents early how to protect nurture and support their children the funding will help states develop and expand programs for families in crisis to help keep children and parents together and will improve the quality of foster care for those children who cannot be protected at home the senate did not include the family preservation and support program in its version of the budget reconciliation legislation it is my sincerest hope that my house colleagues will prevail with the house provisions today we have the opportunity to tell the world that america values its children and families above all other things that we respect the sanctity of the family unit and will do all we can to support and encourage families to stay together and work for their goals with a vote for the initiatives i have outlined this evening we can begin to erase the social deficits that have

just for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget

features of s 540 an omnibus bankruptcy bill that passed the senate by unanimous vote in april of this year are incorporated in the legislation we consider today 4in the 102d congress the house and senate committees on the judiciary compiled hearing records that documented the need for legislation to address a range of problems confronting participants in the bankruptcy process the last comprehensive rewrite of unitedstates bankruptcy law had been completed in 1978 by the early 1990s substantial updating was needed in response to burgeoning bankruptcy filings including megacases greater complexity characterizing financial transactions and unanticipated economic consequences of bankruptcy code provisions the priorities we recdgnized were to expedite bankruptcy procedures

and senate bills could be completed for that reason we have returnedalthough later in the 103d congress than i would have hopedto this important unfinished business bankruptcy case filings declined last year after eight consecutive years of significant increases but the 1993 total nevertheless exceeded 875 000more than double the 1985 figure in view of these statistics and the reality that some business bankruptcies in recent years have involved literally billions of dollars and many thousands of jobsthe profound economic consequences of bankruptcy cannot be overlooked we must meet the challenge of reducing bankruptcy delays discouraging abuses of the bankruptcy process and resolving bankruptcy law problems that needlessly burden american businesses this legislation includes many important provisions the following are some of the highlights we obviate the necessity of bankruptcy judges holding superfluous hearings when debtors with the benefit of representation by counsel seek to reaffirm obligations we seek to facilitate more expeditious resolutions of requests for relief from the automatic stayand we seek to discourage long postponements for filing proposedreorganization plans we encourage greater reliance on chapter 13 of the bankruptcy codean alternative to liquidationby making a broader range of debtors eligible to file under that chapter and contribute income under a repayment plan we provide explicit statutory authorization for bankruptcy judges to conduct jury trials with the consent of the parties when so designated by the district courtthus saving judicial resources in certain situations where the right to trial by jury is guaranteed we give expression to the inappropriateness of penalizing lenders for obtaining loan guaranteespenalties that eventually can constrict credit and increase interest ratesand for that reason effectively overrule the deprizio case we clarify that important bankruptcy code protections for entities that finance or lease aircraft vessels and railroad equipment covera broad range of transactions we modify the automatic stay in response to abuses involving some single asset real estate entities that file under chapter 11 solely for purposes of delay without any expectation of reorganizing successfully we provide additional safeguards for equipment lessors in recognition of problems they often face during the bankruptcy process we clarify judicial authority to issue injunctions in certain circumstances where trusts are created to pay asbestos related claimsbecause we recognize that by removing uncertainty over the validity of such injunctions the value of trust assets available to fund recoveries by victims can increase we safeguard a sellers important right to reclaim goods by extending the reclamation period in limited circumstances we remove the unjustifiable bar to the pension benefit guaranty corporation and state pensions funds serving on creditors committees h r 5116 encourages greater utilization of backruptcy appellate panels to hear appealswith the consent of the parties in bankruptcy cases we recognize however that bankruptcy appellate panels may not improve the administration of justice in some circuits and therefore provide judicial councils with flexibility in broadly specified circumstances the provisions of this bill necessarily are diverse because the

as a nation i think it is important that we consider it very soberly and consider the implications blueprint to lead us into this postcoldwar era a blueprint that has been used repeatedly over and over by our great military leaders since that time let me quote from that speech i believe the postwar period has taught us several lessons and from them i have developed six major tests to be applied when we are weighing the use of unitedstates combat forces abroad let me now share them with you first the united states should not commit forces to combat overseas unless the particular engagement or occasion is deemed vital to our national interest or that of our allies that emphatically does not mean that we should declare beforehand as we did with korea in 1950 that a particular area is outside our strategic perimeter second if we decide it is necessary to put combat troops into a given situation we should do so wholeheartediy and with the clear intention of winning if we are unwilling to commit the forces or resources necessary to achieve our objectives we should not commit them at all of course if the particular situation requires only limited force to win our objectives then we should not hesitate to commit forces sized accordingly when hitler broke treaties and remilitarized the rhineland small combat forces then could perhaps have prevented the holocaust of world war ii third if we do decide to commit forces to combat overseas we should have clearly defined political and military objectives and we should know precisely how our forces can accomplish those clearly defined objectives and we should have andsend the forces needed to do just that as clausewitz wrote no one starts a war or rather no one in his senses ought to do sowithout first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it war may be different today than in clausewltzs time but the need for welldefined objectives and a consistent strategy is still essential if we determine that a combat mission has become necessary for our vital national interests then we must send forces capable to do the joband not assign a combat mission to a force configured for peacekeeping fourth the relationship between our objectives and the forces we have committedtheir size composition and dispositionmust be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary conditions and objectives invariably change during the course of a conflict when they do change then so must our combat requirements we must continuously keep as a beacon light before us the basic questions is this conflict in our national interest does our national interest require us to fight to use force of arms if the answers are yes then we must win if the answers are no then we should not be in combat fifth before the unitedstates commits combat forces abroad there must be some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the american people and their elected representatives in congress this support cannot be achieved unless we are candid in making clear the threats we face the support cannot be sustained without continuing and close consultation we cannot fight a battle with the congress at home while asking our troops to win a war overseas or as in the case of vietnam in effect asking our troops not to win but just to be there finally the commitment of unitedstates forces to combat should be a last resort as we as a nation consider this weighty decision i think that we must reflect back on these questions asked by secretary weinberger and also ask ourselves is this a fight we are willing to go to the finish i do not think so i hope that the carnage of the last weekend the tremendous emotional appeal and the desire of every honorable person

workers and retirses i wish as well to express my hope that as we approach this very cornplicated area of the law that we proceed with gre care to measure the effects that these funding requirements will have on particular sectors of our economy surely we do not want in the name of reform to destroy jobs or threaten the well being of whole industries we need to proceed with caution and with the help of the companies that have underfunded plans and we need always to remember our erisa promise to our workers and retirees prmnx t pr~sorwl act of9im as a whole the defined benefit pension system insured by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pboc is strong and wellfunded there is however persistent pension underfunding in some singleemployer plans underfunding in singleemployer vian grew from 327 billion in 19f7 to 38 billion in 1991 and is expected to grow much more for 1992 at the end of 1991 about s12 billion in underfunding was in plans sponsored by troubled companies the pbg0 is in no immediate danger and will be able to pay benefits well into the foreseeable future but there are substantial longterm risks to participants the pbgc and the retirement plan system which must be squarely addressed now given the current funding rules the level of underfunding in plans of troubled companies and the pbgcs 2 7 billion deficit in the singleemployer program are likely to increase in the coming years the legislation has four major areas of reform plan funding rules compliance premiums and participant services funding the bill strengthens the funding requirements for underfunded plans the deficit reduction contribution drc which was enacted in 1967 to increase funding of underfunded plans has not accomplished its goal the drc was flawed in several ways the legislation will correct these flaws by eliminating the double counting of gains that significantly weaken the drc under current law specifying interest and mortality assumptions and requiring ira approval of changes in other assumptions in certain underfunded plans and accelerating the drc funding schedule under the accelerated funding schedule new liability would be amortized at 30 per year if the plans funding ratio is 0d or less versus a 35 or les funding ratio under current law plans that are fully funded for current benefit promises would not be affected by these rules further for plan years beginning after 1994 the bill requires sponsors to begin funding immediately for negotiated benefit increases that will become effective in the future as an extra safeguard plans at risk of not being able to pay benefits in the short term are required to have on hand enough liquid assets to cover three years benefit payments the provision is designed to reduce the possibility that these plans will run out of money the bill includes a transition rule to ease the impact of the new funding requirements under the transition rule funding percentages would increase in a measured way by 2s percentage points per year for the first five years and slightly higher percentages in the next two years the bill also deals with three issues of concern to employers that want to fund their pension plans or that have wellfunded plane the bill repeals the quarterly contribution requirement for fully funded plans the bill eliminates the current 10 excise tax on certain nondeductible contributions for combined contributions to a companys defined benefit and defined contribution plans that exceed 25 of payroll it also eliminates the 10 excise tax on nondeductible contributions for plans with fewer than 100 participants that fully fund all benefit liabilities upon plan termination plans with more than 100 participants may deduct this contribution under current law deductibility rules would not change compliance certain corporate transactions such as break up of a controlled group threaten funding of pension plans and increase the risk that participants in an underfunded plan will lose benefits the only current remedy is for the pbgc to petition the court to terminate the plan before the transaction other remedies are needed because plan termination can have harsh effects on plan participants and their employers the bill would enable pbgo to seek judicial relief short of plan termination such as a court order requiring that departing controlled group members remain responsible for pension underfunding for a period of time or provide security for part of the pension liabilities controlled groups with over 50 million in their underfunded plans outstanding liens for missed contributions or outstanding funding waivers of more than 1 million would be required to give pb30 30 days advance notice of certain events other compliance changes would require sponsors with over 50 million in underfunding or outstanding liens or funding waivers to provide pbg with better actuarial and financial information grant ongoing plans a claim for pension underfunding against liquidating sponsors or controlled group members prohibit employers from increasing benefits in underfunded plans during bankruptcy proceedings and give pbgc concurrent authority with the department of labor to enforce minimum funding requirements when missed contributions exceed 31 million premiums the bill increases for plans that pose the greatest risk by phasing out the s53 per participant cap on the variable rate premium the premium cap will be phased out over three years starting with plan years beginning on or after july 1 199420 the first year 60 the second year and 100 the third year because of the cap plans with the greatest amount of underfunding pay no additional premiums for increased underfunding in fact plans at the cap account for 80 of all singleemployer plan underfunding but pay only about 25 of pbgcs total premium revenues the flat rate premium of 319 per participant paid by all plans is not changed participant protection in addition to protections provided by the enhanced funding and compliance the bill contains other important participant protections too often workers and retirees do not know the risks to their benefits posed by underfunding until after their pension plan has been terminated the bill requires employers to provide participants in underfunded plans a simplified understandable explanation of the plans underfunded status and the limits of pbgcs guarantee the pbgc will provide a model notice for use by employers the bill also contains provisions to protect participants who are missing when their fully funded plans terminate employers would be required to transfer adequate assets to pb0 to pay for missing participants pb0c would pay the benefit to the particlpant when the participant contacts pbg0 or is otherwise located other changes the

the chairman of the social security subcommittee for his diligence persistence and perseverance he is a pleasure to work with and i thank him for another great effort this legislation addresses three

employees than the irs and the social security administration have been able to do combined as a result of the publicity that surrounded zoe baird a lot of hard working and normally lawabiding american taxpayers woke up to a terrible realizationthat they were tax cheats and law breakers i am sure that congress back in 1951 when domestic workers were first covered under social security never intended to make law breakers out of householders who hire cleaning ladies and parents who hire babysitters but that just what happened when it set the wage threshold at 50 a calendar quarter and never provided for any increase as the years went by a 50 quarterly threshold was probably more than adequate back in 1951 and easily exempted the occasional cleaning lady or babysitter earning a dollar an hour a day or two a month today 50 is just over a days pay at minimum wage the conference report before us addresses these problems first it raises this outdated 50 in wages paid in a calendar quarter to 1 000 paid in a year now i would have preferred a higher amount based on the fact that the 50 threshold amount was never indexed i strongly supported the 1 800 threshold that was passed by the house last year only to be stripped from the budget reconciliation bill at the insistence of the senateor even the 1 250 threshold that was in the house version of this legislation but i also appreciate the need to protect social security eligibility for thosewho spend their lifetimes cleaning other peoples homes many of whom are lowincome women i believe that the 1 000 threshold which will be indexed should be high enough to protect these employees and still relieve the average householder bf the burden of having to report wages of someone they occasionally employ in their home this legislation exempts teenagers under 18 who babysit or mow lawns because americans who employ babysitters and cleaning ladies have been expecting congress to fix this problem for over a year now i am pleased that the house conferees were successful in making these provisions retroactive to january 1994 it took 40 years to recognize and deal with this problem going back to the beginning of this year was the least congress could do fqr average americans who occasionally hire people to look after their children or mow their grass the legislation also allows householders who hire domestic workers to report and pay their employees social security taxes as part of their personal tax returns rather than have to complete all sorts of complicated additional paperwork because it will be easier for householders to pay the social security taxes on their domestic workers more domestic workers will end up getting the same social security credit that otherworker get toward disability or retirement benefits the second provision transfers a small part of the revenues now going into the social security retirement trust fund which the actuaries say has enough money to last until 2036 to

disabled workers and their families we recognize however that this transfer is just a bandaid and that the administration has to take a serious look at why the disability program is in trouble we are looking forward to getting the study they have been doing on this serious problem by october of next year we will also be closely monitoring ssas efforts to clear up its disability backlogs and do disability reviews in my opinion ssas failure to do these reviews and take nondisabled people off the rolls has not only contributed to the programs financial problems but to the publics lack of confidence as well there are serious problems at ssa but it will be an independent agency next year unfettered by hihs we will be expecting the leadership of this independent agency to do something about those problems the third provision is also overdue fourteen years ago congress voted to prohibit payment of social security benefits to criminals like the son of sam who are being completely supported at the taxpayers expense as they serve out their time behind bars this provision likewise prohibits payment of benefits to those who have committed terrible crimes but who are found not guilty by reason of insanity and are institutionalized at taxpayers expense instead of imprisoned to allow the criminally insane to collect benefits is an affront to the families of the victims of their terrible acts as well as to hardworking taxpayers it has been a long haul but we have finally taken action on problems that have been around a long time this legislation will help millions of average americans do the right thing fog those they employ to care for their children or clean their homes it will help ensure that the millions of severely disabled americans and their families will continue to receive benefits without worry and it will stop benefits to the criminally insane who are already institutionalized at taxpayers expense j am pleased that we are considering this important

is this reducing trade with china will not reduce oppression in china the best way to serve the cause of human rights in china is to trade with the chinese trade will create prosperity prosperity will create a chinese middle class a growing middle class in china will demand more and more and more political freedom and more freedom will help secure more human rights a vote for the hamilton amendment

va under secretary for health be a physician the committee concurs in principle with the apparent aim of that proposal to provide the latitude for appointment of the most qualified person available to the important position of va under secretary for health but the committee believes that that latitude must be balanced against the need to ensure that the highest levels of vha management retain physician leadership the senate bill was apparently based on a legislative proposal advanced by the department of veterans affairs on september 16 1993 the department submitted that proposal to the house and senate after a reportedly unsuccessful search of many months duration for a new under secretary and requested the introduction and enactment of legislation to lift the physician requirement for that position the department framed this request in terms of a quest for greater latitude to find the most qualified person for this important position va has been well served by physicians occupying the most senior positions in the veterans health administration and the department of medicineand surgery this committee does not lightly turn away from the vital and unique contributions physicianleaders can and do provide the veterans health administration whether in the role of advising a secretary of veterans affairs on the departments research budget negotiating with physician peers in other federal departments or appearing before committees of the congress a physician brings a unique expertise insight and stature yet there is force to the view that vha needs the most able leadership dramatic changes are underway within the national health care system which even without enactment of a national health care reform bill will require reforming the va health care system the inevitability of such change and the prospect that that change may be sweeping and complex underscores the importance of assuring the most able vha leadership while physicians have long provided that leadership it could conceivably also come from another clinical perspective or another sector with respect to the under secretary post the departments request that congress lift the physician requirement however raised questions its request provided no insight into the kind of analysis that led the department to the specific legislative solution it proposed moreover the request provided no insight into the nature of the process by which the search itself had been conducted or the basis on which a search committee would proceed under the proposed legislation the department offered no hint for example as to how it envisioned the search committee would weigh physicians against nonphysicians in identifying the most qualified candidate it became clear to the committee that the departments administration of the search process was flawed the committee on veterans affairs would have anticipated that that process would be thorough methodical and constituted so as to avoid any reasonable criticism the evidence suggested otherwise the committee found particularly disturbing for example the departments failure to furnish the members of the search commission any criteria by which to evaluate candidates other than the requirements of the law itself the significance of that failure was all the more striking in light of the committees understanding that of some 54 candidates judged to be qualified only 8 were interviewed the composition of the search commission is set by law and includes substantial representation from activities affected by the veterans health administration va gains immeasurably from the experience and insight of eminent professionals who participate in such a process but it is unreasonable for the department to abdicate taking a role which extends much beyond establishing the search commission and hosting its meetings in fairness to the commission members themselves the department owes them substantial guidance on the criteria they should employ in conducting their evaluations and their determinations on whom to interview absent specific sound criteria the process is open to the criticism that it is not free from the potential for arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking neither the secretary nor the commission members could tolerate a process open to such a perception in the belief that the department would share that view the subcommittee on hospitals and health care sought assurances from the secretary that the department would address these and related concerns regarding the search process regrettably the secretary has declined to do so or to provide assurances to that effect the above concerns led the committee on november 9 1993 to address these issues legislatively in a committee amendment to h r 3400 the government reform and savings act of 1993 which it ordered reported as amended in so acting the committee sought through amendments to title 38 to address its concerns regarding the conduct of the search process while at the same time providing greater latitude in filing the position of under secretary for health my proposed amendment to s 1534 would incorporate the pertinent provisions of the committee amendment to h r 3400 the amendment would provide in essence that if at the time a search commission were established the positions of deputy and associated deputy under secretary were held by physicians the under secretary could be a nonphysician in either case however the amendment would require the secretary to develop and furnish to the search commission specific criteria which the commission shall use in evaluating candidates the amendment would further require that in the case where the physician requirement was not applicable in filing the under secretary position the commission shall accord a priority to the selection of a physician over a nonphysician this physician priority requitement does not mean that nonphysicians may only be considered if the commission cannot identify a physician who meets the specific criteria developed by the secretary it does contemplate however that the criteria reflect and give weight to clinical experience and particularly to that of a physician the committee would expect that the criterik would also be weighed in a manner that would ensure that those individuals recommended for appointment would have a background which would provide a level of sensitivity to patients needs comparable to that gained from clinical practice the physician priority should also be read in the context of the requirement in law that the commission recommend at least three individuals for appointment it is inconceivable that a meaningful priority could have been afforded physicians if such a list of recommended candidates included only a single physician or failed to include any the committee does not presume to dictate to the secretary the list of criteria that official should establish such criteria should however take account of vas potential role as a competitor under health reform they should also recognize vas broad and relatively unique role as a provider of longterm care and psychiatric care and should give additional weight to candidates with such experience as regards the two positions immediately subordinate to the under seoretary the measure would also amend section 7306 of title 38 to permit the appointment of a nonphysician to either the deputy or associate deputy under secretary positions when two of the top three positions in the veterans health administration are held by physicians my proposed amendment to s 1534 reflects discussions between the house and senate and i urge my colleagues to support the amendment"]]}
