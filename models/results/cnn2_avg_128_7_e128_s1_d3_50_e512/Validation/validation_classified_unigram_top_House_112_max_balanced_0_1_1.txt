{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "2011 marked an unfortunate milestone in our countrys financial picture when for the first time in american history student loan debt actually exceeded credit card debt which again by itself is just a huge statement in terms of the challenges that families middle class families and working families are facing today in terms of trying to deal with the cost of higher education the value of a higher education degree or posthigh school degree which is sometimes debated in the media still i believe is indisputable and the statistics certainly demonstrate that at a time when our national unemployment rate is 8 3 percent if you drill down deeper youll learn that for those with less than a high school degree the unemployment rate is 16 5 percent those with a high school degree its 10 7 percent those with some college is 8 5 percent and those with a bachelors degree or higher is 4 5 percent so the stakes could not be higher for young people all across our country that we must deal with the mounting cost of higher education and provide mechanisms for them and their families to actually finance it and pay for it in 2007 the democraticcontrolled congress passed the college cost reduction act which was a terrific measure that cut the interest rates for the stafford student loan program the federally subsidized student loan program which provided some stability and affordability for middle class families from 6 8 percent down to 3 4 percent in addition we unfroze the pell grant program which is the workhorse of paying for college education all of it paid for by eliminating wasteful subsidies to banks that measure has a sunset this july the interest rate reduction of the college cost reduction act will in fact expire on july 1 unless congress acts president obama in his state of the union address a few nights ago raised this issue before all of us in the house and senate when he said when kids do graduate the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college at a time when americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt this congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in july shortly after his address myself and congressman peters from michigan introduced h r 3826 which is a measure that would extend the 3 4 percent the lower interest rates on the stafford student loan program and in just a few days we have accumulated 55 cosponsors to this measure again the math is crystal clear if we do not act if we do not maintain those interest rates at 3 4 percent if congress does nothing the unitedstates public interest research group has calculated that for those students who take out the maximum 23 000 in subsidized student loans their interest payments will increase by 5 200 over a 10year repayment period and 11 300 over a 20year repayment period now if you told middle class families that if congress doesnt act on a measure like this your outofpocket costs are going to go up 5 200 for taxes there would be a huge hue and cry about the fact that congress must not let that happen well thats exactly the same situation we face today with the stafford student loan program again we know from the passage of the college cost reduction act that this is something that this body is capable of doing this past weekend i was with a family whose son is now in his junior year and as an undergraduate has almost a perfect 4 0 grade average very motivated to go into the health care field and he has already accumulated 100 000 in student loan debt we as a nation must address this problem the national college board which tracks graduation rates internationally reminds us that back in the 1980s the unitedstates was number one in the world in terms of graduation rates we have fallen to number 12 according to the national college board and the biggest reason that students are not finishing college is because of affordability and cost again the president laid out the challenge to the congress in his state of the union address we must not allow stafford student loan interest rates to double on july 1 1l 1010 we should pass h r 3826 we should get that to the president so that colleges and universities can help families plan their tuition payments for the upcoming year and not allow this country to go backwards in terms of making sure that we have the

ii to 9 11 to hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and those who are less fortunate thats never been an american value i urge my colleagues to reject this ruse to reject the reconciliation process and to work toward a comprehensive and responsible and bipartisan deficit agreement reflective of our nations values"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "and im

this is the presidents budget if you look at all the other budgets presented today youll find numbers and youll find policy statements that describe the policies behind the budget the thing mr mulvaney filedno policy in fact he just said the presidents policy raises gas taxes i believe thats just a false statement the other issue is why you have a number for revenue in the presidents budget you mentioned that there was a revenue number the president never pretended otherwise the presidents budget takes a balanced approach to deficit reduction it makes cuts and it raises revenue lets talk about how he raises revenue he raises revenue in part by getting rid of subsidies on the big oil companies we think at a time of record profits we dont need to have taxpayer subsidies for big oil companies our republican colleagues almost every one of them have signed this pledge to grover norquist saying they wont get rid of one oil subsidy or one tax loophole for the purpose of deficit reduction well the president thinks we need a balanced approach to deficit reduction now you wouldnt know from reading mr mulvaneys document what he puts in place as the presidents budget that thats how the president raises revenue you wouldnt know from mr mulvaneys document that the president also asks the very top 2 percent of taxpayers to go back to paying the same top rate they were during the clinton administration a time when the economy was booming because the president thinks we need to take a balanced approach again a combination of revenues and spending cuts because the president believes and i agree that if you do it the way the republicans do it without asking the folks at the very top to share some responsibility it means you deal with the budget at the expense of everybody else at the expense of seniors at the expense of middleincome americans and at the expense of important investments in our economy like investments in transportation their budget cuts transportation next year by 46 percent at a time when we have 17 percent unemployment in the construction industry their budget puts the brakes on the budding economic growth so lets end this charade the gentleman said he wanted to get beyond politics this is politics at its absolute worst presenting something as the presidents budget without the policy detail without the explanation to the american people about whats in the presidents budget as a result he presents a very misleading version of what the president has asked us to do in fact the democratic alternative that we will propose later adopts the general framework of the presidents budget we dont adopt every single proposal he makes in here but we take the general framework the difference is we have those policy statements and we make it clear that we want to get rid of the subsidies for the big oil companies at a time theyre making record profits we make it clear that we want millionaires people making a million dollars a year to go back to paying what they were during the clinton administration we make that clear in our alternative so lets not play this political charade were going to have the democratic alternative that as i said

americans the unemployment rate is 13 6 percent and its 10 5 percent for latinos the rate of unemployment for our youth is even more alarming with over 23 percent of 1619 year olds looking for a job without a job how can we expect our youth the future of this country to develop the skills and experience they need to succeed and live out their american dream encouragingly president obama understands that we cannot speed up economic recovery without investments that create jobs i was pleased to see in his 2013 budget proposal critical investments to create good jobs and job training programs for communities hardest hit by our struggling economy by targeting economic assistance where its most needed the presidents proposed budget goes a long way to level the playing field to give every american the opportunity to succeed theres a lot that my republican colleagues can learn from the presidents budget especially this that fighting poverty and reducing the deficit can be achieved together but let me be clear this budget is not perfect there are cuts in this budget that would undermine some of the progress our economy is making cuts to safety net programs like the community services block grant low income heating assistance and affordable housing programs will hit already struggling families especially hard during these difficult times we really do need to protect programs that are a lifeline for the most vulnerable we need to increase funding for programs like snap and wic which keep millions of american families out of poverty but keeping people from suffering the worst effects of poverty is not enough to restore our economy even with the recent increases we have seen in job creation longterm unemployment remains at record levels with 5 5 million workers who have been out of work for 27 weeks or more until republican leaders in the house can pass president obamas american jobs act or put forth any kind of reasonable plan for job creation we must ensure that the safety net is strong so again i call for an immediate upordown vote on congressman bobby scotts and my bill h r 589 which will give the millions of job seekers who continue to struggle to find a job just 14 more weeks of vital unemployment benefits this would allow them to have just a little more time to find a good job and to support their family while our fragile economy continues to recover also this congress has a lot of work to do we are just a few days away from when unemployment benefits are set to expire for millions of americans across the country lowincome families were hardest hit during the recession and they cannot afford another year of a republican congress that fails to focus on jobs refuses to strengthen our middle class and tries to end the

republicans to propose gutting programs benefiting the arts and humanities its as predictable as it is irresponsible and unwise its the same old pennywise poundfoolish approach we have come to expect from a party that wants to spend lavishly on corporate giveaways while cutting just about every initiative that empowers the american people and improves lives and our communities i cant believe that while the nation stands on the brink of default while republican stubbornness puts us less than a week away from economic calamity were having a debate about funding for the arts that represents 3 cents 3 cents for every 100 of nonmilitary discretionary spending three cents believe me the budget for the national endowment for the arts isnt breaking the bank grants to support museums and theater companies are not what caused a huge deficit and cutting them will not put us on a fiscally responsible course in fact investments in the arts more than pay for themselves for every 1 spent on arts programs the country gets back 9 in economic benefit my friends on the other side of the aisle love to make arts funding a scapegoat they never miss an opportunity to turn a spending debate into a culture war referendum on art but lets be clear the arts represent a vital economic industry a mainstream employer of millions of americans and an integral part of a functioning society the nonprofit arts sector generates more than 12 billion in tax revenues and more than 166 billion in economic activity every single year communities that have a vibrant artistic life are magnets for tourism and new businesses that create jobs theres also evidence that communities that embrace the arts tend to have higher real estate values more civic activities and volunteerism less crime and lower poverty rates the arts are also a critical ingredient in the development of our children with research showing that students receiving arts education perform better academically and are more likely to succeed in life but despite all the ways that arts support the common good republican leaders want to cut nea instead i think its time we cut big oil subsidies and cut loopholes for corporate jet owners arts programs have already taken a budget hit in recent years and are trying to do more with less if we can give billions in subsidies to oil companies that are already raking in record profits then surely we can maintain modest investments in the nonprofit arts sector that makes a vital contribution to american life lets stop blaming small agencies for a fiscal crisis that was caused by three wars and

rises i ask myself the question and i ask this body who will speak for the children and thats why my amendment attempts to fully fund the women infants and children program that provides food for the nations children it provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods nutrition education and health care referrals to lowincome pregnant and postpartum women infants and children up to 5 years old we must remember that children have always been the largest category of wic participants of the 8 7 million people who received wic benefits each month in fiscal year 2008 about 4 33 million were children and 2 2 million were infants this bill cuts 650 million out of wic and i am so glad my good friend from georgiaand i appreciate his friendshipjust got up and said the agricultural research service is pretty darn well funded 900 million i am simply asking to address the question of the staggering devastation of malnutrition in our children and i have indicated that when you look at worldwide numbers malnutrition can kill but here in the united states there are children that go to bed hungry there are women that do not eat properly there are babies that do not get nourishment in texas alone between 23 000 and 40 000 people are expected to be dropped from the wic program if the funding is not restored and each and every state in the union is going to receive that kind of devastating impact can you imagine 40 000 women infants and children not being able to eat because we wont restore full funding texas has three of the top 40 districts with the highest national food hardship rates and in the 18th congressional district there are 159 000 food insecure people the food insecurity rate is 23 percent and texas stands 32 in the nation out of 435 districts we are 32 in food insecurity so let me just say alongside of obesity eating wrong we have to face the actual question of hunger children who are served by the wic program in texas are less likely to eat fast food in comparison to children who are not in this program again i want you to look at this picture healthy children need to eat healthy and i ask my colleagues why in fact would we not want to fully fund the program of women and infant children i will say that the impact of not eating healthy is obesity and poor health this healthy baby healthylooking baby has a future that is undetermined when you have an issue of lack of healthy food and access to such so 650 million when were in essence funding research for 900 million i believe you can share a little because the wic program is beneficial in helping the most vulnerable in our country i ask the question who will speak for the children it is important that the wic program 9 2 million through 10 000 clinics among this group 4 9 million children 2 1 million infants and 1 million women have the ability to be served around the nation its a complementary program having healthy mothers healthy pregnant mothers to give birth to healthy babies to raise healthy children not obese nourished and ready to be leaders in this nation who are we if we are not going to speak for our children and i ask my colleagues to consider waiving procedural issues to ensure that children are served i believe that is an important issue and in my district in the 18th congressional district with 1 000 census tracts of people who are food insecure i am arguing vigorously for the full funding of the wic program to help our women our infants and their children who will speak for our children what will their future be and how will they lead this country if we do not invest with them today i ask my colleagues to support this amendment i rise today in support of my amendment to h r 2112 agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies appropriations act 2112 as it restores full funding to the women infant and children wic program as the founder of the childrens caucus and a member of the womens caucus i have firmly stood in support of the nutritional needs of our nations families as a country we must protect and safeguard the health and nutrition of our nations lowincome families women infant and children wic provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods nutrition education and health care referrals to lowincome pregnant and postpartum women infants and children up to age 5 who are found to be at nutritional risk during the final quarter of fiscal year 2009 the number of women infants and children receiving wic benefits each month reached approximately 9 3 million we must remember that children have always been the largest category of wic participants of the 8 7 million people who received wic benefits each month in fiscal year 2008 about 4 33 million were children and 2 22 million were infants wic is essential because it affords many women especially women of color in lower income brackets the opportunity to care for themselves and their newborns after birth without programs such as wic many mothers would not be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle during pregnancies and after childbirth because of wic mothers can afford the nutritional foods they need to sustain their pregnancies and avoid miscarriages stillbirths and defects caused by malnourishment during pregnancy today i am proud to support a full restoration of funding to wic this program which is distinctly american demonstrates that we place a high value on feeding our nations children and tending to the needs of our nations poor thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence that we are endowed with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed i believe that it is no coincidence that life is listed firstfor without it the founders realized no other rights can be realized over many years the millions of americans who could not access medical services were denied their right to lifea life with access to quality and affordable health care let me set the record straight wic is good for the american people and will go a long way in ensuring access to quality and affordable care to those millions of americans who will need access to proper nutrition wic helps to ensure that our country will not succumb to one of the most staggering causes of death in children around the world malnutrition malnutrition remains a significant problem worldwide particularly among children it should not be a problem within the united states that is why we have programs like wic according to the united nations world food programme severe acute malnutrition affects an estimated 20 million children under the age of five worldwide and is responsible in whole or in part for more than half of all deaths of children malnutrition kills approximately one million children each year or an average of one every thirty seconds this is not the direction we want to take the united states when i stand here today and reflect upon what we are about to embark upon i cannot help but think of some of the last words that the great senator ted kennedy shared in his letter to president obama the senator said and so because of your obamas vision and resolve i came to believe that soon very soon affordable health coverage will be available to all in an america where the state of a familys health will never again depend on the amount of a familys wealth and while i will not see the victory i was able to look forward and know that we willyes we willfulfill the promise of health care in america as a right and not a privilege well senator your lifes work shall today be proven to not be in vain i continue to stand by protecting the health needs of low income families and yes this program ensures the health of infants and children will never again depend on the amount of their familys income in the words of the great president john f kennedy the voters selected us in short because they had confidence in our judgment and our ability to exercise that judgment from a position where we could determine what were their own best interests as a part of the nations interest while my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to believe that without a cut to wic this will harm americans nothing could be further from the truth this bill is indeed in their best interests there are 110 million schoolaged children suffering from hunger every day and they are counting on americas leadership and generosity to provide them with an opportunity to break the cycle of poverty the wic program provides that leadership and generosity and it is for this reason that i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for restoring full funding to wic in the words of the great civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr we have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now we cannot

that is presented to us today along with this republican study committee alternative would say that we must continue the tax cuts for the wealthiest americans in this country we must continue to give a millionaire about 130 000 in tax cuts in this budget even though we are facing the largest deficits our country has experienced at the same time the choice that this republican budget makes is to say to seniors we must end medicare as we know it we must eliminate the guarantee that you as a senior have had for more than 35 years under medicare to choose your doctor and your hospital and we must impose upon you an additional 6 000 in health care costs because these deficits are so big so as the president said a couple of days ago under the republican budget you would need to take 22 seniors paying 6 000 additional dollars to cover the costs of giving one millionaire in this country the 130 000 tax cut we must do that under the republican budget democrats have said we must not do that we must do this differently and we must invest again in our people on health care we dont believe that americans who are seniors should be given a coupon instead of a guarantee but thats what the republican budget does it says youre going to get a voucher a coupon essentially once youve used it the extent of the value of that coupon the rest of the money to pay for your health care comes out of your pocket thats why the president said 6 000 additional dollars for each senior under medicare under the republican plan coupon care instead of medicare thats what you must have under the republican budget democrats say we must invest in medicare and find the cuts to get rid of the waste in medicaid that we know exists the duplication of services that seniors dont need we can do this

their jobs or have seen their incomes reduced because of the economy have had a difficult time putting food on their tables its common to see families who once volunteered at or donated to local food pantries now stand in line for food from these very same nonprofit organizations unfortunately these organizations have had difficulty meeting the demands theyve faced over the past few years the good news i suppose is that the new usda report shows that fewer people were food insecure in 2010 than in 2009 the bad news is that there are still 48 8 million americans who struggled to put food on their tables last year frankly these numbers are unacceptable its unconscionable that even one person in this country goes without food let alone 48 8 million people it breaks my heart that 16 2 million of these hungry people are children thats almost a quarter of the total food insecure population president obama pledged to end childhood hunger by 2015 its clear barring some dramatic shifts

that these figures would be much worse if it werent for the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap formerly known as food stamps snap is a true safety net program that helps lowincome

world of nations and this could well improve the human rights situation in iran as it has no justification for the police state which denies human rights congress should give diplomats space to do their jobs undercutting diplomacy with new sanctions would put our country on the path to war the choice is clear we can try to negotiate a deal that prevents an iranian nuclear weapon and avoids a nuclear conflict or we can dismiss this opportunity pile on more sanctions derail diplomacy and continue toward war americans dont want another war the best way to honor our men and women in uniform is to avoid unnecessary war my son is active duty military i am speaking from a personal place as well americans support a negotiated deal with iran by a 21 ratio 68 percent say congress should not take action that would block an agreement passing any punitive measures including a sense of congress tying the presidents hands is a mistake it will not help and if congress wants to help we should

she did withdraw that really wanted to codify into law the usdas rules regarding the school lunch program and while i wont go into the lengthy reasons why its the wrong way to go for nutritionnot just the cost that it bears to the schools but also the fact that usda was recommending reducing the consumption of potatoes corn peas and lima beans to just one serving a weekwhich believe me i was shocked but it wasnt just myself that had this reaction it was also the california fruit growers association it was the national school boards association it was the council of the great city schools that wrote a letter and thats why i and 40 other colleagues wrote to mr vilsack of the unitedstates department of agriculture in reaction to the promulgation of these rules i will enter into the record the testimony i was going to give until she withdrew the amendment as well as these four letters mr chair i rise in opposition to this amendment breakfasts and lunches served in schools are important components of the diets of school age children improving the nutritional profile of meals served to school children is very important when the usda proposed a rule that eliminated potatoes from the school breakfast program and limited the school lunch program to one cup a week of potatoes i was very concerned on the agriculture committee i have made it frequently known how important healthy living and nutritious eating habits are to me as a person a mother a grandmother and as a legislator it is especially near and dear to my heart when we discuss policies that affect childrens nutritional needs when i heard that the usda recommended reducing the consumption of potatoes corn peas and lima beansi was shocked when my daughter was growing up i took great care to ensure that she ate healthy balanced meals of course potatoes were a part of that equation you all know that they are full of potassium vitamins c and b6 potassium fiber and antioxidants i cannot understand why the usda would want to reduce school childrens consumption of potatoes i think that it is short sighted for the usda to ignore the health benefits that the potato provides when looking at how to incentivize healthier eating habits we in congress need to find a way to encourage and educate program recipients to eat balanced meals i think it is very important to make sure that children receive balanced meals and that certainly includes potatoes i along with fortyone of my colleagues sent a letter to the usda asking a number of questions about this proposed rule without objections i would like to submit a copy of this letter to the record mr chair potatoes lima beans peas and corn are all healthy vegetables that should certainly be in the school breakfast and lunch programs potatoes are an excellent source of potassium and good source of fiber according to the usdas own magazine amber waves potatoes deliver these nutrients at a very low cost fns has estimated that the proposed rule would increase the cost of school meals by 6 8 billion over the next five years per meal the cost will increase by 14 cents per lunch and fifty cents per breakfast mr chair school districts and states across the country are already cashstrapped and cannot afford this increased cost this additional burden will be passed onto students paying full price for their meals while i agree with the intent of the usda to encourage the consumption of more fruits and vegetables whole grains and lean proteinsrestricting the consumption of nutritious vegetables like potatoes lima beans peas and corn is shortsighted and not the most effective approach to achieve that goal i encourage my colleagues to vote no on this amendment and instruct the usda to issue a new proposed rule on implementing the new national nutrition standards for the school breakfast and school lunch programs"], [0.9999999999846354, 1.536457940043423e-11, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in strong

for their leadership on this issue this resolution expresses the sense of the house of representatives with respect to the establishment of the democratic and prosperous republic of georgia within its internationally recognized borders which includes abkhazia and south ossetia as regions of georgia it is time for russia to remove its occupying forces from abkhazia and south ossetia and comply fully with the august 12 2008 ceasefire agreement it is also time for the russian federation venezuela nicaragua tuvalu and nauru to revoke their recognition of the georgian regions as independent states and respect georgias sovereignty the territorial integrity of georgia has been reaffirmed by the international community multiple times in united nations security council resolutions i commend georgia for its commitment to a peaceful reunification of its territories and its engagement in constructive confidencebuilding measures towards the occupied territories aimed at reconnecting the divided communities georgia has had success in laying the foundation for a liberal democratic state and i urge the government of georgia to consolidate its impressive accomplishments since the 2003 rose revolution the reforms needed to strengthen georgias nascent democracy are wellknown an independent judiciary respect for human rights and the rule of law a vibrant civil society independent media accountable and transparent policymaking and a balance of power between the executive and legislative branches these reforms will be the strongest guarantor of georgias independence and prosperity ahead of us the october 1 parliamentary elections can serve as yet another important benchmark of the deepening democratic process in georgia these will be followed by presidential elections a step backwards would not only be a blow to the development of georgias democracy but ultimately to its independence there have been some disturbing reports concerning efforts to prevent some political leaders from running in the parliamentary election and attempts to intimidate local opposition including denying them access to media these issues must be addressed in order to ensure that georgia has truly free and fair elections with this resolution today we affirm that the united states remains committed to the sanctity of georgias sovereignty and independence and to the inviolability of its

personal note that i am very proud of the relationship between the united states and georgia and i would look forward to a day when georgia is a member of the european union and also a member of nato i think that the west must not overlook its commitments in georgia simply because we may wish to have better relations with russia we can never cast aside democratic principles because they happen to be inconvenient at the time we should stand with the nation of georgia and let the world know including russia that we stand by their democracy and will not allow any slipping backwards and will not

where i was were in the southeastern portion of arizona over here everybody has heard of tombstone but i was a little further south than tombstone all the way to the border and douglas arizona which is in the corner the southwestern corner of arizona and next to new mexico and along that portion of the southern border of the united states visiting primarily with the people that were in charge of border security the border patrol and the ranchers who live along the border let me talk about the ranchers first one of those ranchers mr krentz a year ago was murdered on his ranch apparently by illegals coming into the united states he was gunned down and killed the culprits that committed that crime by the way have not been brought to justice i met with other ranchers in the entire region and just asked them the question tell me what its like to live on the border of the united states and mexico as a ranch owner and they went on forever and forever and told me things that i was just really somewhat surprised about how they feel like the border is wide open that people cross across their ranches people come in they destroy their property they destroy their water lines all of this costs money to the ranchers and of course they have to be the ones that pick up the bill for the destruction on their property and they dont feel safe about the people that cross into the united states across their land they feel like the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has jurisdiction that includes arizona but goes up to the new mexico border and so when illegals cross into the united states near new mexico or arizona some of them ask the question am i in the 9th court which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first obligationto protect americans and thats just the way it is"], [0.9999998807907104, 0.9999998807907104, 0, "said i

three democratswho had been on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the deaths in america preventive care would be reined in it would slash block grant funding in the united states to help 23 million children seniors and disabled americans live independently and out of

reduces food assistance for almost 2 million needy people one of the republican candidates running for president said president obama is the food stamp president there are more poor people our economy has been in bad shape people are struggling the millionaires are doing fine and in addition to what i have already mentioned this thing that they are taking up in the house today cuts off almost 300 000 children from free school lunches at a time when one in five children lives in poverty the unitedstates conference of catholic bishops said the republican plan fails a basic moral test this budget sets very clear priorities the problem is what they are taking up in the house sets up the wrong priorities president franklin roosevelt said human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened

the pentagon has said time and time and time again they believe in an allvolunteer military the allvolunteer military is superior to forced enlistment as in the years of the draft were a higher quality were using significant incentives to get people to enlist in the military and we have the best military in the world as a result so why would we maintain this bureaucracy heres what they spent 25 million on or intend to this year it will be used for expenses of attendance at meetings for purchase of uniforms now beyond me im not certain what the uniforms are i served actually on a draft board once and we didnt have uniforms i dont know i guess now weve got uniforms for people who are going to go sit somewhere and hear claims if we ever reimpose the draft i really dont know who theyre purchasing uniforms for or what the purpose might be or what a selective service members uniform might look like they also will hire passenger motor vehicles and for official reception and representation expensesall for a dead bureaucracy that does nothing and never will do anything now colleagues truly if we are serious here if we are in a crisis and were going to cut programs that actually have large constituencies my phones been ringing off the hook about public broadcasting other people are hearing about other programs heres one where youre not going to get a single call except maybe a thankyou if you eliminate this useless bureaucracy that will never be activated for any purpose foreseeable in the future colleagues we have twice actually in the house voted to end the selective service system in 1993 when democrats were in control and in 1999 when the republicans were in control unfortunately the termination of the program never became law now is the time now is the time im just dedicating the money to deficit reduction it could be used to restore some meritorious spending elsewhere within this title by somebody else with that i would yield back the balance of my time and urge my colleagues to end this useless bureaucracy"], [0.999999034178245, 9.658217550168047e-07, 1, "the rapidly expanding federal regulatory burden is a bipartisan problem and i commend the chairman of the committee my friend from missouri for his efforts in working not just in his time as chairman but working with the committee in the previous years and i know that he understands that this is not a republican or a democratic problem because the regulatory burdens on small businesses increased by 30 billion from the years 20012008 and federal regulations now cost americans 1 75 trillion each year which is up 50 percent from the 1 1 trillion in annual costs just in 2005 and last year the federal register contained 80 000 pages in its first year in print the federal register contained 2 355 pages and each year federal agencies continue to release thousands of pages of new regulations and accompanying information and i know that the gentleman understands that and we share the goal of reducing this burden because the burden is detrimental and it affects small businesses in fact studies indicate that adhering to federal rules cost 10 585 per worker for small businesses with 19 or fewer workers but only 78 percent of that amount for businesses with 500plus workers it affects small businesses disproportionately overall on a peremployee basis it costs 2 400 or 45 percent more for small businesses to comply with federal regulations than their larger counterparts small businesses face the greatest disadvantage in complying with environmental and tax regulations compliance with environmental regulations cost 364 percent more in small firms than large and 67 percent more for the cost of corporate tax compliance so we agree on the problem the question is where do we go from here and this is where i have a concern with what chairman graves is putting forward what does h res 72 call for that were not already doing the committee on small business has been reviewing regulations in a bipartisan fashion for years the gentleman has been involved in that and as a result of these examinations its called on federal agencies to modify or alter regulatory requirements that impose costs on small firms this has included regulations pertaining to medical equipment at cms accounting requirements at the sec real estate procedures at hud environmental regulations at the epa and on it goes so the reality is weve already done as a committee what this resolution calls for and i will include in the record the 112th congress small business committees oversight of federal regulatory and paperwork burdens administrative plan what the committee has already passed so my question for the gentleman from missouri to answer during the course of the debate is what exactly does this resolution do for small businesses that were not already doing is there anything in this thats not already being done now does it actually reduce any real regulatory burden on small businesses does it reduce paperwork does it limit government requirements on the small business community i would submit that this particular resolution does not it sets up a bureaucratic process here in the congress with a goal of inventory of regulations a long list of inventory regulations but this list will be submitted as part of an administrative reporting process it does nothing for small businesses so i would suggest in closing that instead of approving this bookkeeping resolution what congress really needs to do is strengthen the tools it already has available to reduce regulatory burdens this includes the regulatory flexibility act which mandates that federal agencies consider the potential economic impact of federal regulations strengthening the requirements and increasing agency reviews and regulations regulatory relief that we passed here in the congress during the 110th congress reported out by the small business committee related to bipartisan regulatory reductions and as we continue to revisit these issues here in the 112th congress we must remember that small businesses are who were trying to help so in closing im concerned that what this legislation does is add an unnecessary step to getting down to the business that we can all agree on which is actually reducing the regulations that we all agree are a problem"],

would update an antiquated mining law to end the free ride that mining companies extracting minerals like gold and silver and uranium on public lands currently enjoy it would then send that money to benefit western states by dedicating the funding to cleaning up the more than 160 000 abandoned mines we have in the west the underlying bill would extend a host of new giveaways to the mining industry while doing nothing to ensure taxpayers are getting a proper return on these valuable minerals like gold and silver and uranium on public lands it is well past time to fix this law that was passed during the presidency of ulysses s grant in 1872 my amendment would require mining companies to pay taxpayers 12 5 percent of the value of these hard rock minerals taken off of the public lands that is the same royalty rate that coal and oil and natural gas companies pay to the federal government to mine and drill on public lands while mining companies pay no royalty on federal lands to mine for gold and silver they do pay a royalty on state lands that would abut those federal lands twelve western states already require mining companies to pay royalties up to 12 percent on mining on their state lands colorado charges up to 12 percent on minerals taken from their state lands utah wyoming and california all charge up to 10 percent nevada charges up to 5 percent but when it comes to mining on federal lands which could be right next door to the state lands these multinational mining companies they still get to play uncle sam for uncle sucker they pay federal taxpayersall of the rest of us in the countryno royalties while reaping this massive windfall so what my amendment would do is it would ensure that the states where this mining is occurring reap the benefits according to the gao there are more than 160 000 abandoned gold and silver and copper and uranium and other mines in the west some estimates put that number as high as 500 000 abandoned mines these mines stopped production decades or in some cases more than a century ago and have no responsible parties to carry out the proper environmental remediation the result is that the streams and the rivers the aquifers the soils continue to be contaminated by mercury and thorium and arsenic and other toxic pollutants in fact the gao says that more than 33 000 mines are already a danger to the public health and environment arizona has some 50 000 abandoned hard rock mines california has more than 47 000 utah and nevada have 17 000 and 16 000 respectively according to the congressional research service cleaning up abandoned mine sites can cost tens of millions of dollars per mine well my amendment would generate nearly 400 million over the next 10 years that would be dedicated to cleaning up these sites this would ensure that mining companies are paying their fair share to aid our western states in cleaning up these dangerous and toxic sites at this point i would like to reserve the balance of

make is about what this underlying bill does to fda it cuts fda federal drug administration by 21 percent about 580 million on top of that the fda has to absorb another 37 million in higher rent costs so were really talking about a reduction to fda of about 600 million and yet we keep the law in place so they have to continue all the current requirements and activities that are mandated to them this kind of cut means that 2 000 fewer domestic and foreign inspections of firms that manufacture food and medical products can be made this kind of cut means that more than 9 000 fewer fda import inspections to verify that imported food and medical products meet safety standards this kind of cut means there will be 4 000 fewer food and medical product samplings to identify safety problems the amendment that i was going to introduce would have moved some funds from the commissioners office to the center for devices and radiological health or known as cdrh the center for devices and radiological health is responsible for bringing new technologies to market and to make the medical devices that are already on the market safer and more effective the fda has implemented a more streamlined process by which medical devices can get to market called the innovation pathway but with the cuts to the fda budget in this bill the innovation pathway will become innovation roadblock at a hearing at the energy and commerce subcommittee on health on february 17 2011 the director of cdrh dr jeffery shuren testified that these cuts the innovation pathway would be a nonoption and for the rest of what we do this would result in increased delays in decisions it would deny patients truly safe and effective innovative technologies and it will result in jobs being lost so moving funds even nominal funds to cdrh makes a point that we would have to maintain a commitment to getting critical medical devices to market and to patients the other point i wanted to make is the center for devices and radiological health is also responsible in part for the fda advances in medical countermeasures this medical countermeasures program extends across several fda offices the program coordinates the appropriate responses to national medical catastrophes for cdrh that means putting in place the right medical responses to radiological threats threats like a dirty bomb a rogue nuclear device or even a natural disaster like the one that occurred in fukushima after the earthquake and tsunami this isnt just a health concern its a homeland security concern unless we are ready to handle these emergencies many many people could die or be permanently disabled we have to prepare the cdrh can do that for us but not with a budget cut like the one the fda is facing the 21 percent cut in the fda budget means the public health of americans is put at risk is put on hold medical safety devices are put on hold medical countermeasures are put on hold radiological treatment improvements like new forms of x rays pet scans and mris are put on hold i say it again the 21 percent cut in the fda budget is not good for americas health i wish that we didnt have to adopt a budget with that kind of a

permitting act and i want to thank our energy and commerce ranking member for providing time representing a heavily industrialized area thats naturally sensitive to air quality issues i appreciate how the epas enactment of clean air act provisions has positively attributed to our goal of cleaner air for that reason i have remained hopeful that epas administrative air permitting barriers to exploring alaskas outer continental shelf would be addressed but they havent as such we continue to see air permits for offshore exploration wells perpetually go back and forth between the producer the epa the environmental appeals board with no movement towards a final decision thats why i am an original cosponsor of the jobs and energy permitting act which would rectify several of those process questions so that we can safely and responsibly produce our natural resources in the arctic ocean the epa needs to have a permit approval system in place that is predictable workable and understandable when i hear that in the last 5 years shell has drilled over 400 exploration wells worldwide while waiting for one single permit for alaska somethings definitely wrong with the process while the opponents of this legislation are saying that this bill guts the clean air act thats just not true because all this bill does is match epas outer continental shelf permitting process with the air permitting process employed by the department of the interior in the gulf of mexico a clean air act air permitting process that has been successfully used for decades by doing so we can rest assured that we have a strong offshore air permitting process but that these projects are not left in limbo like we have seen with the environmental appeals board in recent years i also want to remind my colleagues that this bill just addresses permits for exploration wells where activity typically only lasts for a few days not production wells where activities last for months i have long been a supporter of safe and responsible drilling on the outer continental shelf as these resources are a vital source of energy for the united states with skyrocketing fuel costs it is imperative for the

important our efforts to bring freedom and democracy to libya should not be the occasion to undermine democracy and the rule of law here in the united states now there is considerable constitutional argument about the powers of the president there are those who say he cannot take any military action without first an action by congress but in 1802 president jefferson sent american naval and marine forces in the words of the song to the shores of tripoli and the founding generation of this country thought that that was consistent with presidential power so those who think that the president has no power to ever engage i think must look at our history as well as the text of our constitution at the same time there are those who say the president can do anything without congressional approval and i think those folks go way too far the answer is the war powers act the law of the land and we need to make sure that it is followed now that law not only requires various reports and consultation it says that if hostilities are to continue for more than 60 days that congress must pass in both houses a resolution authorizing such activity and that if after 60 days congress has not passed such resolution then the president has 30 days to withdraw this is the law of the land and yet last week in both private session and in public hearings high ranking members of the state department declared by their vagueness that they might not follow the war powers act that is why it is critical that we as a nation demand that even those who are sworn to uphold the law follow the law themselves and that we in congress add to any spending bill a provision that says no funds shall be spent for the purpose of violating section 5 of the war powers act which some also refer to as the war powers resolution second who pays for all of this the cost is far greater than the 500 million to 600 million being estimated by the defense department i am a cpa they are using the marginal cost approach which is widely discredited any full costing will show what the american people fully understand and that is that this is costing us billions of dollars every week now we have seized 30 billion of libyan assets assets of qadhafi that were invested here in the united states those assets should be used first before we use money collected from american taxpayers libya produces more oil per capita than any nation you can find on a map without a magnifying glass more oil per capita per person than even saudi arabia i realize libya will need to be rebuilt but its oil revenues will return and provide for that and we should quietly insist that the benghazi council pass a resolution authorizing the united states to use those seized libyan assets to fund our military efforts but there is something even more that we should insist on from those who are running eastern libya and that is that they use their best efforts and i realize they are disorganized to cut off their contact with and even seek to extradite those in their midst who have american blood on their hands there is for example mr alhasadi who fought us in afghanistan and pakistan who brags that he dispatched soldiers to kill americas finest in iraq and who is now one of the rebel commanders we should insist that such individuals be turned over to the united states and if they cant find them that they at least disassociate themselves now the administration responds by saying that qadhafi has american blood on his hands and i am sure that qadhafi has after pan am 103 more american blood on his hands than do any collection of rebel leaders but is this the standard by which we judge those that we ask our men and women to die for to put themselves in harms way for to kill for i do not think that it makes sense to say that the rebels should be aided as long as they have less american blood on their hands than does mr qadhafi the test of whether these rebels will be allies and friends of america or the opposite is whether they turn over or use their best efforts to turn over alhasadi to the united states"], [0.0003243982791900635, 0.49967560172080994, 0, "i demand a recorded vote the acting chair
