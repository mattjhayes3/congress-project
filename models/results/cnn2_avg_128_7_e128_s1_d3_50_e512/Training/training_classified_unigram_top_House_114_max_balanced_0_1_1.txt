percentplus of americans who support commonsense reforms to stop gun violence like background checks and keeping guns away from terrorists while the recent tragedy in orlandoa tragedy that claimed 49 innocent livessparked the sitin there have been too many victims of gun violence throughout our country for too many years in my district in 2012 we suffered a large campus mass shooting these people were trying to get an education they were studying to become nurses because they wanted to help people but their lives were cut too short by gun violence a man with a semiautomatic weapon killed tshering bhutia doris chibuko sonam chodon grace kim kathleen ping judith seymour and lydia sim sadly these arent the only members of my community who have lost their lives or loved ones to gun violence let me remember some of the victims of gun violence in my own community once again in my district for example there were 89 gun deaths in 2015 what is worse many of these were children since july 2009 nearly 50 students in the oakland unified school district have been slain let me be clear that is 50 kids why isnt the speaker allowing us to do anything about this just this past weekend in my community four people were gunned down in two separate incidents every day in my community and places around this country this senseless violence continues how can house republicans just ignore this bloodshed let me talk about a few additional victims so you can just understand their lives and share the horror that cut their loves so short davon ellis this is davon davon was a star football

a victim of gun violence and i really appreciate what you are doing she made one simple requesta request that the entire house democratic caucus has been making i hope you can settle down and get a vote i dare the speaker to call her back and tell her sorry we are trying to gain consensus some members still have reservations sorry reelection support from the nra is more important than addressing

were shot in chicago three of the victims were children including two young cousins 8 and 5 years old who were shot while celebrating with their family on one street someone put a handmade sign that read dont shoot kids at play the stories of children caught in the middle of the ongoing gun violence epidemic are seemingly endless just last week dantignay brashear was walking down the street in chicago with her 4yearold son kavan when he was shot in the face speaking about the shooting the next day dantignay said he was with me he was holding my hand she thought he was safe we cannot accept the status quo when children are unsafe walking down the street holding their mothers hand kavan survived but his mother said how am i going to explain to him when he looks in the mirror and sees his face i wonder how do we explain to kavan and his mother that this house refused to take action to prevent this from happening to him or to any other child 1115 inaction in the face of these daily tragedies is simply not acceptable anymore chicago and illinois are trying to respond to this crisis but we need federal action chicago has increased its police presence law enforcement takes an illegal gun off the streets of chicago every 75 minutes illinois has enacted reasonable gun violence prevention measures there is no way for chicago or illinois to keep up with the influx of guns that are coming from across state lines sixty percent of the firearms used in chicago gun crimes come from out of state most come from just one state indiana the bloodshed in chicago doesnt start with the pull of a trigger it starts when the gun is purchased without necessary precautions in indiana no license or permit is required to purchase a gun there is no registration of weapons there is no waiting period to purchase a gun there are no restrictions on assault weapons any individual can take advantage of the lack of gun violence prevention laws in indiana and they do individuals purchase firearms at gun shows with no background checks at all and drive them back to chicago across the state line where they wind up on our city streets no state can address the gun violence epidemic alone

cant stay silent any longer each day eight people are shot in chicago the american people are demanding action and it is time that the house listened to them speaker ryan call the bills maybe they

dont have on my speed dial for regular conversations it was a couple of days after donald trump announced he was running for the republican nomination because he thought mexican immigrants were criminals drug dealers and rapists when it was my turn i told ms coulterand by extension mr trumpthat what they were saying about mexican immigrants would serve as a voter registration machine to turbocharge voter registration in the latino and immigrant community all because of their particularly mean andfrankly lets be honestracist attacks on mexican immigrants it was particularly important that i was in california for the show because i was watching the republican party make exactly the same mistake they made in the 1990s when it lost control of the politics in california by supporting extreme antiimmigrant policies to kick kids out of school and cut off families from being part of our society california went from a purple state that had given the republican party important leaders like richard nixon and ronald reagan and in just a few years was transformed into a deep shade of pacific blue why it is because millions of immigrants became citizens millions of immigrant citizens registered to vote and millions of registered voters voted to punish the republican party for being mean shortsighted and for offering demagoguery not real solutions to issues this brings me back to mr trump who is trying to be the standard bearer of the antiimmigrant wing of the republican party and trying to define the party as one that will fight against immigrants it sees as murderers drug dealers criminals and rapists jan brewer has endorsed trump and there he was this past weekend standing with joe arpaio in arizona democrats could not paint a clearer picture if we tried you should understand that when donald trump said mexican immigrants are criminals what do i and other puerto ricans hear i hear him saying all puerto ricans are criminals and as far as the republicans are concerned we all are millions of others herehondurans colombians and dominicansit is clear to all of us that what he is really saying is that all latinos are suspect whether we were born here or not look trumps stereotyping is nothing new every single wave of immigrants has met the same resistance they say they are lazy they are bringing crime and diseases that they are not like us and they are coming to kill our sons and rape our daughters whether you came to chicago from mexico a decade ago or from mississippi in the 1950s to escape jim crow you heard the same thing if you came to new york from ireland or came from sicily a century ago it has always been the same thing i say that latinos should do what the irish and the polish and the italians did become citizens and vote to my constituents and anyone today that is offended by what donald trump stands for i have a simple message become a citizen hazte ciudadano there are more than 8 8 million immigrants who hold green cards and meet the residency requirements and are eligible to apply for citizenship today that includes about 5 million latinos who can apply to become citizens today let me fill you in on a little secret with fee waivers up to 20 percent of all of those 8 8 million will pay absolutely nothing for their citizenship application becoming a citizen for free so you can make it clear that you are offended by donald trump it is poetic and patriotic rather than renew your green card for 450 become a citizen for about 230 more or zero if you are part of the 20 percent look almost all of the immigrants in this country are going to remain in this country until the day they die lets be honest for the millions who meet the requirements of citizenship i say take the step learn the language learn our history and how our government works and take the test every time you see trumps face on your tv vow to learn a little more english or a few more history facts so you can take the citizenship test lets turn the ignorance and the hatred of a tv personality running for president and turn it into something that strengthens democracy for all americans you know what if millions of people naturalize become citizens and we add to that the million latino citizens who this year will turn 18 plus all of our allies in the african american community the lgbt voters younger voters environmental voters women voters asian voters and union voters that are being pushed away by the republican party all the people they dont want in their coalition constitute a majority of americans together we are the

grown to nearly 50 000 signatures and it keeps on growing this is just the latest petition from momsrising urging congress to prioritize children in the budget and protect snap from cuts and other structural changes i want to share one of the stories from a mom monique from ohio writes i was raised to always work and so was my husband we have tried to instill this in our daughter even going so far as to work opposite shifts and have family babysit if there was an overlap when my husband was laid off 2 years ago and then couldnt find work i tried my best to keep us floating on just my income walking to work because i didnt have the bus fare often having 20 or less after paying the bills to feed my family for a week i resisted getting on welfare having been raised never to take a handout my pastor was the one who pointed out that i had already paid for that right through my taxes over several decades since signing up for snap benefits i can feed my family filling nutritious meals again of course my husband is still looking for work and that will pick up the slack again if he gets work and once he finds it we will happily forego the benefits again until then all i can say is thank god and the government for having a safety net in place unfortunately moniques story is not unique but it shows that without snap her family would have been much worse off during these tough times one in five children in the united states experiences hunger without the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap that number would sadly be much higher already nearly half of all snap participants are children under the age of 18nearly half this is despite the fact that snap households with children have high work rates families with children who are working continue to earn so little that they still qualify for snap and they will struggle to put food on the table we know that hunger can lead to a myriad of negative outcomes for children from health problems and compromised immune systems to poor nutrition to an inability to concentrate and succeed in school childhood hunger means kids suffer despite these sobering statistics the republican budget resolutions passed by the house and senate made draconian cuts to snap and other critical programs to help poor children and their families the budget conference report only makes these cuts worse it builds upon the 125 billion cut to snap in the house budget to achieve a cut of that magnitude by block granting the program and capping its allotment means that states would be forced to cut benefits or cut eligible individuals and families off the program there are simply no good choices in short it would make hunger worse in america much worse snap is one of the only remaining basic protections for the very poor for many of the poorest americans snap is the only form of income assistance they receive snap provides food benefits to lowincome americans at a very basic level snap benefits are already too low they average less than 1 40 per person per meal we should not be balancing the federal budget on the backs of the poor and working families we should not be making childhood hunger worse in america i commend momsrising for their leadership and for taking action to protect snap and ensure that all children have access to healthy nutritious foods later today momsrising will start a twitterstorm under the missionpossible to highlight how building a strong economy for women families and the nation is mission possible with policies to protect snap promote healthy nutrition

tyranny of the majority to act on gun violence prevention measurestheir deliberate inaction in the face of 33 000 deaths caused by gun violence every year we came to demand substantive action to address our countrys epidemic of gun violence yet today we will be presented with legislation promoted by the nra that fails to address this serious problem h r 4237 does not close or otherwise address the terror gap that allows known or suspected terrorists in the united states to legally buy guns instead this bill handicaps law enforcement creating an impossibly burdensome process and allowing terrorists to take advantage of the charleston loophole in fact h r 4237 doesnt just leave the loophole open which led to the loss of nine lives at the emanuel ame church it reinforces it and the terror gap under this legislation to prevent the transfer of a firearm the government will be required to file an emergency petition schedule a hearing provide the suspect with notice and counsel and win the hearing all within 72 hours of the attempted purchase and even if the government is able to win the hearing it can only prevent the transfer if the court finds that the suspected terrorist committed attempted to or will commit an act of terrorism put another way the government can only prevent a gun sale to a suspected terrorist if they can arrest the person for terrorist activity within 3 days of an attempted purchase ultimately this legislation does not provide any meaningful safeguards to prevent terrorists from purchasing guns sadly it is nothing more than a political tactic to avoid responsibility a contrived effort to look busy and feign concern while thousands of americans lose their lives to gun violence the american people are smarter than this we have a moral responsibility to do something meaningful the american people demand that we do more that we do something that we do anything to help prevent another mass tragedy in this country make no mistake this legislation falls short of a goodfaith effort to save lives the gao found that individuals on the terrorist watch list were able to pass a background check and legally purchase a firearm 2 043 times between february of 2004 and december of 2014 the fbi was only able to prevent 10 percent of these purchases as we all unfortunately learned on june 12 when we fail to prevent dangerous individuals from getting their hands on guns we put the lives of americans at risk but there is legislation that the house can consider that will reduce gun violence first h r 1076 the no fly no buy bill would effectively close the terror gap by providing the department of justice with the discretion to block gun sales to terrorist suspects it will preserve due process for individuals who were mistakenly listed to appeal their denial second h r 1217 would implement universal background checks for all commercial gun sales it is a measure supported by the overwhelming majority of the american people and empirical research shows that universal background checks for all handgun sales have lowered levels of gun violence in those states where that occurs nationally 34 percent of gun sales and 40 percent of all gun transfers occur without a background check this legislation would represent an important step toward closing this loophole and reducing gun violence i urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to bring these two bills to the floor to respond to the demands of the american people to do something about the pandemic of gun violence to do something meaningful that will actually reduce gun violence in this country and protect the american people as we are sworn to do i know i speak for all of my colleagues in the democratic caucus we will continue to fight in every way that

authorization for the land and water conservation fund expires that date is a looming date for the republican leadership of this house with it comes the talk and potential of a government shutdown other critical programs that face reauthorization are also ending on september 30 part of the issue of leadership is to allow the house to work its will until this house has the opportunity to deal with this issue of the land and water conservation fund we will continue to not know its status and we will watch the agonizingly slow and painful dismantling and end of this program the reauthorization has in its history been bipartisan and bicameral this legislation enjoys bipartisan and bicameral support both republican and democratic colleagues are part of the 165 sponsors of the legislation in the house the compromise in that committee was between the ranking member and the chair of that committee in the senate so i think it behooves us to look at this fund for every day past the 30th of september 2 5 million will be lost to that fund money that we cannot afford to lose to wait for the ashes of the land and water conservation fund after the 30th and then to develop it without bipartisan input without the democrats playing any role at all in legislation that redefines the fund and that includes purposes for which the fund was never established and redirect its funds into areas which are far from the mission of the fund when it was established 50 years ago is effectively killing the fund the cuts in our federal land agencies and land management agencies that have endured in the last four or five budgets point to the fact that the land and water conservation fund has become an essential supplemental support to many of our public lands and the projects and outdoor activities and wildlife protections that the american people expect i suggest to the house that this reauthorization should be devoid of controversy and should be devoid of partisan bickering and political grandstanding this is a routine item that requires action by the house before the time runs out fully funding and fully authorizing the land and water conservation fund on a permanent basis is what the public is asking for and is what 165 members of this house are asking for i believe that the republican leadership of this house has to act and allow the house of representatives the elected representatives of the people of this nation to work its will and take that vote my colleagues have mentioned the economic benefit and priorities of the land and water conservation fund let me just add that a bipartisan poll found that 88 percent of the voters support continuing to set aside offshore oil and gas drilling fees that should go into the land and water conservation fund and 85 percent of americans want the fund to be fully funded for every dollar that is spent on land and water conservation funds and that is invested it results in a return of 4 in economic value from the natural resources goods and services alone i think it is worth noting that 900 million comes from those offshore oil and gas resources and 17 billion that is collected from those fees and resources that are collected from offshore drilling and gas and oil development goes for other purposes elsewhere in the government so we are talking essentially about a very small sum of money that many of us felt should have been raised a long time ago we are jeopardizing this sum of money in jeopardizing this sum of money we are further dismantling and further hurting the publics use of our public lands and more importantly the protections and cultural resource activities that occur as a result of the fund it is a simple matter bring it to a hearing bring it to a vote i would urge the leadership of this house that it is way past time to agonizingly wait for september 30 is not a function of government it is cynical it is wrong when you have a bill before you that enjoys the bipartisan support

have observed on this house floor because of gun violence most important zero zero that is the number of votes that this house has taken to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people what is the majority so afraid of is their fear greater than the fear of those young kids at sandy hook or those parishioners in charleston or those young people at the nightclub in orlando it is long past time for the house to give us a vote on meaningful legislation to make sure that terrorists criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill dont have easy access to guns in our country there is

background checks for all commercial gun sales background checks are our first line of defense when it comes to stopping dangerous people from getting firearms they work every day more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives are stopped from buying a gun because of background checks but in 34 states criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill can bypass the background check by purchasing guns online at a gun show or through an ad in the paper this is a dangerous loophole that needs to be closed and it needs to be closed now the bill has 186 bipartisan coauthors bring our bill up for a vote there is absolutely no reason why anyone should oppose this background check bill not only is it bipartisan it respects the second amendment rights of lawabiding citizens i am a gun guy i own guns i support the second amendment if this bill did anything to violate those rights my name wouldnt be on it all this background check bill does is require that folks pass a background check before purchasing guns online at a gun show or through an ad plain and simple it does nothing to infringe on the second amendment right of lawabiding citizens to own firearms

washington that is out of step with america or is it the most vocal most active and most vitriolic elements of the republican base that are out of step with america last weeks nbc news wall street

want to go for most americans mad men was a good tv drama set before racial integration before the womens movement really took hold before gays and lesbians dared come out of the closet and before we removed racial quotas from immigration but some in the republican party aspire to turn it into a reality tv show the latest throwdown from the right has been over planned parenthood and reimbursing this respected organization for health services it provides to women across the country in many cases planned parenthood is the only source of affordable and accessible reproductive health care contraception hiv and std testing cancer screenings and basic health care for women under federal law our tax dollars cannot pay for abortions and there are no credible claims that this is being violated under law abortion is legal in the united states despite all of the restrictions imposed and proposed by my republican colleagues but this goes further than abortion rights and a womans right

have to force them into back alleys or across state lines for health care or to treat them as if only wise men in washington can make decisions for the women of america but that desire to turn the

others well with all due respect to mr carson and emperor trump every poll indicates that the american people are not with them and that is especially true of young people in america dr carson must be nostalgic for the anticatholic days before john kennedy was elected because he is now raising doubts that people of certain religions are qualified to serve their country as president senator cruz must look at the old days when we turned away refugees from europe because of their religion as we did in the 1930s and 1940s when antisemitism gripped this country now he wants to send muslims back to die in syria and now there is donald trump he wants to deport about a quarter of the 50 million latinos in the united states if mass deportation was good enough for president eisenhower he feels it should be good enough for america today i will agree with one leading candidate jeb bush who recently said that stuff happens stuff does happen a lot of stuff has happened since the 1950s when i was born and the 1960s when i grew up in america our laws and our culture have evolved to become more inclusive and we have a more diverse and egalitarian society because of it many republicans call that

congressional budget office that apparently what our republican colleagues worked so hard to do was to take affordable health care away from 22 million americans at the same time we have heard all sorts of misinformation and distortions on this floor about planned parenthood which is an organization that provides women and their families with health care that provides cancer screenings and that provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of other committees here yet our republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt special committee to go after planned parenthood ironically they claim to be doing an investigation but here on the floor they have obviously already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an organization that helps provide health care to american women and families so rolled into one bill you have something that would deny access to health care to 22 million americans and at the same time deny important health services to millions of american women and their families when our republican colleagues pose this question and say that the president is going to be faced with a tough choice i can assure them it is not a tough choice for the president because it is not a tough choice when it comes to whether or not we take affordable health care away from 22 million americans that should be an easy choice for all of us we are not going to do it it also shouldnt be a tough choice as to whether or not we defund planned parenthood and the services they provide to american women and families that is not going to be a tough choice for the president the republican leader was absolutely right when he talked about the consequences of the 2016 elections because we are fortunate that today we have a president who will not sign that bill but who will instead veto that bill our colleagues are absolutely right if you had a different president including as far as i know all of them on the republican side they would be signing this bill so this is an important statement of what our republican colleagues think is the top priority on the first day of 2016 which is to get rid of affordable health care for 22 million americans lets talk about that with the american public because i believe that the american public wants to do what the gentleman from massachusetts said where we find problems and where we need to make adjustments we should do it but we shouldnt turn back the clock and deny affordable health care to tens of millions of americans i yield back the

as saying you believe the two parties can achieve consensus on that legislation but we may not be able to move it forward this year excuse me that speaks to criminal justice system reform not to voting rights i think we can reach consensus on the criminal justice reform i think both parties believe that there are substantial areas that need to be addressed in criminal justice reform senator cornyn has certainly indicated that republicans and democrats in this house have indicated that my question to you is with respect to the issues that i think we have all discussed and that the speaker has discussed such as jobs and economic growth health care poverty and opportunity which we believe is a very important issue criminal justice reform job creation longterm fiscal agreements so that we can replace the sequester with a permanent rather than an every2year resolution comprehensive tax reform which almost all of us have said we are formr camp brought a bill forward on thatcomprehensive immigration reform restoring voting rights which i mentioned taking action to address gun violence which we are in favor of and i think clearly your side has indicated that mental health is very much a component of that and you want to address that and addressing our national security challenges which i agree with the speaker that is a primary responsibility and concern of i think everybody on the floor of this house my question therefore mr leader is do you expect any substantive legislation rather than simply ideas that both parties might express and put out to the public that would be
