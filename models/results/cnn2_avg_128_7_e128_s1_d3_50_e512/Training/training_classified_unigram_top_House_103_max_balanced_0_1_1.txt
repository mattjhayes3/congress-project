{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "it is with great sadness that i rise as the chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus to mourn the death of cesar chavez for more than three decades cesar chavez symbolized the voice for political awareness among latinos he carried the cry for farm workers rights to the fields of california and echoed the call for la causa the struggle to raise political consciousness and deliver justice to all latinos with every breath cesar chavez brought passion to his quest for justice but his triumphs sharpened the bittersweet taste of organizing and unionizing the migrant workers a step forward in the march was often matched by a step backward success often mixed with suffering it was in 1962 that cesar chavez took out his life savings and first organized the national farm workers association in the san joaquin valleys agricultural town of delano by september of the same year the nfwa held its first formal meeting in fresno with 287 participants who came to listen to the powerful ideas of the farm workers rights movement lead by the inspiration of cesar chavez along the thousands of miles traveled through the california farm land chavez brought the message of farm workers unity and unionization during the late 1960s and early 1970s the ufws membership reached its peak with over 70 000 members in 1975 chavez delivered his most important legacy to the farm workers rights movement successfully campaigning for the landmark agricultural labor relations act which permitted farm workers to organize and bargain collectively for the first time the grape pickers struggle took center stage in what chavez called la huelgaa series of strikes a call for adequate living conditions and higher wages and a stop to the exploitation and injustice suffered by latinos chavez is also responsible for one of the first and largest consumer boycotts persuading millions of consumers to voluntarily abstain from buying california grapes the boycott gave consumers an active role in opposing the injustices against farm workers across the country throughout his life cesar chavez brought to the public eye the existence of mexicanamericans as a growing and vibrant population more than just the political movement chavez created a moral spiritual and cultural world for mexicanamericans to explore with each and every march chavez continued to challenge all mexicanamericans to engage in an active search for their own cultural identity by the 1970s the term chicanismo the identification of latinos of mexican decent as a symbiosis of hispanic indigenous and american culturesfirst appeared in the lingo of the time chicano art brought nourishment to the spirit of farm workers and to urban life cesar chavez was the inspiration for the teatro campesino which made its debut at the picket lines among the farm workers it was luis valdez agustin lira and others that colored with music and drama with the fight chavez would come to epitomize chavez gave writers painters and other artists the strength and inspiration to express the chicano and latino struggle for equality he gave latinos a voice a spirit and a dream the means to speak a common language through the words of the working poor cesar chavez spoke in a language that was as dear to puerto ricans as it was to mexicanamericans i recall my late father who had walked the picket line on behalf of the sheet metal workers in the bronx it was my father who often expressed to me and my brother that the one power the working poor have is the right to strike it was with these ideas that cesar chavez became part of the puerto rican struggle in the east coast chavez encountered many impediments throughout his struggle but fought his opponent only through words and nonviolent philosophy in 1969 chavez said if the strike means the blood of one grower or one growers son or one worker or one workers son then it isnt worth it in 1968 chavez began a 25day fast chavez explained his actions by saying it was an act of penance recalling workers to the nonviolent roots of their movement even though his fasting lead to physical deterioration it powerfully communicated the hunger for dignity of the farm worker to every one present today and for the thousands of farm workers in the united states it is difficult to express through words the sorrow felt throughout this nation like martin luther king jr who organized africanamericans in the south to stand up against injustice and discrimination cesar chavez stood up against injustice and discrimination cesar chavez stood up against oppression and exploitation in the agricultural fields of california but chavezs greatest accomplishment was to unite the latinos in this country who are children of the earth share the common land to sow and with one united voice await the season when justice may be reaped for the betterment of all as a humble voice among latinos i take great pride in honoring the memory of cesar chavez in memory of you cesar we pledge to keep your voice alive and with your words i make the call viva la huelga viva la causa viva la union thank you cesar you will never be forgotten i yield to the gentleman from new mexico"], [4.804658407242535e-11, 4.804658407242535e-11, 0, "i hope the members back in their offices are listening they ought to get over here on this floor and watch because the american people are watching and you are about to witness one of the most outrageous charades ever attempted on the floor of this house here are 432 pages of testimony of conscientious members of this house republicans and democrats who have been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership 40some denied their rights on the floor of this house you are about to see the taxers the spenders the regulators who control this house the democrat leadership attempt to convince you and the american people that the bill that pays for the operation of this congress has been substantially reduced i get so exercised when i see this mr speaker and members that is an outrageous charade this bill does not reduce spending on we the congress it does not reduce spending by 20 percent by 10 percent by 5 percent not even 2 percent this bill authorizes spending on we the congress of 1 800 000 000 almost 2 billion and yes the taxers and the spenders and the regulators who run this place have magnanimously cut this legislative budget by about 1 percent well isnt that big of them what do you think about that mr and mrs america typically president clinton and the democrat leadership are attempting to foist on the american people the largest tax increase in american history forcing each american family to cough up at least 800 per year in new taxes forcing every american family to tighten their belts yet these same democrats continue on their drunken spending spree refusing to cut their own budgets and even worse through this gag rule refusing to let rankandfile republicans and democratsand here they are democrats look at them you have been slapped by your democrat leadershiprefusing to allow republicans or democrats to even offer amendments that would significantly cut our legislative budget why is this a charade it is a charade because the democrat leadership in an 11thhour rules meeting yesterday kidded 40some members democrats and republicans alikehere they arewho came to us pleading to let them offer significant cutting amendments to the bill why is this a charade mr speaker because after listening to all of these members recite what their constituents were saying back home cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending the democratcontrolled rules committee turned down on a partyline vote all 46 of the significant cutting amendments offered by republicans and democrats alike amendments that would have cut several hundred million dollars from this bloated legislative expense budget that continues to hire 37 000 employees which i think is lust to make us look good why is this a charade mr speaker because after refusing to allow any of the significant cutting amendments to be offered and debated on this floor the democrat leadership in a cute little ployand you just heard it recited by the manager herein a cute little ploy made in order six small amendments have you people listened to it up there do you know what those six small amendments were for they were good amendments but none of them individually or in total significantly reduce this legislative budget to show you what a charade this gag rule really is and why i am so exercised and why the american people are going to be so exercised if all six of these amendments pass all six that were magnanimously made in order which my good friend the gentleman from texas has said they were really gracious in allowing all these amendments if all six were allowed to pass they would not even cut our legislative budget by a tenth of 1 percent that means that congress this year will continue to spend on itself almost the same amount that it always has while socking it to the taxpayers of this nation to portray this legislative budget as a costcutting bill is a charade the american people have had enough they have had it with a congress that continues to raise their taxes so that they can spend the money on themselves that is exactly what we are doing here they have had it with a congress that continues to pass laws that regulate the american people but exempt the congress exempt themselves they have had it with you they have had it with a democrat leadership that refuses to allow rank and file republicans or democrats to offer amendments that would do what their constituents sent them here to do this year cut spending cut spending cut spending i cannot say it enough cut spending especially cut spending on themselves mr speaker and members i urge defeat of the rule so that democrats like the gentleman from minnesota a good conservative democrat most conscientious member on your side of the aisle and another democrat the gentleman from utah another very good member who has been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership and refused to be able to come on this floor and offer their significant amendments that would cut millions out of this budget and lord knows we can afford to cut millions out of this budget so that our republican leader the gentleman from illinois could offer his amendment which could cut anywhere between 12 and 25 percent you know they deserve the right to be able to come to this floor and do that mr speaker and members of this house that is what the american people want but it is what the democrat leadership does not want members who are you for are you for the democrat leadership or are you for the american people on behalf of the american people vote down this rule and let these members come on this floor and do what they were sent here to do represent their people i include the

today by bill clinton and the democrat majority in congress the budget proposal offered by the democrats is a recipe for economic and fiscal disaster it proposes to increase taxes at a time when americans are already overtaxed it proposes to increase taxes at a itime when we have a fragile economy higher taxes will only stifle job creation and economic growth it proposes to continue the path of excessive govemnment spending excessive spending is the reason our federal government is currently saddled with a massive debt depending on whose estimates you believe bill clinton is proposing to raise taxes anywhere from 250 billion to 315 billion no matter which figure you use if his proposal becomes law it will be the largest tax increase in the history of our nation moreover egardless of the exact figures his proposal taxes everyone from the small business owner to the social security recipient to the working middle income american family and we thought mr clinton was only going to sock it to the rich it is an absolute outrage that a man who actually promised middle american taxpayers a tax cut during the campaign can now turn around and unblushingly pr6pose to raise taxes in a magnitude of historic proportions mr clintons assertion that the reason he must now raise taxes is because the deficit figure is higherthan he anticipated during the campaign is quite frankly bull in fact last july during the campaign clinton predicted even higher deficitsup to 40u billionthan actually materialized moreover democrat budget committee members advising clinton during the campaign and working with their good friends at the congressional budget office certainly were well aware of what to expect in the way of deficit figures most conspicuous among those members is leon panetta former chairman of the housebudget committee and now clintons director of office of management and budget for clinton to rationalize raising taxes based on claims of new deficit figures is the height of hypocrisy this is just another example of mr clinton trying to be slick more importantly regardlessof what the actual deficit figures are t is excessive spending not insufficient tax revenues that has produced our gushing red ink indeed when you combine federal state and local taxes you find that the american taxpayer is already being taxed at alltime record high levels analyzing the federal budget over the past 12 years further drives home thepoint in 1980 revenues to the federal treasury were 500 billion by 1992 revenues had soared to 1 1 trillion a massive 600 billion increase in 12 years in other words in 12 years the american taxpayer shouldered an additional federal tax burden that was greater than the magnitude of the entire tax burden it took us over 200 years to reach one would think that the federal government could do just fine with 600 billion in new tax dollars each year but alas it isnt enough to quench the insatiable thirst of democrats in congress during that same timeframe federal expenditures rose frem 600 billion to nearly 1 4 trillionan increase of 800 billion this simply illustrates the historical fact that for every new dollar the treasury receives in taxes congress spends 1 60 more indeed the 1990 budget deal which had promised spending cuts for every dollar in new taxes instead resulted in congress spending an additional 2 37 for every dollar in new taxes republicans have been willing to make the hard choices and make the spendlng cuts how many times in the past 12 years have i seen this congress on a party ing vote reject republican amendments to trim as little as 1 percent from an appropriation bill how many times have i seen the democratcontrolled rules committee decide to prevent republlcant from offering amendments to cut spending and make economies indeed in that regard i was deeply disappointed that the democrats did not allow my good friend from indiana congressman dan burton to offer his budget freeze proposal i have long been an advocate of an across the board spending freeze mr burrons proposal would have made a bigger dent in the deficit than any of the proposals before us today moreover in my view mr burtons acrosstheboard freeze is the fairest way to spread the burden of spending cutseveryone who benefits from federal spending must tighten the belt however once again in an abuse of their uninterrupted control of the house of representatives for the past 40 years the democrats decided to gag the opposition rather than debate a viable alternative on its merits republicans have proposed viable alternatives and the budget proposal offered by my good fmlend john kasich is the kind of proposal that the american public deserves it proposes no tax increases and will cut the deficit significantly i can only hope that there are democrats in the house that can see the error of mr clintons ways and join republicans in supporting the kasich budget bill clinton has broken his promise to the american people as he has broken so many other promises in his short tenure mr clinton does not understad one basic factamericans are not undertaxedcongress is spending too much in my view bil clinton sold the american voter a bill of goods i am afraid that this president who received only 43 percent of the popular vote and this congress do not understand the nature of the problem as bill clinton should say its spending stupid"], [1.3994752912083186e-08, 1.3994752912083186e-08, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume my colleagues democrats and republicans alike fellow americans this is the showdown right now i voted for the amendment offered by the gentleman from ohio like a great many of my colleagues did over here and i was proud to do so but now that the kasich budget is no longer an option to this body my colleagues should know that this is the very last chance that democrats and republicans will have to strip the clinton proposal as i said before i was proud to vote for the kasich budget i am sorry it did not pass but now that it is no longer an option this is the very last chance that democrats on that side and republicans on this side will have to strip the clinton proposal of two of the most onerous and unfair taxes that this body could possibly levy on middleclass taxpayers and senior citizens and that is the btu energy tax that will drastically reduce the cost of food and gasoline and home heating fuel and every single piece of manufactured goods in america on our constituents and it will strip out the clinton social security tax increase that almost doubles the social security tax on retired american citizens you do mot want to do that why is this the last chance because if my amendment is defeated on this floor now your vote against my amendment guarantees that this unfair energy tax and the unfair social security tax will become law and your vote did it if members want to vote for this solomon consensus let me tell what it does first of all this solomon consensus will not raise taxes one dime it cuts taxes the clinton budget calls for 366 billion in new taxes andwe in the sol omon consensus cut taxes by 222 billion 222 billion by eliminating the increase in the energy tax by eliminating the social security tax by eliminating the corporate income tax and we cut president clintons tax increase further by changing his new tax bracket from 140 000 up to 200 000 of adjusted gross income before it kicks in that is a taxcut not a tax increase to stimulate the economy we provide for vital tax incentives we cut taxes further not raise them by extending expiring business tax incentives by restoring real estate passive loss that almost bankrupted the real estate industry in this country b years ago by providing capital gains tax deductions for startup companies which is badly needed and by repealing the luxury tax on boats that most members on that side of the aisle have sponsored and just about everybody on this side of the aisle has sponsored here is your chance to vote for it including the gentleman from michigan my good friend that cuts 222 billion out of the clinton tax increases leaving only this and i do not address this but it leaves in the clinton budget a surtax on millionaires it leaves some miscellaneous taxes to plug business expense loopholes and it leaves a limit on deductions for executive pay over 1 million if there is anything that could be construed as an income tax increase in this substitute here it is this we expand that limit of 1 million on executive pay to include movie stars and professional athletes who make 200 times what the average assembly line worker makes at ge in my district or general motors in your district two hundred times if members vote for the solomon amendment they remove the middleclas tax increase and put fairness back into the unitedstates tax code besides fairness the most important other issue in this budget and facing this congress and this nation is reducing the unconscionable deficit that is drowning this nation in a sea of red ink unfortunately the clinton budget even after raising taxes by 336 billion does little or nothing to reduce spending or to reduce that deficit over 5 years president clintons budget only cuts spending 219 billion with practically no cuts in the first 2 years and no procedures to guarantee that we get any cuts in the last 3 years members know we will not without grammrudman restrictions in there here is the real difference between the two bills the solomon plan more than doubles the clinton cuts cutting 265 billion more than clinton and it guarantees those cuts by requiring sequestration procedures that trigger acrosstheboard cuts if this congress exceeds these budget limits these cuts totaling more than 485 billion guarantee that we will reduce the deficit by a whopping 820 billion that is 150 billion more than president clinton and the democrat budget over there that is real deficit reduction and it is real tax fairness speaking of fairness remember as i said in the beginning this is your absolute last chance to remove the unjust energy tax and the grossly unjust social security tax off the backs of the american people who can least afford it members should not let their vote and i am talking about democrat members over there and their votes over here republicans be the one that saddles these taxes on the american people if they do they ought to be ashamed of themselves members should support this substitute because their constituents will thank them for doing it

investigation into vince fosters death but there is a lot of other interesting things that have happened involving the rose law firm in little rock ar and hillary rodham clinton and the former governor of arkansas bill clinton tonight i would like to talk about two cases involving the failure of two savings and loans and the involvement of the rose law firm and some possible conflicts of interest that should be investigated by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the federal savings and loan insurance corporation as well as the special counsel mr starr first american savings and loan of oak brook il was seized by the federal authorities for the federal government in 1986 first american savings and loan of oak brook was headed by former illinois gov dan walker dan lasater a friend of bill clinton had a brokerage business united capital corp and it traded treasury bond futures for first federal savings and loan of illinois and others dan lasater ran a brokerage firm in little rock ar he was a big contributor to bill clintons gubernatorial campaigns he was a friend of bill clinton and he flew clinton around in his private jet lasater gave roger clinton bill clintons brother a job and loaned him 8 000 to pay off a drug debt lasaters brokerage firm received a lucrative contract from the government of arkansas worth 750 000 to sell state bonds for a new arkansas state police communications network he also received millions of dollars in bonds for the arkansas development financial authority in 1986 lasater was convicted on drug charges this is bill clintons good friend he served only part of his sentence and he was pardoned after serving a small part of his sentence by then gov bill clinton in 1985 dan walker the former governor of illinois discovered that first american savings and loan was losing money big time on its treasury bond future trades with dan lasater according to court records mr walker lost approximately 361 000 walker claims that lasater made unauthorized trades with first federals money and walker told the chicago tribune they lasater co had general authority to trade but they were supposed to call the first american operating officer at the time they made the trade and they did not do that walker sued lasater for 3 3 million for mail wire and securities fraud the suit charged that one of lasaters employees used first federals money to carry out what were in effect personal treasury bill trades does this sound familiar members heard me on the floor not long ago talking about a gentleman named dennis patrick from kentucky he had a similar story according to mr patrick in published accounts between 60 million and 107 million was traded in an account in his name at lasater co without mr patricks knowledge they traded 60 million to 107 million in bond trades in his account and he did not even know about it on 1 day 23 million was traded on his account without his knowledge now when federal regulators the fslic the federal savings and loan insurance corporation seized first american of illinois they continued to pursue the lawsuit against lasater they wanted to recover as much money as they possibly could dan walker the former governor of illinois was accused of lending himself 1 4 million in federally insured depositors money and later ended up being convicted of bank fraud and perjury hopkins sutter i know this is very complicated but hopkins sutter a chicago law firm was the primary contractor or law firm for the federal savings and loan insurance corporation hopkins sutter hired or subcontracted with a law firm in little rock ar called the rose law firm to handle the suit against lasater i hope everybody will think about this my colleagues lasater co mr lasater was a very close friend of bill clinton he flew around in his private jet they went on parties together lasater was convicted along with bill clintons brother of drug dealing lasater paid one of bill clintons brothers drug loans of 8 000 and after lasater was convicted he was pardoned by then gov bill cliiton rose law firm is hired as a subcontractor for the purpose of the suit against lasater they are going to go after lasater and hillary rodham clinton and vince foster were the two lawyers from the law firm the rose law firm to go after mr lasater think about that for a minute they are going after lasater for the federal government at the same time that he is a very good friend of gov bill clinton and has been pardoned for drug trafficking by the governor dan lasater was convicted of drug charges in 1986 as i said and served only a small part of his sentence and was later pardoned by the governor now president clinton now enter hillary rodham clinton rose law firms powerhouse lawyer and vince foster they handled the governments suit against lasater it is hard to believe this conflict of interest could occur but they are handling the case against lasater bill clintons friend because of the close ties between lasater and bill and hillary clinton she never should have been involved in this matter in any way that is a big conflict of interest in late 1987 a confidential settlement was reached between the government and lasater he ended up paying 200 000 of the 3 3 million suit that is all just 200 000 the chicago tribune learned of the amount of the settlement from a february 1989 letter that foster wrote to the fdic the letter was not part of the court filings court records show that hillary rodham clinton and vince foster negotiated this settlement from 3 3 million down to 200 000 it started on may 8 1987 when hillary rodham clinton signed an amended complaint on this case that reduced the damages sought by the fslic against lasater from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million she negotiated the reduction of this down from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million for the fdic at a time when the guy lasater she was supposed to be nailing to the wall was a good friend of she and bill clinton the governor of arkansas the fdic said hillarys involvement tvas not extensive enough to constitute a conflict of interest this sounds like a whitewash by the fdic and to cover their tails the fdic said under federal rules existing at the time she did not have to inform the federal government about her close relationship with lasater and lasaters company the fdic said hillary worked only 3 houi s on the case they said she was not involved in the final decision to settle at 200 000 the fdic says vince foster did most of the work on this case he was her partner at rose the fslic that hired hillary and vince foster and the rose law firm could not remember details of the case the fdics earlier inquiry was primarily a review of court records and records submitted by the rose law firm the fdic did not interview i lary rodham clinton because of the apparent fdic wh wash in late february sena alfonse damato of new york questd the fdic acting chairm andrew hove to

has a political financial personal relationship and make no mistake about it i lary rodham clinton and bill clin had a very close relationship lasater and this was not made kn when hillary rodham clinton took that case in looking at the settlem he went on were they the rose law firm and hil rodham clinton looking after lasaters terests or the interests of the federal posit insurance corporation actually the federal savings loan insurance corporation scc told the chicago tribune that hill rodham clinton should not h worked on the case especially si the final settlement was confidentia william wernz a former chairmai the minnesota lawyers responsibi board for the minneapolis tribune s that the bar association model r define as conflict of interest instan where it is likely a lawyer might pull a punch because he or she some relationship with the other side some third party of interest law and accounting firms are usu barred from representing the federal c eminent in s l cases if they have per ally represented the s l or if they have sonal links to the persons targeted by lawsuit and that was specifically the case 4 lasater and company dan lasater a friend of

clinton a and loaned him a large sum of moi 1l to pay drug debts and after lasater was convicted on drug charges and ite served a small part of his sentence tor then gov bill clinton pardoned him re yet his wife hillary rodham clinan ton who knew lasater very well took ec the side of the government in the case iew against lasater reduced the settleity ment from 3 3 million down to 200 000 to and the fslic was literally screwed ort out of all of that money from 3 3 milin lion down to 200 000 there was defiber nitely a conflict of interest that she wn did not let the american people know not or the fslic know about re here is a related problem home fedthe eral savings and loan of centralia il was was also seized by federal regulators and home federals former president king ir 8 betz sued lasater and company for d a 4 6 million for unauthorized trading has he chose the rose law firm to handle re his suit and hillary rodham clinton and was a big partner in that law firm and he chose the rose law firm to handle ant his suit because the issues involved iics were similar to the issues in first aw american hi after the federal government took over home federal the federal govter ernment continued the case and they 3ub had the rose law firm carrying the ney case for them op thomas mars represented lasater on om the other side of the table against the and home federal federal government suit so you had on one side of the table hil the rose law firm of which hillary ton rodham clinton was a partner like the ith case i just cited and on the other side wn was this guy named thomas mars on now where did he come from he had ent previously worked at the rose law firm so you have on one side of the lary table negotiating for the federal govin ernment the rose law firm and you de have a former lawyer in that same law firm representing lasater does that and sound like some conniving some pecur liar circumstances mars had preary viously worked at the rose law firm ave where he had worked on the american nce suit he worked on the first american 1 suit that i just talked about therei of fore he may have had some inside inlity formation on the governments case said since the case he worked on at the iles rose law firm was very similar ces king betz the man who started the case ip the first place for home federal has savings and loan was advised by or vince foster of the rose law firm to ally accept a 250 000 outofcourt settlekov ment in september of 1989 and he 3on agreed to the settlement but he did per not know that both sides of the table the were being worked by the rose law firm and a former lawyer who worked ith for the rose law firm wras king betz says that vince foster was rib handling his suit and never told him am about mars potential conflict of interton est or the clintons ties to lasater ar according to the chicago tribune her when betz was told that mars previously worked with foster and hillary job rodham in the first federal case for hey the rose law firm betz said he cant do that he could have confidential information but the cat was already out of the bag or in the bag because he had already signed off on the 250 000 settlement on a suit that was supposed to be for 4 6 million there are some questions that need to be answered by the rose law firm and by the fslic and the fdic concerning these two cases first when will the fdic inspector general issue its report on hillary rodham clinton first american and madison guaranty is this report being delayed until after the election it was ordered in february was supposed to be done in 90 days and here we are in september 7 weeks before the election and we still do not have the report why that needs to be done quickly r0 1800 now here are some questions that need to be answered by the fdic and the new independent counsel mr starr if he is investigating this and i think he probably will and in full and complete congressional investigations and hearings did hillary rodham clinton and or the rose law firm inform the federal government of her and her husbands ties to dan lasater i do not believe she did but we need to know if she did this is regarding the first american if they did not inform the government of their ties to dan lasater then why did they not because it was obviously conflict of interest to what extent was hillary rodham clinton involved in the suits they said it was only 2 or 3 hours but she signed or got the agreement to reduce the suit from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million so she was very conversant with it and very actively involved in it specifically what role did hillary rodham clinton have in the final decision tosettle the suit for 200 000 down from the 3 3 million if she was involved how were her actions affected by her ties to dan lasater and lasater co who was responsible for handling the case hillary rodham clinton vince foster or both obviously they were both partners in the rose law firm there had to be a conflict there who decided who would handle this case if vince foster was handling the case why was hillary rodham clinton involved at all we do know for sure the fdic has said that hillary rodham clinton signed the amended complaint reducing the damages sought from 3 3 million to 1 3 million now involving the home federal case why was not king betz the chairman there told about thomas mars conflict of interest he was a former lawyer with the rose law firm defending lasater why was not betz told about the ties between the clintons and lasater was the fdic informed about any of this did thomas mars the former errfployee of the rose law firm use inside information to arseptember20 1994 co range a 250 000 settlement on an over 4 million original suit these are questions that need to be answered the more we get into the machinations of the clintons the more we find all kinds of chicanery from whitewater to madison savings loan to these two savings and loan institutions in illinois to the angel fire development in new mexico there are so many questions that need to be answered that is why we need full and complete congressional hearings not just the facade we saw with the committee on banking finance and urban affairs in the house just a few months ago the people of this country have a right to know if there is corruption in this government they have a right to know if hillary rodham clinton had a conflict of interest when she was representing these individuals for the fdic i mean her husband was the governor he was a friend of the man that she was supposed to be nailing to the wall and she reduced the claim from 3 3 million down to 200 000 there are all kinds of questions that need to be answered and the only way the people of this country are going to know the facts is for us to have complete and thorough congressional hearings and they need to be held as quickly as possible i commend to my colleagues the following february 3 1994 chicago tribune article the special prosecutor appointed to scrutinize the business dealings of the president and first lady will focus on their role in an ozark land development called whitewater but there is another case buried deep in court records that could prove equally troubling to bill and hillary rodham clinton particularly if robert fiske the republican special prosecutor and former unitedstates attorney in new york makes good on his pledge to publish a report on the clintons political and business relationships when the president was governor of arkansas in the 1980s it involves a court case the first lady helped settie when she was a highpowered lawyer in little rock and the government was trying to sort out the problems of a bankrupt illinois savings and loan the illinois s l case suggests that hillary clinton as a private attorney had a glaring conflict of interest as an attorney for the federal deposit insurance corp she helped negotiate a secret outofcourt settlement that ended the governments suit against a family friend and an influential benefactor of her husband but the political problems the case could pose for the president and his wife may go far beyond the narrow questions about the first ladys conduct as a lawyer which she defends as in whitewater the illinois case places the president and his wife once again in an association with an unsavory wheelerdealer who had strong personal ties to the clintons and even stronger financial ties to the clinton administration in little rock in whitewater the trouble stems from the clintons business relationship with james mcdougal the guiding force behind madison guaranty an arkansas savings and loan that went broke and cost taxpayers more than 47 million fiske will examine whether clinton or his gubernatorial campaign benefited from mcdougals favorable treatment by a state agency in arkansas when clinton was governor in the illinois case the problem stems from the clintons friendship with dan lasater a convicted felon whose highflying bond tradingfirm played a hand in the troubles of several savings and loans including first american savings and loan association an oak brook institution headed by another politician dan walker who was governor of illinois from 1973 to 1977 it all started in 1979 in an unlikely venuethe oaklawn park racetrack in hot springs ark clintons mother the late virginia kelley had a passion for thoroughbred horseracing and her box at the track was next to lasaters an arkansas native who grew up in poverty in kokomo ind lasater started a hamburger chain when he was 19 and was wealthy by the time he met mrs kelley and clintons halfbrother roger at the racetrack in just over twb decades lasater had sold his first hamburger chain moved to arkansas founded the ponderosa steakhouse a nationwide chain of 650 family restaurants started a bond trading firm and nurtured his love for horseracing the racetrack friendship soon blossomed into an introduction to clinton who was trying to regain the governors mansion after losing an election in 1980 according to a clinton family friend by early 1983 lasater had given roger clinton a job at his florida horse farm clinton had reclaimed the governors mansion and lasaters bond firm had been added to a list of brokerage firms eligible to underwrite state bond issues a classification that generated millions of dollars in business for his firm according to published reports over the next two years the ties between lasater and the clintons grew stronger the clintons benefited from the relationship lasater contributed money to the governors campaign lent roger clinton 8 000 to pay off a drug debt sponsored fundraising parties at his offices made his private plane available to the ambitious young governor for campaign jaunts and encouraged his staff to donate to the governors campaign promising higher commissions to compensate for the donations according to published reports at one point in 1985 he also made his plane available to squire celebrities to a charity function organized by hillary rodham clinton lasater benefited from the closer ties too in the summer of 1985 clinton successfully lobbied the arkansas legislature to approve a contract for lasater to sell 30 2 million in bonds for the new state police radio system the contract netted lasaters firm 750 000 according to a report in the los angeles times meanwhile lasater spread his financial wings beyond arkansas signing deals to trade treasury bond futures with several savings and loans including walkers first american the s ls were trying to compensate for their moneylosing mortgage lending operations by engaging in the highrisk deals being peddled by lasater but things began to sour in late 1985 both in illinois and in arkansas at first american walker discovered that lasaters bond firm didnt have the magic touch according to court records walkers s l lost at least 361 572 in tbond futures trades made by lasaters firm they had general authority to trade but they were supposed to call the first american operating officer each time they made a trade walker said in a telephone interview they did not do that meanwhile law enforcement officers in arkansas had started picking up reports that lasater had another problem he was distrib h9297 uting cocaine to friends and business associ ates at swank parties he threw in little rock and hot springs walker struck first filing a 1985 suit against lasaters bond firm alleging that the company committed mail wire and securities fraud by using first american funds for unauthorized tbond futures trades walker never got lasater in court first american was seized in 1986 by federal officials who later charged the former illinois governor with lending himself 1 4 million in federally insured deposits walker was eventually convicted of bank fraud and perjury federal officials also collared lasater they convicted him of cocaine possession and trafficking in 1986 meanwhile the federal regulators who seized first american decided to pursue the savings and loans 3 3 million suit against lasater to see if they could recoup some money for american taxpayers who funded the billiondollar bailout of hundreds of bankrupt savings and loans including first american the governments deposit insurance fund hired the rose law firm in little rock where hillary clinton was a powerhouse rose had successfully solicited the governments legal work on failed savings and loans in arkansas months earlier the lasater connection caused no end of problems for gov clinton during his reelection campaign in 1986 clinton came under attack from his republican opponent for steering state contracts to lasater while lasater was under investigation for drug trafficking clinton acknowledged being friends with lasater but denied knowing about lasaters drug activities clinton was reelected in 1987 lasater went off to serve his prison sentence after giving patsy thomasson another key clinton supporter and democratic party activist legal authority to manage his assets according to court records most of the rose firms s l legal work was andied by webster hubbel now the no 3 official at the unitedstates justice department but the firm assigned the governments suit against lasater to hillary clinton and vincent foster who later became deputy white house counsel for president clinton and who committed suicide last july in late 1987 court records show hillary clinton and foster negotiated a confidential settlement lasater paid the government 200 000 in return for the dismissal of its 3 3 million suit against him whether lasater got off cheaply at the expense of the american taxpayer depends upon his assets at the time and the strength of the evidence against him legal experts say nevertheless thomas scorza a former assistant unitedstates attorney who teaches legal ethics at the university of chicago law school said hillary clintons decision to represent the government in a lawsuit against lasater raises serious questions about her professional conduct a lawyer is required to represent the interest of their client zealously he said there is a substantial question about whether an attorney was representing a client zealously if the opponent of the client is someone with whom the attorney had a political financial and personal r~lationship in looking at the settlement were they the rose law firm looking after lasaters interests or the interests of the fdic scorza asked hillary clintons office declined to respond to specific questions about the case but issued a general statement defending her legal ethics our view is that hillary clinton when a lawyer at the rose law firm acted with the utmost integrity and professionallsm i have no reason to believe otherwise said her press secretary lisa caputo to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest scorza said hillary clinton should not have worked on the walker s l caseespecially because the final settlement was confidential the tribune learned of the amount of the settlement from a february 1989 letter that foster wrote to the fdic the letter was not part of the court filing theres no evidence in the court case that the rose law firm or hillary clinton ever disclosed to their client the fdic the ties between tie clintons and lasater or thomasson who was representing lasaters interests at the time of the settlement thomasson who later became executive secretary of the arkansas democratic party is now director of the white house office of administration david barr an fdic spokesman said fdic attorneys are trying to locate records on first american to see if the rose law firm notified the fdic about any potential conflict of interest a law firm can be banned from receiving further work from the fdic and the resolution trust corp which disposes the assets of failed s ls if it misleads fdic officials about a possible conflict of interest barr said the first american case isnt the only problem for the firm which hillary clinton left before her husband assumed the presidency the fdic is trying to determine whether the rose firm misled federal regulators about a potential conflict of interest when the firm represented the deposit insurance fund against the accountants who worked for madison guaranty hillary clinton had represented madison the savings and loan at the heart of whitewater in addition fdic officials are looking into the case of home federal savings and loan of centralia another failed illinois institution which is very similar to the first american case it is not known whether hillary clinton was directly involved in the home federal case the rose law firm represented home federal in a 4 6 million suit against lasaters company for unauthorized trading but what is unusual about this case is that lasater too was represented by an attorney with ties to rose king betz former president of home federal said he initially hired the rose law firm because the claims in his suit were nearly identical to those in the first american case he said that vince foster was the lead attorney in the case and that he had no contact with hillary clinton after the government took over home federal it continued the case meanwhile though thomas mars a rose attorney who had worked with foster and hillary clinton in the first american suit against lasater left the rose firm months later he started representing lasater against home federal which was still represented by rose legal experts say the rose law firm should have notified betz and the fdic ab6ut mars potential conflict of interest because mars worked on the first american suit he could have had inside information that gave him an advantage in negotiating a settlement for lasater in the home federal suit betz says foster never told him about lasaters ties to the clintons he also failed to advise betz about mars potential conflict of interest betz said foster advised him to accept a 250 000 outofcourt settlement in we were told by the attorneys that we were not going to get any more money said betz who agreed to the settlement when told that mars had previously worked with foster and hillary clinton in the first federal case betz said he cant do that he could have confidential information mars denied any

gentleman for yielding me this time let me begin this process by first congratulating the gentleman from ohio and the members of the republican budget committee in the 8 years that i have been in congress and watched this budget process this is the most professional most dedicated and most real effort that i have seen by any budgeteering group they have got the right conceptual framework that we ought to grow down the size of the government and allow more freedom to grow up the freeenterprise sector of the american economy that only by growth in the private sector can we generate the revenues to support this enormous government spending program and only then can we decrease the deficit if we combine with that growth in revenues from a growing private sector a containment of growth in the public sector it takes courage it takes commitment it takes details a few weeks ago we were challenged on our side of the aisle to put up or shut up and the fact of the matter is the republicans on the committee on the budget put up details pain sacrifice not sacrifice by those of us who senator gramm says are pulling the wagon and paying higher taxes by heaping on more taxes but sacrifice by those who are in the wagon by reductions in government largesse and containment of the size of government what do we have from the democrats the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is the massive tax increases which are immediate and certain on all of the american people and if in fact you happen to be earning 30 000 a year and suffering a tax increase by this clinton plan they will perform the magic of redefinition and give you by a redefinition of your income the status of being a wealthy american by imputing to you through the government alleged earnings of your children the rental value of your home the inside value buildup of your retirement programs the cheating on your taxes that this government under clinton is assuming that we all do by either unreported or underreported income they will make you wealthy this presidency is going to make us all wealthy by simply redefining income now in addition to that pain we have the payoff to all of the government agencies the supporters the communities in addition to all of that payoff in thisgovernment stimulate pork package we have then the promise the promise we have all heard before to the american citizens is once again the democrats have said take the pain of the higher taxes allow us to fulfill the payoff to our constituency groups allow us to provide the pork early and we promise you the cuts later ladies and gentlemen the cuts will not arrive the cuts will not get off the launching pad the cuts are the fiction of democratic budgetary policy the pain is real the suffering is optional vote for kasich vote against the democrats fiction the plan offered by president clinton and the democrat majority and the one developed by the budget committee republicans offer the american people a stark contrast in our respective parties approach to tax and budget policy the democrats want to tax the people and grow the government while republicaos want to grow the private sector and constrain the government the democrat package contains the largest tax increase in american history and tens of billions in new spending by contrast the republican alternative cuts spending and the deficit 430 billion without increasing taxes without slashing defense and without cutting social security the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is massive tax increases which are immediate and certain the payoff is the stimulate government package which even the washington post notes is an effort to reward democrat constituencies with taxpayer money and the promiseone weve heard so many times befores that a few years from now well cut government spending in reality the democrat plan will grow the government and shrink the economy it will mean fewer jobs for ordinary americans particulariy when coupled with the new wave of regulations we are certain to see on behalf of big labor and other special interests the reason job growth has been stagnant is that the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent in the last few years and i remind my democrat friends that during the reagan boomthe longest peacetime expansion of the economy in history it was small business that created 75 percent of the new jobs in america what does the republican plan do it achieves more deficit reduction than the clinton plan by reducing federal spending less than 3 percent thats right 3 percent its appalling that my friends in the democrat majority and the new democrats in the white house would stick the american taxpayer with the largest tax increase in american history while refusing to reduce government by even 3 percent in fact the democrat plan adds tens of billions in new spending while the democrat plan asks all americans to pay higher taxes for more government the republican plan asks the beneficiaries of government largesse to contribute to deficit reduction the republican plan cuts federal overhead reduces congress bloated budget asks wealthy medicare recipients to pay a larger portion of their health care costs requires federal workers to work until age 62 like everyone else instead of retiring at 55 it reforms foreign aid puts medicaid patients in a managed care program and saves taxpayer dollars by empowering lowincome americans to use housing vouchers instead of building expensive crimeridden public housing and best of all the republican plan eliminates unnecessary programs and government agencies like the interstate commerce commission which was created in 1887 to regulate the railroads i would like to compliment my colleague mr kasich and the other republicans on the budget committee for putting together an honest fair and wellbalanced plan that reduces the deficit without raising taxes this plan attacks the root of our deficit problem runaway federal spending balancing the budget and encouraging a prosperous and growing economy requires a twopoint plan we must first limit government spending as this plan daes and we must pass a progrowth package which reduces the cost of capital and labor and encourages our people to save and invest i would say in closing that the clinton taxandspend plan will fail as i told another president 3 years ago durtng the 1990 budget summit higher tas and ~her spending will stifle growth in the private eoonomy kim jobs and not reduce the deficit the cinton plan is the 1990 budget deal pan ii in super 3d with twice the tax increase i urge my coieagues to reject the big government democrat agenda and support the kasich alternative which cuts 430 biliton from the deficit and gets america back on the path to prosperity by asking govemmem to

revelations into whitewaterrelated activities as reported today in the washington times and i would like to expand a little bit on the story and i hope everybody will bear with me a little bit because it is a very convoluted involved story that leads everyone who knows something about it to believe that there needs to be a complete congressional investigation involving whitewater as well as possible drugrelated transactions a fellow named jerry seper of the washington times wrote and i am going to quote the first paragraph whitewater madison investigators are looking at a little rock investment firm owned by a convicted cocaine dealer to find out if drug profits were laundered through banks and other financial outlets and later masked as campaign contributions to arch governor bill clinton now what he is talking about here and i will jump through a lot of this is a fellow who is named dan lasater mr lasater is a businessman who is very successful he started a company called lasater co and mr lasater has been involved in business down in arkansas for a long time now mr lasater was a major contributor financial supporter of bill clinton as well as a personal friend throughout much of bill clintons political career during the time that bill clinton was governor and running for reelection as i said mr lasater gave him major contributions and major financial support mr lasater in 1986 was indicted and convicted of dealing in drugs and he received a 30month jail sentence he was believed to have been involved in not only drugs but laundering drug money at the same time bill clintons brother was involved in this alleged scheme and he was convicted as well mr lasater did not go to prison he spent 4 months in a halfway house and then i think he had 2 months under house arrest and then in 1990 bill clinton pardoned mr lasater and mr lasater after being pardoned became the chairman of the board of the phoenix mortgage co at that time a lady named patsy thomasson who had been associated with mr lasater and bill clinton she was also at that time in the late eighties and early nineties head of the democrat party in arkansas miss thomasson was the executive vice president of the lasater co and when mr lasater was indicted and convicted she took over as the chief executive officer and ran the company in his absence when mr lasater was pardoned by bill clinton miss thomasson became the president of the phoenix group so she was an associate of mr lasater before during and after his conviction for drug crimes now mr lasater while he was being investigated by the state police of arkansas for being involved in cocaine trafficking received a 664 million bond contract from the state of arkansas signed by the governor and he made 1 3 million off of this transaction this was during the time he was being investigated and later convicted for drug trafficking now a fellow named dennis patrick who was county court clerk in kentucky and this is a convoluted story so please bear with me it is hard to follow was contacted by an old schoolmate named steven love and mr love worked for mr lasaterin his brokerage house in arkansas mr love had gone to school with mr patrick and they were close friends he called ir patrick and said he wanted to take him on a fishing and hunting trip all eipenses paid on a private jet to an exotic place he was going to tell him how he could make a lot of money mr patrick went with him during the trip mr love told him that he was going to try to help him to set him up and help him make at least 20 000 a month from bond transactions mr patrick thought this was very interesting but he did not think anything would come of it a month later mr love called him and told him he had made 20 000 and he ought to come down to arkansas to visit him and the lasater firm because he had been the beneficiary of this 20 000 he had not invested anything he had not signed anything but he thought if i made 20 000 i would even get on skates and go down there he went down to arkansas mr love called over to the first american bank to somebody he knew over there and told them that he was sending mr patrick over there and they were opening up an account for 20 000 for him mr patrick went over and signed some papers opening up this account after that subsequent to that mr lasaters firm started running through patrick associates dennis patricks company bond transactions these bond transactions ultimately over the next 2 years 3 years amounted to between 60 and 107 million mr patrick did not know anything about them he did not know anything about them until later when two of the principals in the agency of the lassister co came to visit him and left him with some documents that he did not understand they were bond transactions these bonds were transferred without his approval and nobody knows where the money came from to buy the bonds and the 107 million was transferred to the security pacific bank branch in new york and first american bank inlittle rock mr patrick did not know anything about it he did not know where the money came from he did not know who bought the bonds but he did find out subsequently that these transactions had taken place and the money went into mr lasaters account i mr lasater as i said went to jail patsy thomasson was the chief financial officer for that company so that she had to know about these financial transactions patsy thomasson for those who do not know is now the director of the presidents administration at the white house she runs the white house today she is the lady that was the executive officer running this company or in large part during the time that this 197 million in bond transactions took place it is very possible very possible that this money was drug money that was being laundered through buying unitedstates treasury bonds and then sold through these two banks security pacific bank and first national first american and the money was then going into mr lassiters account we believe we think that it is real possible very possible that patsy thomasson knew about these transactions she is one of the lead principles in the white house the director of administration running the clinton white house we think that this alone is reason enough to have a congressional investigation there is so much involved in this that it almost becomes hard to follow my colleagues and i have been working on this all day long but i would like to show to my colleagues copies of the transactions that took place these bond transactions that took place in 1985 and 1986 they just came to the attention of the media and the congress today they are related to the entire whitewater scandal this congress needs to have hearings on this we know there is an investigation going on with the special counsel many are concerned that this is not going to get the complete hearing that it should with the special counsels investigation we are not trying to impugn the integrity of the special counsel we do believe he had close ties mr fiske had close ties and has had close ties with mr nussbaum who used to be at the white house we know that for a fact because they had legal dealings together on a number of cases we know mr fiske represented the international paper co and international paper sold several hundred acres to the whitewater development corp mr fiske is investigating all of this in order to make sure that mr fiske does his job properly as well as the congress does its job in conducting its oversight requirement under the constitution we believe that congressional investigations are absolutely necessary here is a man who was convicted of dealing in drugs here is a man who was pardoned by the nowpresident of the united states here is a man who during the time he was under investigation by the arkansas state police got 664 million in state bond contracts from which he made 1 3 million here is a man who was very close to the president of the united states was a major major contributor and went everyplace with the president as i said before he was pardoned patsy thomasson who is one of president clintons righthand persons at the white house and has been for a long long time the head of the demo crat party in arkansas during his administration she was tied to lassiter before during and after the tinie he was convicted of drug dealing she was running his company when all of these bond transactions 107 million took place and nobody knows from when the money came but they know the money was transferred through dennis patricks account he did not know anything about it so it must have been an illegal transaction that should be investigated by the irs and the fbi the money went to mr lassiter and his account in these two banks i alluded to earlier in order for us to vindicate the president get all of this cleared up in order for us to vindicate and clear up patsy thomassons relations with mr lasater in order for us to protect dennis patrick and i might add that dennis patricks life has been not only threatened they tried to kill him three times since all of this took place the man has been in hiding with his family because he is afraid he is going to be killed he was in to see us today in order to protect him we need to have congressional hearings it is absolutely imperative this goes beyond whitewater it goes into drug trafficking it goes into money laundering it goes into all kinds of things in order for this president to be able to do his job effectively we think this all needs to be cleared up the only way it is going to be cleared up is through a dongressional investigation let m say one more thing and then i will yield to my colleague the gentleman from california that is this some people will say this is political i think it goes way beyond politics but we must look back to the reagan and bush administration when things that were of much less consequence than this much less consequence than this to the american people were investigated by congressional hearings there were 23 congressional hearings during the bush and reagan administrations and every time we asked for anything any information relating to whitewater or anything else we were stonewalled by the administration and the entire executive branch it was that way in the ron brown affair and it is that way in whitewater and we believe it is going to be that way in this drug investigation we are talking about right now and the possible money laundering i say to my colleagues and to anybody else who is paying attention this is a very serious matter it deserves congressional oversight it deserves congressional investigation it is our responsibility as a congress to look into this i would say to my colleagues let u get on with it if it was a republica administration we would have don this months ago it is a democrat ad ministration and let us do the righ thing and clear this thing up

to say americans of middleincome for the clinton health care bill and for the clinton health care bill in its legislative form in the other body where it is the clintonmitchell bill and in the house where it is the clintongephardt bill the same phenomenon occurred last year during consideration of the clinton tax bill during the 1992 campaign as a candidate he talked about middleclass tax cut but in fact we know how quickly that evaporated once we got down to brass tacks instead this congress pushed through the biggest tax increase in american history one that directly impacted the middle class for example seniors receiving social security making 14 000 got a 70percent effective rate increase on their social security benefits that is how much their income taxes went up on social security benefits that recordbreaking tax increase passed by the congress will pale in comparison to the clintongephardt bill that we are likely to take on here in the house although it is difficult for us to talk about it as members of congress because while we have looked at the press releases and press statements about the bill we are still waiting we are still waiting for a bill even though we are just days away from adjournment and the congress hopes to act on health care before we adjourn but we do not have a bill the congressional budget office has not been able to give us an estimate of how much precisely in the way of new taxes the bill contains and precisely how much in the way of new spending the bill contains we simply have not read it this is more than a trivial point health care comprises oneseventh of our nations economy it is also on a more personal level a matter of life and death for every american one would think that a new health care plan prescribed by the federal government for the whole country would therefore be the most carefully studied document since the constitution but instead when as and if this congress and house get around to seeing and voting on a bill we are going to find that members have not had a chance to read it that in fact when we vote members will know more about o j simpsons blood type than they will about the content of our own health care legislation but we operate necessarily in an environment of uncertainty we do not have a bill but we must debate what it is we anticipate because after all the vote will be upon us and that will be it and we will have an election we must adjourn at some point and that point is arriving rather quickly why are people skeptical of what they have been seeing the heritage foundation did an analysis of the clintongephardt bill as it was released what they found is that the ew taxes and there are many of them in the clintongephardt bill would amount to 42 6 billion in the first full effective year of the plan in 1999 on top of the current costs on the system people who are saying these new taxes are only going to displace existing health care costs or somehow limit the growth of health care costs must face this fact 42 6 billion in new taxes will be imposed by the clintongephardt health care bill on top of our current estimates for how much the existing system is going to cost now the average additional tax burden per individual as a result of the clintongephardt bill according to the heritage foundation is 430 per individual on average the clintongephardt bill unquestionably is going to offer americans less choice it does not quite do justice to the fact to say less almost none compared to what presently an insured american has available congress and the federal government are going to prescribe a standard health care plan and that is going to be the norm for the country like it or not if your existing plan is different than the standard plan if you continue to get those benefits you will pay a tax not only will you pay a tax but your employer will pay a tax the new taxes imposed by the clintongephardt bill are going to be split 80 percent by the employer and 20 percent by the individual so 20 percent of these new taxes will come directly out of the paycheck of the american worker there will be far more bureaucracy in this plan because for a substantial part it is going to rely upon something called medicare part c medicare part c is in effect a governmentrun insurance plan that will extend together with the existing medicare program to over half the entire population or to about half the entire population according to our best estimates half of the american people at that point will be getting their health care from a government plan as compared to the current system the more americans learn it seems the more likely they are to realize that instead of providing americans with greater health security the clinton gephardt plan clinton mitchell plan over in the other body and whatever congressional cousins are aboard or are just now being written in so many different staff offices will create greater uncertainty especially for middleincome americans middleincome americans will pay more in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both quantity availability of health care and the quality of that care why will they be paying more in premiums we discussed why they pay more in taxes under the clinton gephardt bill why pay more in premiums because of the community rating system that is where factors like age cannot be taken into account senior citizens incur about 4 timeson average in the way of health care costs as younger working americans if you are under 45 years old you will have a steep increase in your health care premiums under a community rating system so for all americans under 45 years old the clinton gephardt plan the clinton gephardt health care plan is going to represent a big increase in premiums on top of the payroll tax increase it is not surprising then that the strategy of the democrat leadership is to in the words of senator rockfeller

budget plans which have been introduced as viable and specific alternatives to president clintons budget during last years presidential campaign governor clinton went out of his way to promise the american middle class that he would relieve their tax burdens and reduce the deficit since moving into the white house almost 2 months ago president clinton proposed a budget plan which will not relieve the tax burdens of the middle class however the clinton plan will hit the middle class hard not once but twice and possibly more times first the clinton plan will hit the middle class through new taxes namely the new btu tax increased social security taxes and increased estate taxes and second the clinton plan will hit the middle class again through spending cute president clintonin a now famous offertold us republicans that if we were not satisfied we should come up with an alternative plan but to be specific and to subject the plan to intense scrutiny and scoring by the congressional budget office well as you have already heard the house republicahs on the budget committee under the brilliant stewardship of john kasich released an alternative which practically matches the presidents level of deficit reduction over 5 years the kasich plan eliminates all of the clinton tax increases and offsets the lost revenue with additional spending cutswhich are specific and have been verified by the congressional 3budget office let me say that i praise john kasich and his republican colleagues on the budget committee for their tremendous efforts i fully intend to vote for the kasich plan because i believe that we do not need new taxes we need more spending cuts john kasich acconplishes this objective however as the next best proposal i have worked with several of my colleagues from throughout the nation and coming from various points on the political spectrum together we are offering what i would call a consensus budget which takes the cuts in the clinton plan the cute in the republican plan and adds more spending cut proposals which cut deeper into the federal budget deficit beyond that it cuts the clinton tax increases by more than half it accomplishes this by eliminating the btu energy tax the social security tax and the tax increase on corporations which reduces the dividends paid to middleclass stockholders and seriously impedes economic growth in this country yes the solomon plan removes all the onerous clinton taxes on the middle class let me repeat that this solomon consensus plan achieves greater deficit reduction than clinton with no onerous taxes on the middle class this way the middle class is not forced to pay more than its fair share in reducing the deficit our primary objective is to reduce the federal budget deficit so that the american government does not mortgage the future of our children and grandchildren in compiling our plan our two guiding principles remain the achievement of fairness in the tax code and the accomplishment of real meaningful deficit reduction we believe that the clinton plan imposes unfair and disproportionate burdens on the middle class while our plan asks sacrifices of most everyone through deeper spending cuts it refrains from imposing any of the heavy tax burdens which the clinton plan requires let me just look at this chart with my good friend the gentleman from wisconsin what this plan does is combine the clinton budget with the kasich budget it then cuts clintons tax increases by more than half again by eliminating the btu energy tax the elimination of the social security tax and removing the tax increase on corporations thereby removing those taxes which erode the buying power of middleclass america it activates a new tax bracket of 200 000 instead of the 140 000 that is tax relief for those people but it also adds a stimulant to the economy by providing vital tax incentives as we see down here by the four bullets by extending the expiring business tax incentives restoring real estate passive loss providing capital gains tax deductions for startup companies and repealing the luxury tax on boats let me just sum up fast because we have two other speakers here first of all for every dollar of new taxes our plan cuts 4 in spending ross perot told me this afternoon he was satisfied if we would cut 2 in spending for 1 in taxes we cut 4 in spending for every 1 in taxes and we dedicate all of the tax increases to deficit reduction it contains no new spending that is what the american people want it cuts clintons tax increases by more than half with no taxes on the middle class our plan contains some of the clinton cuts it contains all of the republican cuts and it includes much deeper cuts including the super collider and a number of others which many of you have been talking about doing the spending cuts and this is terribly important occur before tax increases 41 billion in spending cuts this year alone under this plan it cuts spending listen to this by over 485 billion and that is more than double than what clinton does it reduces the deficit and listen to this and mr perot was shocked when he heard how much this cuts off the deficit reduction 637 billion and that is 171 billion more than clinton and it leaves a 1998 deficit level of 18 billion lower than president clinton with less than half the tax increases finally it is the only plan with mandatory sequestration that is built in if the actions by this congress exceed this budget limit you are going to have acrosstheboard cuts that guarantees that these funds are going for tax reductions i am just going to point out one thing which is terribly important and it is terribly important to you democrats the spending cuts that the president is asking for in 1994 are just 6 billion 6 billion and in 1995 he is asking to cut spending by just 10 billion and then he loads out in the last 3 years with heavy spending cuts why do you think it is done that way i can tell you because we still have sequestration in the law for the next 2 years 1994 and 1995 if congress does not meet the spending caps it does not mean anything because there is no spending cut anyway our bill carries those spending cuts with sequestration through the whole 5 years that is what is so terribly important about this bill and why every member of this body ought to be supporting him i yield 5

lifted them from the degradations of poverty in their senior years my mother receives social security my grandmother receives social security they both need and depend on their social security checks

security benefits i do my very best every day to help each and every one of my constituents who has any difficulty in obtaining the social security benefits to which they are entitled by law i am and i will always remain an ardent advocate for social security it is for this reason that i am outraged by the distortions and the outright lies of many of those who oppose the social security provisions in president clintons economic plan in a partisan effort to oppose the president many who know better are causing fear among many senior citizens who have nothing at all to fear and much to gain from the presidents plan it is long past time to look beyond the rhetoric of the fearmongers and examine the facts the fact is if you dont pay taxes on your social security benefits now you will not pay taxes on your benefits once the presidents plan is enacted at present 80 percent of social security beneficiaries do not pay income taxes on their benefits they wont under the presidents plan for example seniors earning less than 25 000 currently pay no taxes on their social security benefits under the presidents proposal they still will not pay taxes on those benefits the fact is the additional tax on social security benefits proposed by the senateand since endorsed by me with my vote and by the overwhelming majority of the houseapplies to only 13 percent of social security recipients these 13 percent are the most affluent by far with an average net worth of at least 1 million taxing them is fair clearly these are not impoverished seniors surviving on meager fixed incomes the fact is the presidents plan would not hurt the needy it would not touch colas on social security on which needy seniors depend i would oppose any plan that would cut colas for needy seniors because that would plunge half a million americans into poverty overnight i would oppose any effort to try to balance the budget on the b cks of needy seniors the presidents plan would not do that the factis this is not a confiscation of social security benefits but merely an inclusion of more of the benefits of the most affluent recipients for purposes of calculating their taxes at the customary rates if you are paying taxes on your benefits now then under the presidents proposal 85 percent of your social security benefits will be included in calculating your taxes at the appropriate rate instead of the current 50 percent if you are not paying taxes on your social security benefits now you will be completely unaffected by the presidents proposal the fact is this is not double taxation the average wage earner gets back in social security benefits every penny he puts in social security payroll taxes during this entire working life plus interest in less than 5 years everything received beyond that is simply a transfer payment from current workers to retireesover and above what the retirees paid in and would have otherwise accrued in interest eightyfive percent of the benefits that the average recipient receives over his lifetime are over and above what that recipient paid into the system while working plus interestwhich is precisely why that specific percentage of benefits was chosen for inclusion in taxation the fact is the presidents proposal may actually provide tax relief for some seniors on social security the senate proposal to which the house of representatives recently agreedand which i favorcreates new and higher income thresholds of 32 000 for single taxpayers and s40 000 for married couples before any social security benefits are taxed an increase to 85 percent of the amount of social security benefits subject to tax would apply only to income above these new and higher thresholds this means that fewer people will be paying taxes on their social security under the presidents proposal than are paying taxes on such benefits now these are the facts and i am confident that the vast majority of my constituents and the vast majority of the american people are smart enough to respond to the facts and not to the fears inspired by those with purely partisan motives once this plan is enacted come next april when they pay their taxes seniors will know they have been misleadbut not by me and not by the president the fact is most federal spending is for social security and other mandatory and entitlement programs many of
