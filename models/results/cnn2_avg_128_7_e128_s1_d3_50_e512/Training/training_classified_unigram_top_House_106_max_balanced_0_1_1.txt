{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "i originally voted for this bill but only very reluctantly i will not vote to override the presidents veto i am not voting to sustain the veto because i oppose estatetax relief for familyowned ranches and farms or other small businesses in fact i definitely think we should act to make it easier for their owners to pass them on to future generations this is important for the whole country or course but it is particularly important for coloradans who want to help keep ranch lands in open undeveloped condition by reducing the pressure to sell them to pay estate taxes but there is a better way to do it than by enacting this republican bill that is why i voted for the democratic alternative when the house originally considered this bill that democratic alternative bill would have provided real effective relief without the excesses of the republican bill it would have raised the estate taxs special exclusion to 4 million for a couple owning a farm or small business so under that alternative a married couple owning a family farm or ranch or a small business worth up to 4 million could pass it on intact with no estate tax whatsoever also the democratic alternative actually would have provided more immediate relief to small business and farm owners unlike the republican billwhich is phased in over 10 yearsthe democratic alternative would have taken effect immediately that means a couple passing on their farm or small business in the near future would avoid more tax under the democratic plan than under the republican bill they would not have to hope to live long enough to see the benefits in addition by increasing the general exclusion from 675 000 to 1 1 million next year the democratic alternative would have allowed parents to pass on millionaire status to their children without a penny of estate tax burden and the democratic alternative also would have lowered estate tax rates by 20 across the board so the democratic alternativewhich i voted for which deserved adoption and which would not have been vetoedwould have provided important relief from the estate tax and would have done so in a real effective and prompt way furthermore the democratic alternative would have provided this relief in a fiscally responsible way that would not jeopardize our ability to do what is needed to maintain and strengthen social security and medicare provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and pay down the public debt by contrast it is precisely the fiscal overkill of the republican bill that made me most reluctant to vote for it and that leads me to vote to sustain the presidents veto as the rocky mountain news put it in a september 3rd editorial the republican tax cut is a gamble that the present economic boom isnt going to slow and is fiscally irre mr lantos i will vote today sponsible to uphold the presidents veto of the estate once fully phased in the republican bill tax elimination act would forgo nearly 50 billion a year in rev when this legislation was first considered in enue with no guarantee that this revenue loss the house in june i strongly supported and will not harm social security and medicare in voted for the democratic alternative which was future years presented by congressman rangel of new the bills sponsors say it will cost 28 2 bil york that proposal called for a significant relion over 5 years and 104 5 billion over 10 duction in the rate of taxation of estates and years but that is far from the whole story be a 50 percent increase in the small business cause of the way the bill is phased in its true exclusion the rangel proposal was a cost is cleverly hidden and does not show up thoughtful and reasonable effort to deal with until after the 10year budget window the legitimate concerns of small businesses that means the full effects of the repub and family farms but it did not have the problican bill will come just at the time when we lems of the legislation which was being urged will have to face budget pressures because by the republican majority my own baby boom generation is starting to when the rangel substitute was defeated retire and if we feel we need to phase in by the house i nevertheless voted for the h r 8 because we cannot afford the full re adoption of h r 8 in order to continue the legpeal now how are we ever going to afford it islative process initial senate action was 10 years from now much closer to the rangel substitute and i we do not need to engage in this fiscal expected a housesenate conference comoverkill mittee to produce a bill that i could support according to the treasury department unfortunately the senate simunder current law only 2 of all decedents ply accepted the flawed version of the bill as have enough wealth to be subject to the es adopted by the house and did not make those tate tax at all changes that would improve the legislation to be more specific the treasury depart president clinton was right to veto this bill ment tells me that in 1997 estatetax returns and i will vote to sustain that veto were filed for only 297 coloradans i urge my colleagues in the furthermore according to the treasury de republican leadership of this house to work partment of those estates that are affected by with the democratic leadership and with the the estate tax only 30 that is only 6 in president to craft legislation that deals with the 10 000 american estateswere comprised legitimate problems of estate taxation and that primarily of familyowned small businesses provides the relief small businesses need we ranches or farms need to deal with legitimate problems with the looking just at our state that means that in federal estate tax but this bill is clearly the 1997 fewer than a dozen estatetax returns wrong way to do that"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i support passage of bankruptcy reform and so in order for it to pass before the adjournment of the 106th congress i will vote for this rule and for the conference report but the reason the republican leadership has been forced to resort to this kind of parliamentary game is because the republican majority in this congress has left unfinished the agenda that matters most to the people of this country it is october 12 and there is not an end in sight to this congress and there is little hope left that the real american agenda will be finished thus in order to pass legislation which has overwhelming bipartisan support the republican leadership has resorted to using tricks and games rather than regular order were thij situation not so sad it would be laughable for 2 years democrats in this body have asked the republican leadership for the opportunity to address the issues that matter most to americans real medicare prescription drug coverage real help for americas schools a real and meaningful patients bill of rights an increase in the minimum wage campaign finance reform saving social security and medicare paying down the national debt these are real issues that matter to real people but in those 2 years what have my republican colleagues done they have brought forward legislation that does everything but what the american people want when the republican leaderships position has been soundly defeated on a bipartisan basis they have simply shelved the wishes of the bipartisan majority in this house for example in august of 1999 the house passed a real patients bill of rights a bipartisan patients bill of rights passed it by a vote of 275 to 151 it took the speaker until november 3 of 1999 to appoint conferees when he did he failed to appoint a single republican conferee who supported the bill that passed the house not a single one today that conference has still not reported back to either the house or senate the patients bill of rights sits on a shelf in september of last year the house passed a bipartisan campaign finance reform bill by a bipartisan vote of 252 to 177 that bill has also disappeared into the legislative dustbin of the 106th congress the democrats in this body as well as in the senate have repeatedly asked for further consideration of that legislation but our requests have gone unanswered yet another meaningful bill sits on the shelf in the republican leaderships closet we asked that the house consider legislation that would give seniors a real medicare prescription drug benefit but we were prevented from getting a vote on the democratic version of the bill we have asked that the congress consider legislation which would provide more welltrained teachers for schools across the country in order to reduce class size we have been ignored we have asked for a clean vote on increasing the minimum wage and our republican colleagues loaded up the bill with tax cuts that would benefit the wealthiest while begrudgingly offering a 1 an hour over 2 years wage increase for americans who are at the very low end of the income scale we have asked repeatedly for this congress to consider issues that really matter to real americans the people who pay mortgages who pay rent who make car payments who send their children to school that they want to be safe but we have been ignored so we find ourselves in this situation today while the house has rules which regulate how and when legislation and amendments can come to the floor the other body does not as a consequence the refusal of the congressional republican leadership to consider real legislation that would mean something to real americans the refusal of the congressional republican leadership to sit down and work on a bipartisan basis with the democrats in the house and senate and with the president of the united states has resulted in the need to play these kinds of legislative games we are engaged in today i have long supported reform of our bankruptcy laws i support this conference report it will allow americans who need a fresh financial start to get one but it will also prevent those who have indebted themselves and who are able to pay those debts from just walking away from their obligations this bill affords new protections for consumers by requiring that credit statements include more detailed disclosures it protects the homes of individuals who live in states with homestead exemptions but not those who move there simply to claim the exemption in a bankruptcy it gives permanent chapter 12 relief to farmers many members are concerned about the process quite frankly i share their views it is not proper that the house should be considering this important legislative reform within a shell of a bill that has already been passed and signed into law but given the hour given the inability of therepublican leadership to manage the business of this house and the congress any better than it has in the past 6 years i will reluctantly vote for this rule so we may at least pass some meaningful legislation before the end

marriage tax penalty many of us over the last several years have asked a very basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code a married working couple where both a husband and wife are in the workforce that they pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right that 25 million married working couples 50 million taxpayers pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married we call that 1 400 the marriage tax penalty it affects married couples who because they have two incomes they are forced to file jointly they are pushed into a higher tax bracket and they pay higher taxes it is a marriage tax penalty and it is wrong let me introduce to the house some constituents of mine michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers from a community of manhattan just south of joliet illinois shad is a teacher at joliet high school michelle at manhattan junior high their combined income is about 62 000 they are middleclass teachers they are homeowners of course since they were married they have since had a child little ben remember their family someone new in their lives and they are so proud of little ben here who is growing very quickly their marriage tax penalty is about 1 000 a year that they pay just because they are married i think it is a fair question is it right is it fair that shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers who work very hard every day have a new little boy in their lives have to pay higher taxes send money to washington just because they are married i am proud to say this conference report before it eliminates the marriage tax penalty that good people hardworking middleclass people like shad and michelle hallihan pay every year because they are married under our conference report we help those who itemize their taxes as well as those who do not now my friends on the other side of the aisle say that if one is middle class and one itemizes ones taxes usually because one is a homeowner or one gives money to ones institutions of faith or church or synagogue or charity one is rich and one does not deserve marriage tax relief well republicans and fortunately 48 democrats believe we should help the middleclass homeowners who give money to charity they are not rich they work hard shad and michelle hallihan make 62 000 a year they itemize their taxes now we help those who do not itemize their taxes in this conference by doubling the standard deduction that is used by those who do not itemize their taxes we double that for joint filers to twice that as singles for those who are itemizers like michelle and shad hallihan and little ben who are homeowners so they are forced to itemize we widen the 15 percent bracket that is the basic tax bracket that affects everybody we widen that so joint filers married couples like shad and michelle with two incomes can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in the same tax bracket the same 15 percent tax bracket what i think is most exciting about this bill not only do we help middleclass families who are homeowners and give money to church and charity who itemize those taxes as well as those who do not is that it is effective this year when we pass this legislation and put it on the presidents desk today the president will have an opportunity if he signs it into law to help married couples 25 million married working couples this year because i would point out that doubling the standard deduction which helps those who do not itemize and widening the 15 percent tax bracket which helps those who do itemize such as homeowners and those that give money to church and charity that they will receive marriage tax relief this year because this legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 think about that when my friends on the other side of the aisle and bill clinton and al gore raised taxes in 1993 they made their tax increase retroactive which meant they went back in the tax year and took ones money well this year we have an opportunity to give marriage tax relief this year which means we go back to january 1 of this year if one is married one of 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty one is going to see marriage tax relief this year in tax year 2000 that is a great opportunity if one believes in fairness in the tax code as we do it is time to make the tax code more fair and more simple we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty now my friends on the other side of the aisle have been making lots of excuses they really do not want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty because they would much rather spend shad and michelles money they believe it is better spent here in washington than shad and michelle hallihan can spend it back in joliet illinois think about it the average marriage tax penalty for good hardworking middleclass married couples like shad and michelle hallihan 1 400 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet community college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home it is 3 000 diapers for little ben the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 is really money for real people let us do the right thing let us pass this rule let us pass this legislation let us wipe out the marriage

and the south suburbs cook and will counties industrial communities like joliet and a lot of suburban towns as well as cornfields and grain elevators the folks back home have a pretty clear message even in such a diverse district they want us to meet our challenges and work together and come up with solutions that is why they are so proud of what this congress has accomplished in the last 4 years with balancing the budget for the first time in 28 years cutting taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years reforming welfare for the first time in a generation and taming the tax collector by reforming the irs for the first time ever those are real accomplishments and folks say well thats pretty good but thats history what are we going to do next well this congress and this republican house have several very very important goals we want to strengthen and make our schools not only better but safer we want to strengthen social security by locking away 100 percent social security revenues for social security we want to pay down the national debt and of course we want to continue working to lower taxes for the middle class and for working families this year as we work to lower taxes and to lower the tax burden for middleclass families i believe that the approach we should take is to adclress the unfairness in the tax code because when i listen to the folks back home whether in the union hall or the vfw a local chamber of commerce or at a coffee shop in my hometown down on liberty street people say that not only are their taxes too high they complain about the complexity and the unfairness of the tax code i believe this series of questions really illustrates a key area of unfairness that we should make a priority in this congress this year in getting the job done on eliminating this most unfair area of our tax code that is why i want to explain why enactment of the marriage tax elimination act is so important with the question of fairness do americans really feel that it is fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes just because they are married do americans feel that it is right that 21 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more under our tax code just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple with identical incomes who live together outside of marriage clearly i think the american people agree that the marriage tax penalty is wrong and we need to set it right the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong it is wrong that under our tax code you are punished for getting married as i noted earlier it affects 21 million married working couples on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married let me give an example here of a couple in the south suburbs of chicago you have a case where a machinist and of course this particular machinist works at caterpillar in joliet he makes the heavy machinery that we use to mine and dig things and build things he makes 30 500 if he is single after the standard deductions and exemptions he is in the 15 percent tax bracket but under our tax code because two working people who choose to get married their incomes are combined and in fact you file your taxes jointly you are pushed into a higher tax bracket this example of this south suburban couple this machinist who meets and marries a schoolteacher in the joliet public schools with an identical income of 30 500 because under our tax code they combine their incomes and their combined income is 61 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and because this machinist and this schoolteacher in joliet illinois in the south suburbs of chicago chose to get married they pay more in taxes that is just wrong of course i would like to point out that for this schoolteacher and this machinist in joliet 1 400 is real money 1 400 is one years tuition at joliet junior college our local community college and it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center we need to eliminate that marriage tax penalty it is wrong that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher end up paying higher taxes when they get married had they chose not to get married and just lived together their taxes would have been 1 400 less that is just wrong under the marriage tax elimination act we eliminate this marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacher in fact we do it by doubling the standard deduction we also double the brackets so that joint filers can earn twice as much as a single filer and remain in each bracket had the marriage tax elimination act been law today this machinist and schoolteacher would have seen the marriage tax penalty eliminated what is the bottom line in just a couple of weeks this house of representatives will be working to pass the tax provisions for this years balanced budget the 3rd balanced budget in 30 years thanks to a republican congress i believe as we work to provide tax relief as part of this balanced budget our first priority should be making the tax code fairer for this schoolteacher and this machinist by working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i am

here in washington than bring about tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty well i am proud to say this house is doing something about the marriage tax penalty last year we passed and sent legislation to the president which would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for over 25 million couples and unfortunately president clinton and vice president gore vetoed that bill they had

from their two teaching salaries and shad and michelle suffer almost the average marriage tax penalty well under the legislation that the house is going to be considering this week shad and michelle will benefit because two public school teachers who chose to get married who now suffer the marriage tax penalty will essentially have their marriage tax penalty wiped out michelle told me the other day she says congressman tell your friends in the congress particularly those who believe it is not a good idea to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what wiping out the marriage tax penalty would mean for them they say 1 000 which is essentially the marriage tax penalty would buy 3 000 diapers for their newborn baby that is money that is currently going to washington that they could use to take care of their child frankly if we want to be fair it is their money we should eliminate the marriage tax penalty this thursday h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act will help couples like shad and michele hallihan we do it in several ways we double the standard deduction onehalf of married couples do not itemize their taxes they use the standard deduction so we double it for joint filers the marriage penalty is created when a married couple of course get married they file their taxes jointly their combined income usually pushes them into a higher tax bracket that is what pushes shad and michelle into the 28 percent bracket what we want to do of course is for the nonitemizers which is about half of the married couples who suffer the marriage penalty to double the standard deduction for joint filers to make it twice that of singles for those who itemize who are the other half of married couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty those who itemize are homeowners the average middleclass family itemizes their taxes because they own a home we want to help them and provide marriage tax relief as well so we widen the 15 percent bracket the basic tax bracket that every one of us pays we are all in the 15 percent bracket regardless of our income for the lowest bottom bracket of our income by widening the bracket so that joint filers married couples can earn twice as

provided prescription drugs for our seniors we are paying off the national debt with a plan we have adopted by the year 2013 already paying down the debt by 350 billion and we are also working to make our tax code more fair particularly more fair for working and middle class families we have often asked in this house many of us a pretty basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that

hallihan that is a years tuition at our local community college joliet junior college which is our nations oldest it is also 3 months of day care for a child that is why i think it is important to introduce a new photo of shad and miohelle hallihan since they were married at the time that we introduced the legislation they have since had a baby and if al gore and my friends on the other side of the aisle had their way the child will probably be grown and out of college by the time we eliminate the marriage tax penalty shad and michelle have a little boy by the name of ben little ben has brought a lot of joy to their life but because of the marriage tax penalty there is 1 400 that goes out of the pocketbooks of shad and michelle and comes to washington money that they can use to take care of little ben and 1 400 that is about 3 000 diapers that is a lot of diapers for little ben over 18 years that 1 400 a year if they just set that full amount in a college fund that is over 25 000 that shad and michelle can invest in little ben and little bens future for college so the marriage tax penalty is real money for real people shad and michelle the way they suffer the marriage tax penalty is the marriage tax penalty occurs when you have a husband and wife who are both in the workforce they combine their income when they are married file jointly and when they combine their income that means they are pushed into a higher tax bracket if shad and michelle had chosen to stay single and just live together they each because of their income would file in the 15 percent tax bracket but they chose to participate in the most basic institution in our society which is marriage and shad and michelle because they are married now pay in the 28 percent tax bracket they suffer the marriage tax penalty we believe it is wrong we want to help michelle and shad hallihan as well as little ben to make sure he has a future and they have the resources for this under our bipartisan proposal we do several things we help those who do not itemize their taxes by doubling the standard deduction for joint filers at twice that of singles and that helps about 9 million couples of those who suffer the marriage tax penalty those are the nonitemizers well the rest subtracting 9 from 25 that leaves 18 million couples who itemize their taxes who suffer the marriage tax penalty and they are people who are average folks middle class but they probably own a house so if you own a home you probably itemize your taxes and the only way you can receive marriage tax relief is if we provide marriage tax relief as part of our proposal we do that by widening the most basic bracket the 15 percent bracket so you can earn twice as much in the 15 percent bracket if you are a joint filer as a single person and that is how we help michelle and shad hallihan as well as little ben prepare for his future by widening the 15 percent bracket i would also point out in our legislation that we provide marriage tax relief for those who participate in the earned income tax credit ensuring that they also participate and receive marriage tax relief we also protect those who use the child tax credit for the alternative minimum tax so we help both itemizers as well as nonitemizers poor working families and protect those from the amt i believe we need to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i want to thank my friends on the other side of the aisle particularly the 48 who joined with us and i invite more democrats to join with us in our effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i would

homeowner and middle class and itemize your taxes you receive no marriage tax relief under the democratic proposal democrats say they do not want to help special interests so i guess they say if you are middle class and you own a home and you itemize your taxes you are stuck and you are still going to suffer the marriage tax penalty we have a bipartisan proposal that helps those who itemize

i come from people tell me their tax burden is too high our tax burden today is 21 percent of our economy which is consumed by the federal government since 1993 the tax burden has continued to go up in fact in 1993 the tax burden was less than 18 percent today it is 21 percent of our gross domestic product going to the federal government that tax burden is too high when it comes to medicare and social security thanks to this republican congress we have a balanced budget the first balanced budget in 28 years it is now projected to provide a 3 trillion surplus over the next 10 years under our budget of course we do something that congresses of the past and presidents of the past for the last 30 years have refused to do and that is we set aside 100 percent of social security for retirement security to save medicare and social security now these 3 dollar bills i have each dollar bill represents 1 trillion under our budget we set aside 1 trillion 2 trillion in fact we set aside twothirds of the socalled surplus over the next 10 years for retirement security leaving onethird for other purposes we believe the vast majority of that extra surplus the nonsocial security surplus should go to help working families helping working families by lowering their taxes now folks complain their taxes are too high that is a common copcern but folks also tell me back home that the tax code is too complicated they are frustrated that they will have to hire someone else to do their taxes they are frustrated about the unfairness of the tax code frankly a lot of them are just plain angry that under our tax code a married working couple on average pays 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married under this packaged tax relief to help working families we eliminate the marriage tax penalty for a majority of those who suffer it i have an example here of a couple back in joliet illinois michelle and shad callahan they are schoolteachers in the joliet public school district in fact michelle here is due any day to have a baby their first child they discovered when they got married that they now pay higher taxes just because they are married in fact they pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 their combined income is about 60 000 under our legislation we passed out of the house 70 percent of taxpayers receive direct marriage tax relief i believe by the time the house and senate work out their differences more families like michelle and shad will receive marriage tax relief we work to address the marriage tax penalty addressing the unfairness in the tax code and also simplify the tax code because in the housepassed tax relief 6 million couples will no longer need to itemize i would also point out that under our legislation since michelle is due to have a baby like many moms like to do she is a working mom she may take some time off from being in the work force to be home with her baby under the legislation we passed out of the house we are going to let michelle make up missed contributions to her retirement accounts with catchup provisions that will help michelle and shad and working families just like michelle and shad callahan this legislation is good legislation we simplify the code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty for millions of working couples by eliminating the death tax which is suffered by family farmers and family businesses by

this week and that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay on average 1400 more in higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that two people who joined together in holy matrimony who both happen to work are forced to pay higher taxes if they choose to get married today the only way to avoid the marriage tax penalty if both the husband and wife work in the workforce is either choose not to get married or to get divorced that is just wrong that 25 million married working couples 50 million americans pay higher taxes just because they are married it is wrong i believe and i know many in this house do believe that it is wrong that we punish societys most basic institution marriage with higher taxes that is just unfair let me introduce to my colleagues shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers from joliet illinois shad and michelle chose to get married a couple of years ago they are both in the workforce they just had a child this past year a new baby they pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1400 they knew that going into getting married that they were going to pay more in taxes but they chose to still get married i believe it is wrong they pay 1400 more in higher taxes in joliet illinois which is a south suburban community southwest of chicago 1400 for shad and michelle hallihan the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at joliet junior college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for their child it is just wrong they have to pay more in taxes just because they are married now the marriage tax penalty comes into play when two people marry and they are both in the workforce and have two incomes because under our tax code they file jointly which means they combine their incomes so in the case of shad and michelle had they chose to stay single and just live together they would each file as singles and they would each pay in the 15 percent tax bracket but because they chose to get married their combined income pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket so they get stuck with a higher tax bill just because they chose to get married now we believe in this house and it is clearly one of the top agenda items for house republicans that we should bring about some tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty i am proud that earlier this year every house republican and 48 democrats who broke with their leadership voted to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples unfortunately senator daschle and the senate democrats used parliamentary procedures to block action on that legislation and we have now had to go through the budget process or socalled reconciliation which is a word few people know the meaning of but it allows us to bring up a bill with a simple majority vote with that ability this week both the house and senate are going to be voting on legislation which will wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples now some on the other side and al gore and a few others say well lets give just a little bit of marriage tax relief so we can say we are for it al gore says we should only give marriage tax relief to those who do not itemize their taxes those who use the standard deduction well we want to help those who do itemize as well as those who do not itemize if you think about it most middleclass families most middleclass couples itemize their taxes because they are homeowners think about that if you are a homeowner those who oppose the bill we are going to be passing this week because they do not want to help homeowners and they do not want to help those who itemize taxes because they say they are rich only rich people own homes today according to al gore and other people well the bottom line is the only way we can help shad and michelle hallihan is if we pass the legislation we are going to pass this week legislation that doubles the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that of singles so we wipe out the marriage tax penalty for those who do not itemize and then for those who do itemize such as homeowners or those who take the charitable deduction because they give to their institutions of faith or charity we also widen the 15 percent bracket to twice that for joint filers to twice that of singles that will eliminate essentially the marriage tax penalty for shad and michelle hallihan think about it if we eliminate the marriage tax penalty which we are going to vote this week to do for 25 million married working couples 50 million americans people like shad and michelle will have that extra 1 400 to take care of their child that is 3 months of daycare it is a years tuition at joliet junior college if they want to continue to improve their education i want to extend an invitation to my friends on the democratic side to join with us let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty this week"],

million middleclass working americans i have often been asked whether i am at the steel workers hall in hegwish in the south side of chicago or the legion post in joliet or a chamber of commerce or the coffee shop called weits cafe in morris illinois my hometown or the local grain elevator a pretty fundamental question and that question is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married folks back home just do not understand why for almost 30 years we have had a marriage tax penalty which the average is 1 400 each for 25 million married working couples in the south suburbs in the south side of chicago 1 400 is real money it is a years tuition at a local community college for a nursing student it is 3 months of day care it is a washer and a dryer it is 4 000 diapers for a child we need to address the issue of fairness we need to address the issue to wipe out the marriage tax penalty suffered by 50 million married working people it is an issue of fairness here is how it works what causes the marriage tax penalty is when a couple decides to marry when they file their taxes they file jointly when they file their taxes jointly their combined income usually pushes them into a higher tax bracket let me introduce shad and michele hallihan two public school teachers from joliet illinois shad and michele have been married almost 2 years now they just had a baby a wonderful young couple but they suffer almost the average marriage tax penalty now shad and michele have a combined income of about 62 000 suppose that they have an equal income each making 31 000 michele here if she stayed single would be in the 15 percent tax bracket but because she and shad married their combined income of 62 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket creating well over almost the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 we want to help couples like shad and michele michele pointed out to me that the average marriage tax penalty would buy almost 4 000 diapers for their newborn baby should not those couples like michele and shad be allowed to keep money keep their hardearned salary their hardearned income rather than paying a tax just because they are married we are working to address that and i was so pleased that this house of representatives overwhelmingly supported with a bipartisan vote 268 members of the house endorsed wiping out the marriage tax penalty in order to help couples such as michele and shad hallihan h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act passed this house as a standalone bill and addresses one issue the need to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples if we look at who pays the marriage tax penalty one half of them itemize their taxes millions of middleclass families itemize because they own a home or give money to church or charity have education expenses well we wipe out the marriage tax penalty for those who itemize their taxes by widening the 15 percent tax bracket so that joint filers can earn twice as much as single filers and stay in the 15 percent tax bracket that will help shad and michele hallihan for those who do not itemize we double the standard deduction helping those who do not itemize by doubling the standard deduction to be twice that of single people we also help the working poor those who participate in the earned income credit by addressing the income eligibility eliminating the marriage penalty for the working poor as well it is a good bill it helps those who itemize it helps those who do not itemize the primary beneficiaries are those with incomes between 30 000 and 75 000 those who suffer the marriage tax penalty the most we do not raise taxes on anyone we wipe out the marriage tax penalty we help stayathome moms we help those who are homeowners eliminating the marriage tax penalty is a fundamental issue of fairness and that is what it is all about let us make our tax code more fair now this legislation the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 passed the house with 268 votes every house republican and 48 democrats broke with their leadership to support our effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty we have tremendous momentum and my hope is our friends in the senate will follow the lead of the house move quickly to move a standalone bill wiping out the marriage tax penalty not loaded up with amendments or extraneous riders or other poison pills my hope is that they will keep it a clean bill and that they will move expeditiously and as quickly as possible to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for couples like michele and shad hallihan that is what it is all about fairness let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty

hour discussing the details of the vice presidents economic plan certainly during that period of time we will have a broad overview but at this point i would like to just focus very narrowly on one aspect of the vice presidents plan my colleagues may recall that the vice president was one of many voices that urged the president of the united states to veto the marriage penalty tax relief that was passed by this congress and sent to the president soon after the president vetoed the marriage penalty tax relief the vice president announced that he would give marriage penalty relief by doubling the standard deduction i think it is probably worth our while to realize what this means exactly in terms of the vice presidents claim that it is marriage penalty tax relief certainly what it means by way of comparison with the marriage penalty tax relief that was granted by this congress and vetoed by the president the first thing my colleagues should realize is that in the congressional bill written by the republicans and passed on to the president vetoed by the president all married couples irrespective of their filing status received relief from the unfair marriage penalty the vice presidents proposal that he now outlines only gives relief to those people who do not itemize their taxes if a couple owns a home and decides to deduct their mortgage interest they will get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan if a couple gives to their church and deducts charitable contributions they get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan e0 1600 if you your spouse or your child is ill and you deduct your skyrocketing medical bills you get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan if you or your spouse work at home and deduct the cost of a home office you get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan and if you jump through hoops to become eligible for one of the new credits that the vice president has proposed complicating our tax code even further than it is now than the vice president will not give you relief from the unfair marriage penalty and that is wrong that is just the beginning of the serious concern i have with the details of the vice presidents plan let me say it is a commonplace observation in this town that the devil is in the details armeys axiom is if you make a deal with the devil you are the junior partner and i am about to demonstrate in this next hour that indeed the devil that we do not want to make a deal with is in the details of the vice presidents plan let us take a look at the big picture first the vice president would spend the onbudget surplus he would rob the social security trust fund and he would provide a measly tax cut designed to manipulate behavior instead of giving meaningful tax relief one of the things that we are very proud of in this congress one of the things that we have been able to do thanks primarily to the success of the american people in creating an enormous economic success story here in america and the revenues that have accrued to the government out of our economic success is that we have managed to stop the raid on social security not only do we set aside 100 percent of all social security tax dollars that people find in their payroll stubs as fica tax 100 percent of all medicare tax surpluses set aside by this congress thus ending the 40year raid on social security and medicare but we have even managed in this congress to set aside a large portion of the onbudget budget surplus what is the onbudget budget surplus that is the part of the budget surplus that accrues to the government from your social security taxes not from your medicare taxes but from your income taxes so that we are now setting 90 percent of all budget surplus aside for debt reduction the vice presidents plan would take all of that income tax surplus which we call onbudget surplus and he would spend it but worse than that he would renew the old practice a practice that should be forgotten of robbing from the social security trust fund for new risky spending schemes that we will talk about later at the same time he would provide a bureaucratic governmentrun prescription drug plan that is not guaranteed to bring the cost of drugs down indeed the vice presidents onesizefitsall youmustjointhegovernment plan threatens to force the price of prescription drugs up let us address his spending plans first according to vice president gores numbers he would increase federal spending by about 900 billion through the year 2010 however the senate budget committee shows a much highber price tag they added up the numbers and found that the vice president would spend 2 1 trillion of new spending and he would not stop there think of it this way the vice presidents plan is 191 pages that means that each page of his book would cost taxpayers an amazing 18 4 billion per page it means that for every dollar by which the vice president would cut taxes he would spend 6 75 if you look at the details we find that vice president gore dramatically underestimates the cost of his new retirement entitlement program built on top of the social security program that is not new this has been a part of our problem historically in the past with democrat congresses that created new mandatory spending programs and dramatically underestimated their cost the vice president says his new retirement program which is very similar to the clinton universal savings account which was a trial balloon which the clinton administration floated until it popped that this would cost 200 billion over 10 years but an analysis by dr john colgen of stanford university shows that if everyone eligible to participate in it it would cost 160 billion in the first year alone the vice president says his plan would cost 200 billion over 10 years professor colgen of stanford university says if everybody eligible participated it would be 160 billion for the first year alone the vice president mistakenly calls this brand new massive retirement spending program a tax cut true enough it would be run through the irs and that would give this agency still more power and control over the lives of americans but this is no tax cut instead the vice president would give government checks to people some of whom do not even pay taxes our budget rules would score it on the spending side not on the tax side other parts of this big government agenda include massive new spending on energy environment transportation and crime all important items on our policy agenda but to pay for this the vice president would rob the social security system we have stopped that raid on social security and i believe that the american people would agree with me

can individually do as well for themselves government ought not to interfere there is an important role for the government imagine an individual trying to build a freeway alone but it is a role that

families stronger through tax cuts or other programs that may be developed to help our children to use those dollars to fund the medicare program for wealthy senior citizens we would not want to do that this does not make any sense here in the 21st century members might also recall that we had other actions in there including paying down 1 trillion of the national debt and in addition to that tax fairness i must say that it would be a mistake for us not to have passed that earnings limit exclusion program so that our seniors who want to go out who want to work who want to be independent do not lose social security in the process thank goodness we pushed that program through we intend to push other programs like that through including the easing of the marriage penalty so we want to be able to have a process that allows us to pass these tax bills that help various segments of our society and we believe that is consistent with our program to strengthen medicare andto provide a prescription drug benefit what is interesting is that president clinton himself has no prescription drug benefit in 2001 and 2002 in fact he makes very significant reductions in medicare in order to pay for what program he is going to create in 2003 frankly democrats ought to be embracing this program if they would like to see a strengthening of medicare they ought to be really embracing the republican budget because we get about it right away also contained in the democrat motion to instruct are the incendiary words irresponsible tax cuts to me that is an oxymoron there is no such thing as an irresponsible tax cut there are plenty of irresponsible government spending programs but i do not think there is such a thing as an irresponsible tax cut i do not know what we would call an irresponsible tax cut is it something that lets families keep more of what they earn is it something that lets a senior keep more of what he or she earns rather than being penalized through reductions of their social security benefits is a fiscally irresponsible tax cut one that provides relief to married couples if people get married today they can get punished because they get married they pay more in taxes is that fiscally irresponsible how about for a small businessman who works a lifetime to build a pharmacy like my friend max peoples in westville ohio or friends of the gentleman from wisconsin in janesville wisconsin they work a lifetime and then when they die they have to visit the undertaker and the irs on the same day how about reducing or eliminating the death tax so people who work a lifetime can pass their legacy on to their children rather than having to pass it on to the federal government i do not know what it even means when we talk about a fiscally irresponsible tax cut it does not make any sense to me it seems to me as though we ought to stay with the republican budget plan that republican budget plan will keep our mitts off of social security something that my friends in the majority party were not able to do for 40 years it is going to strengthen medicare and provide a prescription drug benefit starting in 2001 i am told it will be very soon that republicans in the house will unveil their bill i hope it will be meanstested we will pay down 1 trillion of the publiclyheld debt by 2013 we will continue to promote tax fairness for families farmers and small businesses there is no reason to fix something that is not broken so i would request that the members on both sides of the aisle defeat the motion to instruct the conferees offered by my

passage of this amendment and that pursuit and that determination is offset by the graciousness of my colleague the gentleman from north carolina and his innate fairness to allow me to speak on his time when he opposes the amendment i thank him for that i want to be simple and to the point here if i can today is a day that millions of hardworking americans have filed their tax returns with the federal government it is a tough day for a lot of people it is also a day that most have come to dread because they feel that the government continues to take their taxes we have created a situation in which many americans do not feel that their government responds to their needs taxes them excessively continuing to spend without regard i hope today is the day we can return some of the confidence in the government to the people the tax limitation amendment will return confidence by promising that the congress will no longer raise their taxes without careful consideration and a twothirds vote in support this would have precluded the passage of a lot of bad socalled tax reform acts there would have to be a strong consensus among members of both parties not just one side to raise taxes making sure it would be a necessity this is a simple straightforward proposition that a number of states have already adopted and a number of others are expected to consider this year including my home state of texas in states that require a twothirds vote to increase tax rates growth in both spending and taxing is lower than in states without it this simple fact is proof that the intent of this legislation can and will accomplish its goal if we just pass it today the amendment would require a twothirds supermajority vote in both chambers of congress to pass any legis lation that raises taxes by more than a minimal amount this resolution would cover income taxes estate and gift taxes payroll taxes excise taxes it would not cover tariffs user fees voluntary premiums and other items which are not part of the internal revenue laws the twothirds standard is reserved for the most important decisions including amending the constitution ratifying international treaties impeaching the president and on and on it is time we elevate raising taxes on the american people to this same high standard that it takes to carry out any of these other obligations i have worked hard to push for a balanced budget amendment and control spending and taxing while in congress the tax limitation amendment makes good sense by restoring discipline to our system which has spun out of control today april 15 we can tell our constituents we will no longer slip tax increases through by slim margins and commit ourselves to a direct yes or no when their pocketbooks are at stake i am proud to join the gentleman from virginia as the lead democrat on this bill i urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass the tax limitation amendment in summation if we ever have a balanced budget amendment we

understand that there is concern that his amendment was made in order but the second degree amendment of the gentleman from pennsylvania was not let me address this directly i have a 100 percent prochoice voting record 1 am second to none in my support of a womans right to choose my record stands for that the coburn amendment says nothing in this section shall apply to negotiations specifically relating to requiring a health plan to cover abortion or abortion services whereas i would not have singled out abortion i would not have treated this in any manner different than any other medical procedure i emphasize to my colleagues that the coburn amendment is a null set there is no evidence of any health care plan any hmo requiring doctors to perform abortion or abortion services i draw to the attention of all of the cosponsors of this bill that the amendment by the gentleman from oklahoma uses the word requiring not permitting this amendment in other words is in my judgment an effort to introduce the topic of abortion into an area where it has no place it is not a substantive amendment let me repeat it deals with a case that has not been shown to existwhere an hmo requires a doctor to perform an abortion in conclusion the gentleman from florida mr goss noted two things with which i would like to take respectful disagreement first of all the concern he expressed for a boycott was addressed by an amendment by the gentleman from new york accepted in the committee on the judiciary so that a boycott is not possible under this bill secondly the cost estimate that the vice chairman of the committee on rules gave was for 10 years but we adopted a 3year sunset for the bill so the cost is substantially less actually its less than one third of the cost that the gentleman from florida estimated with that i conclude with one last request for those who care about this bill for those who care about the 3y years those of us have put into it this is the moment do not let the rule keep us from the merits of this bill it is not a perfect rule i did not wish everything to go into it that has but we will have no other chance"],

offlabel uses of drugs for their cure our plan offers them not only prescription coverage but choice and hope today is a great day for our nations seniors because today we are considering historic legislation that will expand medicare to cover the rising cost of prescription drugs when medicare was created in 1965 prescription drug coverage was not included because there were relatively few drugs available and the focus was on physician and hospital care today however its clear that you cant have modem health care without having access to lifesaving pharmaceuticals thankfully twothirds of seniors have prescription drug coverage under other health plans but 12 million have no coverage at all this is simply morally wrong in the worlds most prosperous nation because no senior should have to choose between filling the prescription they need and putting food on the table so today is truly a red letter day we will pass a house republican bill with bipartisan support to make

we have addressed this issue several times in 1997 i opposed the increase because the federal budget was in deficit and we were proposing massive cuts to programs that everyday people rely upon i was also concerned about the process the house employed in 6onsidering the cola i was unhappy that there was little public debate on the issue and only a procedural rather than a straight yes or no vote in 1999 the procedure was the same again i was uncomfortable and as i did with the 1996 cola i did not accept the increase and returned the net amount to the treasury now many members argue that cola is not a raise per se and that the statute automatically authorizes implementation without requirement of debate or vote several point out that colas for other workers operate in just this fashion this is true it is absolutely correct however we are not like other workers one hundred percent of our costs both for employment and office expenses are borne by the taxpayers we also set our own salaries and we have no direct employer or supervisor except the public in the collective few workers in this country enjoy such circumstances we have the luxury through our own action or in this case inaction to alter the amount of money we earn given that i believe a substantive vote on the cola is the appropriate way to handle the annual increases nevertheless it does not appear that my views are likely to prevail on this issue although i will continue to promote a direct vote i am not opposed to the cola itself i believe that members can justify a 2 7 percent increase in their wages but i also believe that the taxpayers who pay our salaries have a right to ask for that justification in order to do so however they must be able to understand the houses action relative to its compensation
