figure on drug trafficking charges according to unitedstates and haitian exile sources col jeanclaude paul commander of the powerful dessaline battalion in haitis capital has been under suspicion of drug smuggling since 1986 sources say but only recently have investigators compiled enough evidence to proceed with grandjury activity and possible indictment ile would apparently be charged with aiding the flow of colombian cocaine to the unitedstates and of arms from the unitedstates to colombia sources say some sources say an indictment is imminent but given secrecy of the process others are unsure if colonel paul is indicted the case will severely challenge haitian president leslie manigat who has pledged a crackdown on drug smugglers though unitedstates officials were unwilling to discuss the judicial investigation they said an indictment could call into question the arrangements by which mr manigat came to power if he tries to fire paul unitedstates congressional sources say that will view this as a serious litmus test of civilian control in haiti and of how the unitedstates should deal with the new regime pauls unit is viewed as the most important in the country and his troops are fiercely loyal to him unitedstates officials say this makes it very difficult for haitis president or pauls nominal military superiors to move against him wellinformed haitians say paul has warned that he will not go down alone if others try to remove him paul allegedly played a major role in directing violence that upset the november elections in haiti because of close ties to the tonton macoutes the secret police created during the duvalier dictatorship the violence and killing paved the way for manigats election last month paul is seen as very close to the gen william regala who was no 2 man in haitis transitional junta and may be named defense minister he is the muscle and regala is the brain says a haitian opposition source but paul has an independent power base since becoming commander of the dessaline barracks in early 1986 he has assiduously wooed his troopsdining with them wearing fatigues like theirs supplementing their pay with bonuses allegedly funded from drug trafficking washington sources say they will kill at his command a haitian opposition source says paul has also reportedly incorporated several thousand tonton macoutes into his unit making it even more formidable us officials say hes got all the guns one us specialist says washington first raised reports of pauls activities in the transitional haitian government in 1986 but received no satisfactory reply officials say after the initial us complaints an internal haitian military investigation was launched haitian exile sources say the final report reportedly confirmed the charges and included aerial photos of pauls farm with a private landing strip but after the army chief of staff presented it to gen henri namphy the thenacting head of government the investigating officers were reportedly transferred and accused of plotting a coup the army chief of staff and the colonel in charge of the investigation were subsequently forced to retire us officials could not confirm the haltians charges while stressing their lack of knowledge of the us judicial investigation they say earlier us intelligence indicates paul is alleged to have taken over parts of the drugtrafficking ring once reportedly run by the fatherinlaw of mr duvalier pauls brother alexander former haitian consul in miami is reported to have been in that earlier operation and the current one they say colombian cocaine and marijuana were reportedly the staples of this trade informed haitians here say that paul is well tied into the tonton macoutes in part because his father was in the personal entourage of franqois duvalier who founded the group to keep the military and opponents in line pauls reported ill deeds go beyond drugs a reuter dispatch from haiti reports that he and his two brothers arranged to receive the 4 000 tons of waste from the city of philadelphia dumped on the haitian coast line near the port of gonaives in january haiti opposition sources have provided the monitcr with what appears to be an import authorization from haitis minister of commerce for the paul brothers to import 20 million kilograms of usorigin ash free of inspection unloading of the ash stopped after local residents vigorously complained news reports from haiti indicate the waste may contain high levels of dioxin press reports say the paul brothers reportedly received 200 a ton to accept the ash washington will be watching carefully how the haitian government reacts if the indictments are issued the us has cut off all but humanitarian aid and antidrug cooperation with haiti until democratic elections are held senior us officials have made clear that they will judge the new government by its acts us officials believe manigat was elected after striking a deal with the military reports from haiti sources say indicate general namphy who headed the transitional government will be named chief of staff and general regala who was namphys no 2 will become defense minister martial celestine an associate of manigat was named prime minister tuesday us officials an congressional activists doubt that manig can move against paul alone they also wonder if namphy and regaia

districts there are three judicial districts in north carolina in virginia there are two judicial districts south carolina which is a single district has 11 divisions with the l1th having been added in 1986 in west virginia there are two judicial districts at the same time the population of maryland exceeds that of several multidistrict states at the time they gained multiple districts the

monterey bay a marine resource of truly national significance and one of tremendous importance to the people of central california the bay provides a livelihood for fishermen hotel and restaurant workers tour guides and researchers the deep marine canyon which lies beneath its waters provides the habitat and food source for an extraordinary variety of marine life unfortunately this bountiful environment is threatened and unless action is taken to preserve it future generations may not enjoy the opportunities for recreation study and contemplation offered by monterey bay because of its unique biological environmental and economic significance monterey bay was nominated by the state of california for national marine sanctuary status in 1977 and added to the national oceanic atmospheric administrations list of active candidates in 1978 the monterey bay sanctuary site is unique in many ways the site is the only west coast candidate site including a submarine canyon the pacific coasts largest in addition the bay within the proposed monterey sanctuary hosts a number of endangered and threatened species of marine mammals and birds as well as commercial and recreational fisheries and many tourist activities the bay is also the focus of extensive national and international marine research efforts the site was seriously considered as an active candidate until noaa made a decision to remove it from the list in november 1983 unfortunately monterey bay and its vast array of marine life are threatenened unless immediate action is taken to protect them finding during the past few years suggest that the bay and its tributaries are slowly being contaminated by toxic chemicals record levels of pesticides have been found in watsonvile espinosa and elkhorn sloughs as well as the salinas river all of which empty into the bay residues of pesticides banned over a decade ago are still being found at high levels in the soils that drain into the bay at the same time several cities use monterey bay as an ocean outfall source for their sewage and the demand by other cities to do the same is on the rise the decision to remove the bay from the list of active candidate sites was at best arbitrary and at worst misguided the reasons given by noaa at the time bore little relationship to the facts involved it was argued that there were already two sanctuaries offshore california protecting similar resources the large size of the bay was sited as placing an unnacceptable enforcement burden on noaa and finally the argument was made that the bay was already protected by state and local agencies it should be noted that nowhere in the marine sanctuaries act is it contemplated that geographical distribution would be decisive in determining protection or that a coastline as extensive and varied as californias would be limited to the number of potential sanctuaries it should also be noted that a third california sanctuary cordell banks is now pending final approval also no other marine sanctuary protects resources similar to monterey because these resources are indeed unique including the largest submarine canyon on the west coast and an extraordinary variety of marine life including the threatened california sea otter second while the exact size of a monterey bay sanctuary has not been determined it would certainly be smaller than the channel islands sanctuary in southern california500 square miles versus 1 200 finally there is no comprehensive management plan for the bay and it is currently threatened by the drainage of sewage and toxic pesticides the bay faces immediate threats from the proposed establishment of new sewage outfalls by the cities of gilroy and morgan hill and by the proposal by the bureau of reclamation to use the bay for the disposal of toxic drainage water from the san joaquin valley joined by other members of the california congressional delegation i have made numerous attempts to have noaa place the bay back on its list of active candidates unfortunately the agency will not reconsider its position until after the current list of 29 sites has been designated or rejecteda process which will take us well into the 1990s according to the latest communication from noaa the monterey site will not be further evaluated as a national marine sanctuary it is clear that this unique national resource must be preserved and that the threats posed by potential new industrial sewage outflows and toxic agricultural discharges are too immediate to wait for noaa to take action it may never take because noaa has closed the door on attmepts to designate the bay as a marine sanctuary through the established process i am today introducing the monterey bay national marine sanctuary act this legislation would designate the bay as a national marine sanctuary and would require the secretary of commerce to establish a management plan for the bay in accordance with goals and purposes of the marine sanctuaries act monterey bays unique physical and biological qualities its economic productivity and its national cultural and research significance clearly warrant marine sanctuary designation and protection from the growing threat of toxic contamination it is my hope that this legislation will bring about the protection needed for this unique national resource h r 734 be it enacted by the senate and

from new york and play upon them to the extent that this socalled brouhaha over the cia has raged through this body today george bush and republican administrations in general while advocating democracy throughout the world have indeed a very poor record when it comes to upholding democracies in our own hemisphere the public record of cia covert actions against governments duly elected governments i might add in the americas is a very sad history indeed guatemala in 1954 duly elected government overthrown chile 1973 duly elected government leftist though it might have been overthrown nicaragua 1981 to 1988 the cia has a long and a sordid history of undermining governments that we do not like speaker wright has strongly condemned these actions over the years because he believes the american people support the promotion of democracies to free elections and not through covert actions hundreds of thousands of american servicemen fought for their country in world war ii korea and vietnam not to come back to this country and have the cia try to overthrow duly elected governments the speaker is right he is right and he is to be commended for speaking out so strongly and forcefully against cia activity in nicaragua but the speaker today and yesterday has been attacked for stating the obvious and commenting on what has been in the public record for years you know you do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the cia with the backing of bush and reagan have been trying to overthrow the government of nicaragua for the past 7 years it is not me saying it it is not jim wright saying it barry goldwater has said it barry goldwater has berated when he was chairman of the intelligence committee the activities of bill casey for mining harbors in nicaragua and i want to get on to that in just a second not once has president reagan or george bush or anyone in the administration to my knowledge denied that the cia has been up to no good in nicaragua that is because they know it is true and the american people know it as well the american people do not support the cia overthrowing foreign governments they do not support the contras and they certainly do not support the undermining of our constitution that is why despite ronald reagan and george bushs best efforts they have been on tv beaucoup times they have been in this chamber talking before the american people and the congress on more contra aid more than any other single issue that the president has addressed the american people on they have been unable to convince the american people of the righteousness of their policies in fact every single poll with the exception of about 2 weeks during the irancontra hearings has indicated by margins of almost 2 to 1 that the american people look at this policy as a dismal failure if george bush and the republicans think they can turn the issue of nicaragua around and the republican leadership i might add by attacking the speaker for condemning the cia they are gravely mistaken the american people agree with jim wright on this issue and not george bush the speakers comments in regard to the cias attempt to destabilize the nicaragua government are as i indicated earlier part of the public record he has cited nothing more than what is already on the public record the testimony the world court or the iran contra committee and from sources within the administration itself in december 1981 president reagan issued a finding authorizing covert actions against nicaragua and put the cia in charge the actions of the cia have been a source of controversy and part of a long and a very sad record documenting the reaganbush administration to overthrow that government and part of the cias original covert plan was to destabilize the nicaraguan government internally testimony to this effect was given to the world court in 1985 by david mcmichael a former cia official as recently as the 7th of august this year a upi report revealed a 10 to 12 million political account earmarked for nicaraguas internal opposition and how was this information known the cia and state department officials told reporters this is where the leaks are that is where the leak has got to be plugged if there are leaks coming right out of the administration right out of the white house right out of langley how can the reaganbush administration attack the speaker for comment ing on what the american people read every day in their morning newspapers the cia has mined nicaraguas harbors distributed an assassination manual and set up a secret airstrip in costa rica to resupply the contras in at least two instances the mining of harbors and the contra resupply effort congressional bans prohibiting such activities were ignored and the truth was hidden from congress and the american people as my friend the gentleman from new york has indicated and let me if i might for a second cite what has been on the public record about the cia efforts to overthrow the nicaraguan government on april 6 1984 congress learned that the cia had mined the nicaraguan harbors the revelations infuriated republican conservative senator barry goldwater then chairman of the intelligence committee who upbraided cia director casey for not informing congress the mining of the harbor violated the boland amendment that had been adopted that had been adopted in the fiscal year 1984 as a continuing resolution and it stated that no funds available through the cia or the dod or any other agency or entity of the united states involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of supporting directly or indirectly military or paramilitary operations in nicaragua by any nation group organization movement or individual second in september 1984 the public also learned about the assassination manual written by the cia for the contras which advised the selective use of violence to neutralize and everyone knows what neutralize means carefully selected and planned targets such as court judges police and state security officials third when the congress cut off funds for the contras the irancontra affair was perpetrated and a secret supply operation was set up to fund the contras the cia knew about and some of its agencies participated in this effort in fact cia agent joseph hernandez now faces a fivecount indictment by the irancontra special prosecutor lawrence walsh for organizing and directing a resupply airlift that dropped weapons to the contras while he was station chief in the only living democracy in central america while he was station chief in costa rica from july 1985 to december 1986 he is also accused of making false statements to conceal his role in testimony before the tower commission another point col enrilque bermudez one of the most senior officers to have served somoza was anointed by the cia in 1981 to be the contras military director he is now a member of the contra political directorate bermudez has served as the administrative link to the cia throughout his full tenure this is cited in the washington post in july 1988 as recently as may 1988 the cia intervened directly in a contra meeting the contras were meeting to try to get their act together like they do about every 3 months because half of the people leave because they cannot seem to put their act together and it is important to review that cruz robelo chamorro all of these democrats that those members on that side of the aisle were hailing and bringing before us year after year after year they left they got disgusted they are gone as recently as a month ago the cia intervened directly in a contra political directorate meeting on behalf of bermudez who faced opposition from the contras internally the cia agent got on the phone and delivered a 20minute harangue through a remote telephone hookup calling the director who proposed removing bermudez who was by the way mr chamorro who was at one time one of the editors of la prensa the paper those members all hold up with such high standards and which in some instances they are indeed correct for doing but the cia through this phone hookup talking about the removal of bermudez called mr chamorro stupid and an imbecile under an oath in testimony before the world court on september 16 1985 former cia official david mcmichael revealed the outlines of the cia plan to destabilize the nicaraguan government internally a better script for what has happened with the nicaraguans in the last few months could not have been written according to mcmichael who had participated in discussion of the plan that they were to promote crossborder attacks then they would get arrestive opposition and then they would provoke action against united states diplomatic personnel exactly what happend just a few months ago according to a july 7 1988 upi report several million dollars have poured into the coffers of the internal nicaraguan opposition groups in the last year from private conservative groups and cia accounts according to united states officials and participants in the effort according to the article the cia has spent from 10 to 12 million in political accounts earmarked for nicaraguas internal opposition the report was attributed to the cia and state department officials the officials said they had encouraged internal opposition members to take and test the limits of pluralism"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i thank my good friend from california for yielding and requesting this time tonight to pay tribute to our good friend

and her immediate family survived the nazi holocaust in europe those in the immediate family that did not come to this country were all lost in the crematoria of hitlers death camps that fact probably more than any other impressed upon sala the deep commitment to protecting civil liberties civil rights understanding that minority groups that might be discriminated against one day could be hated the next and uncontrolled discrimination and hatred can lead to such enormous evil that she knew we had to act before these kinds of things got out of hand on a personal note i have known sala and phil for close to 30 years when i was a young teenager and belonged to the young democrats in california phil and sai would talk to us when most grownup politicians were not spending any time with the kids about why politics was a noble thing to be involved in why the fights that we were fighting were often so frustrating were important and that we could make a contribution and that we had to keep on trying to make things better when my family and i came to washington the door was always open to us at the burton home 01450 i know that both when i was in sacramento and when we came here our daughter who is now 23 grew up calling sala burton aunt sala there was a very very close bond of friendship between our families on a very personal level they were always there phil and sala to give us some guidance some encouragement some reinvigoration of commitment to try to accomplish in some way the goals they set out for themselves and set as role models for us to try to emulate one of the most touching tributes at the lovely memorial service in san franscisco was given by the speaker of the state assembly another person who has gone back even longer than almost any of us who are involved in public office in his political and personal relationship with phil and sala and that was speaker willy brant he closed his very eloquent remarks by saying that the best memorial tribute to sala burton is to try to act the way saia acted to try to live up to the ideals that she not only personified but urged upon all of us if we in some way could live up to that standard we would be by that example following her example and giving the greatest memorial to her i hope that as we remember fondly the memories of sala burton and the time we have had with her over the years the time that she has been with us in this institution that we will try to live up to the standards that she set for all of us to the goals and ideals that she so strongly and firmly believed in and in that way we will indeed be giving a living memorial to all the work that she has done over the years i do want to indicate that my wife janet had the opportunity to do an interview with sala burton a couple of months ago and i will insert that interview into the record i think it speaks a lot about sala in ways that many people did not know about her particularly her remembrances of the holocaust and very strong feelings of jewish identity and the commitments to the goals and ideals of her religion"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i want to begin by expressing my support for the words of the gentleman from new york who preceded me discussing the tragic situation in haiti he has shown a great deal of interest in and concern for the people of haiti and i think he speaks quite sensibly about what we ought to be doing but i want to talk tonight about the presidential campaign some of the members across the aisle have decided that this is an appropriate forum in which to do campaigning i will have to concede that i have not done the research that some of my colleagues on the side have done and i do not have a lot of quotations to offer it always seems to me that if people want to read those things they can read them on their own i want to talk about some aspects of the campaign that are distressing to me and i know that my friend the gentleman from new york and some others want to join in one of the things that struck me is the extent to which vice president bush feels compelled on important issues to be obedient to the rightwing in this country it is interesting that george bush when he ran for president in 1080 and was defeated by ronald reagan was seen as a more moderate candidate than than ronald reagan and interestingly as we look at the reagan candidacy and look at the bush candidacy we see in the case of george bush in my view much more of a willingness to toe the line than the rightwing sets ronald reagan himself felt rooted in that conservative movement and as one who was confident of his own place in that conservative movement he felt much freer to disagree with people in the conservative movement when he thought common sense required him to do so for instance we had the case of the inf treaty when the great majority of the conservative movement as they call themselves in this country reacted quite angrily to the inp treaty ronald reagan had the selfconfidence to say that they were acting in an even more bizarre fashion than some of them usually do and he went ahead with it george bush unlike ronald reagan is unsure of himself with that rightwing which has become such an important element in the republican party and therefore when the rightwing growls on its key issues george bush unlike ronald reagan is paralyzed and will not disagree we have had example after example this year of george bush being held to a standard by the rightwing which is in my judgment damaging to the country we begin with the choice of his vice president no one outside of his immediate family thinks that dan quayle is qualified to be the vice president of the united states i do not know how his immediate would vote on a secret ballot george bush picked him because he was given a very short list by the far right when ronald reagan had to pick a vice presij nt he did not feel he owed the far right a veto over his choice because he picked a man george bush who did not at that time look that attractive to him george bush of course has spent the intervening 8 years trying very hard to kowtow to the far right so they would no longer be vetoing him people might remember the famous trek george bush made a couple of years ago to speak at a dinner in honor of the late william loeb publisher of the manchester unionleader an extraordinarily virulent unfair rightwing newspaper publisher who had denounced george bush but bush was so eager to win back the rightwing and to release that rightwing opposition to him that he humbled himself before the unionleaders people well george bush had to pick a vice president and unlike ronald reagan george bush felt he could not do anything the rightwing would have objected to so he picked for vice president probably the least qualified nominee for national office on a major party ticket in a very very long time i confess i am not fully cognizant of all the more obscure vicepresidential nominees earlier in this century but of those i can think of in the last 50 years the current vicepresdential nominee dan quayle is clearly the least qualified but that is not even controversial why was he picked because the rightwing gave george bush a short list it had on it a couple of people like our colleague the gentleman from new york george bush did not want to pick him he thought he might be overshadowed so he picked someone the rightwing would accept someone who would not overshadow him so that is how he picked quayle george bush suggested about a month ago that we should not go full speed ahead with the installation of the star wars antimissile device because it is going to cost hundreds and hundred of millions of dollars in violation of the antiballistic missile treaty that was richard nixons accomplishment and it could be destabalizing to our efforts to get a substantial nuclear arms reduction agreement with the russians george bush suggested that and then the rightwing growled then george bush unsuggested it on issue after issue after issue of central importance picking a vice president american defense george bush makes moves that are calculated to please the rightwing and i think that is terribly dangerous it is why we have george bush among other things talking about the relationship between the united states and the soviet union in terms far to the right of ronald reagan ronald reagan has achieved with general secretary gorbachev some real gains one of our great hopes is that we will be able to build on that not out of any love for or trust of the soviet union but out of a recognition that we have mutual interests that we are trying to deal with both the strategic and economic impact of an allout arms race george bush has been forced by his fear of the rightwing to back off on that we had another example in fact this has been a good week for george bush i should give credit where credit is due he has not had to fire one antisemi ie from his campaign this whole week i think that is about the first time in a long time that he has not had to do that no one thinks george bush is himself antisemitic no one thinks that george bush was happy with some of the virulent antisemites who were on his ethnic outreach council why were they there because the rightwing gave him a list and because george bush does not have the political courage or toughness to challenge the rightwing he is a man who is politically paralyzed by fear of the rightwing on a few issues where they do not care they give him a little freedom he can go off on the minimum wage and that is ok he can take a little bit of freedom in another area but on the picking of the vicepresidential candidate the most important decision one can make when hie is about to become a presidential candidate on the question of star wars on relationships with the soviet union on his ethnic outreach council when the rightwing insists george bush is there that i believe is terribly dangerous when you have on the right people like pat robertson and others who have i think moved beyond the plausible in their advocacy when you have this blind unwillingness to recognize that there is a chance to reach based on mutual agreement and mutual interests an arms reduction pact with the russians i think that becomes very frightening so one of the central parts of the campaign that has emerged so far is the extent to which george bush unlike ronald reagan will not deviate in any significant area from the agenda of the far right and unfortunately that is a party that has taken up faction that has taken over more and more of the republican party we have the most extremely rightwing platform coming out of the republican party this year again to the right of where the reagan platforms were in 1980 and 1984 because ronald reagan as a genuine conservative with a sense of his own place was prepared to differ with the right george bush out of his own lack of rootedness politically and out of his own political timidity will not take on the far right they have defeated him too often george bush was for too many times in his career frustrated by the far right and he has decided that since he could not beat them that he will make obeyances to them and he has done that at every critical point in this year and in the last critical years at this point i am pleased to yield to the gentleman from new york my friend who i know has things he wants to add on this general subject"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9993089437484741, 0.9993089437484741, 0, "madam

clearly that it required a lot of tenacity and leadership in the conference to get a reduction of 200 million in the final product particularly because the bill that we are dealing with today touches most districts across the nation it deals with things that are close to the hearts of the people of these united states our parks our public lands our forests the crown jewels in a sense of our nation and the great assets that we should take care of we read about the fire in yellowstone we become aware even more graphically of how important our parks are and how important the care of them is to each of us chairman yates did insure that the important things were taken care of in the bill but nevertheless that it conformed to sound and responsible fiscal policy we have received no letter from the administration this is almost a first that they have not submitted a letter in opposition to the bill i would take from that that there is generally support downtown for what we have produced in this conference i might also add that it is a joy to work with the chairman we work as a partnership with all of the members of the subcommittee in achieving what we think is responsible legislative action we did address some tough issues among those particularly would be housing last week congressman murtha and myself visited the grand canyon national park to look at the housing problems there it is quite clear that there is a great need in housing this is just one example i think that is pretty much true across the board we ask the people who serve in the park service to move around to provide their leadership for this program and yet we do not provide adequately for housing we did as much as we could 10 million we need a lot more because the health and sanitary codes are not being met in many of the parks and it is important in attracting and keeping good people in the park service that we have adequate housing for them i think evidence of how important these parks are is the fact that in the grand canyon alone we had nearly 4 million visitors during the past year many of these visitors come from other countries i was struck as i walked along the rim of the canyon just listening to the many different languages that were being spoken by groups who were visiting there obviously this generates international good will it helps with the balance of payments and it gives people from other nations an opportunity to enjoy the beauties of these united states but we have to have good people managing facilities if we are to have success i am pleased to report that the fee program that was initiated by both the authorizing and appropriation committees is gaining success in this past year we collected 52 2 million in fees this money is being plowed back into the needs of the park service so that we can continue to improve our park experience for those who visit maintenance is another need a recent gao report identified 1 9 billion in needs for maintenance in the parks obviously we could not begin to meet that kind of challenge with the resources available we did however provide a 24 million increase for maintenance for a total of 270 million frankly we had to stretch every dollar the chairman recognized that both in putting together our bill as well as in the conference report we had a lot of requests from members that had to be met because they were sound proposals for enhancement of a facility in their districts but there is much more to be done in maintenance i think the fee program is one of the ways that we can achieve a very desirable goal in that respect i might also point out that programs funded in this bill will generate an estimated 8 4 billion in revenue in fiscal year 1989 i would like to mention the clean coal program the chairman did talk about that but it is an important program we recognized that with the appropriation of 575 million for the third solicitation which will be for retrofit and repowering technologies it is i think the answer to the acid rain question we hear a lot about it today in the news media certainly it is a problem i do not think we need a study to find out there is a problem the real issue is how do we meet this challenge the clean coal program in my judgment offers a responsible way to do that since 1985 we have appropriated 1 5 billion approximately but more importantly or certainly equally important is the fact that the private sector has more than matched and will more than match this 1 5 billion first of all the law requires a 50percent match in most of the projects that have been approved the private sector is putting in more than 50 percent because it too recognizes that this is a viable and responsible way to address the problem of acid rain and more importantly the problem of energy needs a recent article in the september 2d washington post entitled the energy crisis isnt gone highlights the challenge that confronts this nation i would like to quote just a few of the statements in this article because i think it is important that this body address the energy needs particularly in the upcoming 101st congress just a few of the quotes from the article it is steadily becoming clear that the united states is heading toward energy problems that could be more serious and more longlasting than those it experienced in the 1970s just as in the 1970s the problem isnt energy it is oil it goes on to point out the fact that we depend on the middle east and that is a volatile region in 1973 we had a strong domestic petroleum industry and the major electric power expansion underway to substitute for foreign oil we will face our next crisis unarmed our national policies of the 1980s have crippled our domestic energy industries only five percent of the worlds oil reserves are in the united states and yet we have the worlds largest oil demand nearly onehalf of all the oil used by the worlds noncommunist industrialized nations is burned in the united states additionally an article that appeared today in the washington times illustrates a problem that will confront the united states it is good news in the sense that it highlights our soaring productivity and in this article it points out the revival of unitedstates manufacturing competitiveness manufacturing output is up in the last 7 years 3 5 percent output per hour is up 4 4 percent value added up 3 5 percent it points out that our growth in manufacturing productivity has been the highest of any nation with the exception of japan during the 1980s it points out that exports have soared 30 percent all of that means the need for more energy and it is good news because it means more prosperity and it means greater ability to compete in the worlds marketplace but i think the article that appears in the times today highlights the problems we are going to confront in the energy field going back to the post oped piece it says that by the late 1990s we will be importing as much as 60 percent of the oil our economy needs this is particularly frightening as we look at the volatility of the middle east where nearly 70 percent of the worlds oil is located tile report also points out something i think is very important as we talk about clean coal and that is that the use of electricity in the united states has climbed 45 percent in the past 15 years the problem with that according to the article is that there is not a major powerplant under construction in the entire country that was started in the 1980s none are even on the drawing board even though our use of electricity is climbing by more than 4 percent a year utilities are making essentially no commitments to new base load powerplants one of the reasons of course is that we have decided as a national policy not to use nuclear it is very difficult to get approval for nuclear plants and the ultimate result of all of this is that we are going to have to depend on coal or we will have to depend on imported oil i think it would be a great mistake in policy for this nation to have a growing reliance on oil imports so it is vital that we develop a program to burn the greatest energy resource we have namely coal and to burn that coal in an environmentally safe way the clean coal program that we have in this bill and have had in the pasit bills may be one of the most significant policy actions that this body has taken during the past several years i think as we face the crisis in electric power that is coming down the road it becomes even a greater imperative that we develop a clean coal program i am pleased that we were able to get the support in the conference for the third round of solicitations because time is running out as evidenced by the statistics in the article i just quoted and it is indicative of a need to go forward i think it is interesting to note as we talk about the energy crisis and the oil crisis that the proven reserves of coal in the united states today are something like the equivalent of 1 5 trillion barrelsnot billions not millionsbut 1 5 trillion barrels of oil we need to use that resource to do it we need a clean coal program we should save our oil for transportation and i think that the bill that we have before us does achieve that objective it is a good bill it is a responsible bill it addresses the problems it reflects leadership that we had in the conference and the committee i urge my colleagues to support this bill because what we are dealing with today is a priceless resource our public lands onethird of the united states is owned by the people of this nation in the form of public lands and we are people that are responsible for the way in which we manage it it is vital that we recognize their value and i think this bill does it in a very responsible way i would like to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee on an item in the bill if i may"], [0.00031751394271850586, 0.5003175139427185, 1, "the gentleman is correct
