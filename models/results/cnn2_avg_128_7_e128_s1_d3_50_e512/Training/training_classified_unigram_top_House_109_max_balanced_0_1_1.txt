vowed that after the botched federal response to the hurricane that the federal government would do everything it could to help those displaced in the gulf and to finally address the issue of poverty six weeks later the house republican majority is already forgetting about americas most vulnerable this week republicans had planned to cut medicaid higher education food stamps and possibly the earned income tax credit in order to achieve budget reconciliation we heard today that the budget reconciliation has been postponed we are not going to vote on it tomorrow and that is certainly good news i think it is a strong indication that this budget plan was a bad plan for america and that it was in fact going to be used as a method of basically hurting the poor and might have had a direct impact on those hurricane victims but it does not mean that therepublican leadership is not going to try to bring it up again next week when we come back and the problem is that it just is not fair it really is not fair it is inamerican in my opinion to say that we are going to try to pass this budget reconciliation by making cuts in the very programs that impact the people who suffered during the hurricane the republicans are claiming that their budget reconciliation bill is fiscally responsible and will cut the deficit but obviously we could tell from the last special order that is simply not true the budget actually raises the deficit gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest and makes matters worse obviously for thevictims of katrina essentially this is a way of trying to build in if you will the republican tax breaks that primarily go to the wealthy to the special interests to corporate interests that the republicans would try to pass further down the road this year and it is amazing to me that it only took republicans 6 weeks to forget the images of hurricane katrina they are once again putting the priorities of the wealthiest few ahead of the workingclass americans it is now clear that the republicans learned absolutely nothing from hurricane katrina i could go on myself but i have to say that my ideas and my concerns with this budget bill were very much set forth in a washington postarticle or op ed that appeared today by harold meyerson called gunning for the poor and i am not going to read the whole thing or put it in the record but i wanted to highlight some of the things that harold meyerson said because it basically says in probably better language what i just indicated and how i feel and harold meyerson said in this op ed today in the washington post congress is back in session and its gunning for the american poor a revolt of house conservatives has persuaded that bodys republican leadership to offset the increased federal spending going to rebuild the hurricane katrinadevastated gulf coast by h8972 reductions in medicaid food stamps and other programs for the indigent if things go according to plan this week the house will begin to cut 50 billion from those efforts the emerging republican response to katrina apparently is to comfort the drenched poor and afflict the dry for a moment last week it looked as though the republicans were going to enact acrosstheboard spending cuts that however would have meant less money for defense contractors and the highway industry and other contributors to congressional republicans campaigns gop committee chairmen made that point so forcefully that the idea was scrapped the beauty of taking the cuts out of medicaid and student loan programs by happy contrast is that it does not reduce the flow of funds to the republican campaign committees by a single dime even before the rightwing house leadership capitulated to the even further rightwing house rank and file the governments response to katrina already appeared to be driven more by laissezfaire ideology than by need or common sense the administration has opposed efforts by senate finance committee chairman charles grassley to extend medicaid coverage to those katrina survivors who lost their jobs and health insurance in the flood and by suspending the requirements of the davisbacon act that construction workers on federally funded reconstruction efforts be paid the prevailing wage president bush has ensured that much of that work will be done by illegal immigrants as one new york times report on the mexican workers rebuilding gulfport mississippi made abundantly clear the article goes on but the bottom line is and this is what meyerson says at the end the same republican zealots who demand fiscal responsibility by cutting 50 billion for the indigent sick are now also demanding a new 70 billion in tax cuts including the permanent repeal of the estate tax that would chiefly benefit the rich so meyerson basically explains and i think it is abundantly clear the republicans are not trying to make these cuts in programs for the indigent that would essentially help the hurricane victims because they want to balance the budget because mo the defitit is still going to be huge they are basically doing it because they want to build into the budget the opportunity to come back with permanent tax cuts for the wealthy for the corporate interests and this is their way of cutting programs that essentially are crucial for the hurricane victims in order to accomplish that and the amazing thing to me is that we heard president bush just a few days or a week or so after the hurricane struck say that the hurricane showed that there were a lot of poor people a lot of people that were unemployed a lot of people that did not have basic necessities and rather than trying to help them in some way by extending medicaid benefits to them so that if they lost their health insur ance they will still have some health insurance or rather than giving them an opportunity to have a job so that they can help rebuild new orleans or the various towns along the gulf that were impacted by hurricane katrina this administration and this republican congress are just cutting the legs out of any kind of help that those hurricane victims would receive and basically saying we do not care about them all we care about is giving tax cuts to the very wealthy i think it is scandalous frankly and it is another reason why we need an independent investigation of what happened with hurricane katrina a number of my colleagues and i have been coming down here for the last few nights as well as before the congressional break that we had last week and have been saying and so have the media been saying that a bipartisan katrina investigation is needed because the washington republicans the ones who have set up their own committee or investigation on a partisan basis are the same people who are responsible for the problems that we faced in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in other words the bush administration botched what happened in the aftermath of the hurricane and they continue to do things that are primarily for special interests for the people who contribute to their campaign coffers without worrying about the people the victims that are suffering in new orleans and other cities along the gulf so why in the world would we let these washington republicans who control the white house control the senate control the house investigate themselves it makes no sense the only way that we are going to get a true analysis of what is really happening in the aftermath of katrina including what was disqussed today in terms of the unwillingness of the republicans to help the victims in the aftermath of the hurricane is by having a bipartisan commission so that democrats and republicans are both involved in the investigation both can look at what is happening and not have this fake katrina inquiry that would just essentially be a whitewash if you will for what happened in the aftermath of the hurricane i notice that i am being joined now bi some of my colleagues who have been here every night making this point but we are particularly upset with the fact that in addition to not having this bipartisan investigation this bipartisan commission we now face a situation where the republicans want to bring up a budget plan that actually is going to cut the very programs that these hurricane victims need i would like to point out the other night i read a part of an editorial in the new york times which i think says it all about this fake katrina inquiry and i am not going to read the whole thing but i just wanted to read the very beginning and the very end this was in the new york times on september 26 it is called faking the katrina inquiry and it says as the nation reels from ritas devastation along the gulf coast any hope for a thorough investigation of governments gross mismanagement of katrina is quietly ebbing away behind the political levees of washington the white house and the republicancontrolled congress resisting popular support for an independent nonpartisan commission remain determined to run selfserving bogus investigations there is no way to whitewash a hurricane the government dominated by one party should be disqualified from investigating itself just as president bush repeatedly fought the creation of the 9 11 commission till public pressure forced him to yield so should the public now demand that the administration and congress get real about katrina i feel even more strongly about this in the light of this budget reconciliation bill that we understand now has been postponed because the republicans do not have the votes thank god they do not have the votes and hopefully they will never have the vote for this scandal i would yield now to my colleague the gentleman from florida who has been here practically every night making this point"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "a few weeks ago i gave a speech about the importance of apologizing for doing something wrong one of the first lessons that we are taught as children actually our capacity for saying i am sorry is part of what makes us a functioning and civilized society here in washington every time a democrat uses strong rhetoric to condemn the politics or the policies of the bush administration there is a relentless pressure from the republicans for an apology and it continues it continues as a repeated pattern that is repeating itself right now with the karl rove affair democrats are right to be incensed that the presidents chief adviser is alleged to have revealed valerie plame as a cia operative purportedly publicizing this information to get back at plames husband joe wilson for disagreeing with the bush administrations assessment that saddam hussein was to quote vice president cheneys flawed analysis reconstituting his nuclear weapons program maybe my memory is failing me but i do not recall any republicans calling on karl rove to apologize for coldheartedly revealing the identity of a cia operative as part of a political vendetta to get back at her husband nor has the vice president apologized for his mistake about iraqs nonexistent nuclear weapons program which led us into war the personally destructive behavior that republicans have engaged in to protect karl rove and another high ranking bush administration official vice president cheneys chief of staff scooter libby actually might be their way to change the subject to avoid any question about the merits of the iraq war and how it has been so poorly managed why do they want to avoid that discussion because the american people have completely lost confidence in the administrations iraq policy where for example is the apology for the deaths of more than 1 700 americans not only is there no apology secretary rumsfeld could not be bothered to personally sign condolence letters to their families where is the apology for sending young men and women to war without the proper protective armor on their bodies and on theirvehicles where is the apology for pinching pennies on veterans health benefits when these brave soldiers return home where is the apology for the immoral doctrine of this preenptive war and where is the apology for the gross deceptions used to justify it for the missing weapons of mass destruction for the cooked intelligence for the phony al qaedasaddam link where is the apology for wasting more than 200 billion for taxpayer money on this mistake and for the poor leadership that led to torture of prisoners and prisoner abuse at abu ghraib in guantanamo where is the apology for committing our troops and our nation to this mission without a postwar plan to secure the eace where is the apology for the arrogance that squandered americas international goodwill and damaged our relationships with our closest allies and finally where is the apology for revealing the identity of a good mans wife just because he disagreed with the administration on policy grounds there is something wrong with our moral compass if we have to apologize for speaking bluntly while our leaders can commit the biggest foreign policy blunder since vietnam and get away without apology or accountability to tell the truth an apology would not be enough for everything they have done an apology after all is just more words it is time for action it is time for accountability and it is time for karl roves security clearance to be revoked it is time for a tangible admission that the iraq war was immorally conceived and has been incompetently managed it is time for an end of the politics of personal destruction and an end of destructive national policies if the president wants to earn back the nations trust he needs to end this shameful shameful chapter in our nations history and without apology he needs to bring our

relationship with a lobbyist fortunately the american people were not fooled by this stunt they saw the new rules for what they were nothing more than an attempt to protect a powerful republican leader finally after media and public outcry became too much for the republican majority to endure republicans agreed to reinstate the old bipartisan ethics rules however it is important to remember

tell you how many times the members have come to this floor with the rubber stamp in their hand and i am going td tell you i am going to show you what that rubber stamp looks like in reality because i want to make sure that the members that are checking this debate out see exactly what we are talking about this rubber stamp comes in the form of a voting card this is my not only id but voting card and the president wants to give tax breaks that we cant afford to billionaires done let me vote for it the president said that we should give unprecedented tax breaks to big oil companies in the time they are making record profits done let me vote for it that is fine whatever the president wants so shall he spell it out we will rubberstamp it and endorse it should we deal with issues as it relates to no plan for a war in iraq president said we should done that is what the republican congress is saying and so here on the democratic side we are saying hey you know something and this thing that we call a democracy we talk about a threetier government we talk about a legislative branch we dont have to talk about it it is in the unitedstates constitution we have an executive branch and we have a judiciary if the american people want to do away with the republican rubberstamp congress you know what to do you want to see this rubber stamp thrown out the back door then you know what to do if you want members to come with their voting card to vote on behalf of the american people and not the special interests and what the white house has said that should be done you know what to do because the thing about it and the only thing that i feel good about these days is that november is coming soon and that the american people are so fed up that maybe just maybe and i think we are beyond maybe right now with the scare tactics that will be coming from special interests because they know their day is coming their day is coming with the american people and we will have tax breaks real tax breaks for the middle class we will have an energy policy that we will say will be energy independent in 10 years they know that will happen they will also know that we will have a true prescription drug and a true health care policy that small businesses and large businesses will be able to provide health care for their employees and that will be done they know that we will also move with a payasyougo policy and not a borrowandspend policy from foreign nations that will also happen and so i think that it is important that everyone understand that we are here on their behalf as i say as i get ready to close i think that it is imperative that the members understand that this is fact and not fiction if it was fiction i could not walk around this chamber and this house of representatives and this capitol and speak to members on a dayinanddayout basis it is not personal it is just business and it is the business of the american people let me get the chart here so that i can make sure that members can get more information housedemocrats gov 30something you can get all the charts that we have shared with you here today and the reports that is housedemocrats gov 30something we encourage emails and anything that members want to share with us what is very unfortunate is the fact that on the eve or last night at 12 midnight the clock ran out on seniors here in the united states of america as it relates to the prescription drug plan on that night when there should have been great celebration by the republican majority what was going on going back to the movie wag the dog no lets talk about immigration on the deadline of the signup time for prescription drugs so that goes to show you mr speaker that it is something their trying to change the debate of the deadline and seniors being confused and now seniors being penalized the next day after and so i just want to make sure that the members know that there are some people that are paying attention to what is going on and they are called the american people and you do have time to change and you do have time to bring about this paradigm shift but history doesnt speak to it and so with that i would like to thank the democratic leadership for allowing me to come to the floor with another 30something hour we look forward to being back on the floor tomorrow if we have the opportunity"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9955645799636841, 0.9955645799636841, 0, "i appreciate the privilege and the honor of addressing you here on the floor of the house of representatives i was listening to the presentation by the 30something group here over the last hour and quite often it redirects the message that i intend to come down to this floor to discuss and of course this evening is no different being a proud and committed member of the republican party and when i hear continually the message rubberstamp congress rubberstamp congress come out over here andin the same breath the question the president wants to privatize social security i dont know anybody that has advocated for the privatization of social security i dont think you can find any seated member ofthe republican congress or the president himself that has said i want to privatize social security so that is a scare tactic that is designed to spook people but it surely is not something that is an objective revelation of the truth the president did though invest significant capital in reform of social security it was the centerpiece in his second inaugural address and after his second inaugural address with great optimism and enthusiasm the president went out and invested month after month after month in an effort to reform a social security program that will ultimately collapse reform it for not for the senior citizens there was nothing in his proposal for the people who were 55 year old and up there is not a way that we can make the actuarial numbers change that we keep our faith and keep our sacred covenant with the senior citizens that is something that is clear throughout everybody in this republican conference and all the people that are involved in this policy that i know of keep the faith with the senior citizens i represent perhaps the most senior congressional district in america iowa has the largest percentage of its population over the age of 85 of any of the states in the union and in the congressional district that i represent the 32 counties in western iowa i have 10 of the 12 most senior counties in iowa so i will argue that i represent a higher percentage of seniors perhaps than anyone else in the country and yet they understand that we will keep our sacred covenant with the seniors we will hold those benefits together there was nothing proposed by the president nothing introduced by any member of this republican conference that would have reduced by a single dime one single benefit to any senior citizen what was proposed was that a portion of young peoples contributions to social security could go into a personal retirement account a controlled account the kind of an account that would be an approved account that would be the same thing as the federal retirement investment funds that many of us are part of many federal employees are a part of in fact all of them that have the ability to direct some of their funds into retirement do invest into that it was a wise and a prudent proposal it was something that looked downrange we know that social security starts to go into the red in about 2016 2017 there is 1 7 trillion in th6 social security trust fund it is only a promise they are only ious in a filing cabinet in parkersburg west virginia that money will have to be paid back out of the labor of our children someday but the surplus growth stops in 2017 and it begins to decline until about 2042 where it is gone 0l 2145 at that point something has to happen the presidents looking downrange a lot of us have looked downrange we didnt get to change the social security program as much as we would have liked to we didnt propose to for our senior citizens because you simply cannot do that because there is not time to grow funds so the proposal was for whom i will submit the proposal that the president burned up so much precious political capital on was for the 30something group and the 20something group and the teensomething group and the youngerthanteensomething group and for all generations yet to be born in america to be able to own a part of their own future to be able to invest that and to be able to count on the same type of returns we have guaranteed as a sacred covenant to our seniors that is what that is about and that is why it is so ironic that the 30something group has rejected the very thing that is designed for their generation and mischaracterized it in a very cynical fashion and called it the privatization of social security it is anything but but it would be and it is still the best and only legitimate policy that has been offered before this congress that can bring us out of almost certain bankruptcy of social security downrange at a point where it will not be a factor to our senior citizens but for the 30something group who have rejected it and decided to scare everyone in america for cynical political reasons the statement was also made by the gentleman from florida that the only party that has balanced the budget is the democratic party and that was without a single republican vote how can a statement like that be passed off here on the floor and not be challenged we know when the budget was balanced it was balanced after and only after republicans took the majoritsr in the united states congress and that happened in 1994 i will say that the young people that came in here in this congress and took over the majority in 1994 were committed fiscally responsible people that came here to make a difference and they did they squeezed that budget down they challenged president clinton and they took this thing down to thepoint where president clinton refused to allow a continuing resolution that would have kept the government operating the government was shut down not because republicans spent too much money but because they hadnt spent enough money and so the challenge laid government was shut down who would have to give in finally republicans said okay we will give you a little more money mr president if that is what it takes to keep the government running to keep things open to keep services going to needy people we will keep the government running by giving you some more money and in spite of that they still balanced the budget the republican majority in this congress balanced the budget in spite of president clinton not because of him and it sure in the world was not without a single republican vote it was only with republican votes i guess i will say that it was with relublican ladership and republican votes and perhaps some on the other side of the aisle did vote for that they might make that argument so i will just concede that point but it surely wasnt democrats balancing this and it wasnt without a single republican vote again the allegation a streamline of rubber stamping think about that statement a streamline of rubber stamping this republican congress rubber stamping the president if that had been the case the 30something group and the rest of america would have had social security reform they would have had the kind of program that would have allowed the younger generations to take a portion of their contributions and invest them so that they could ensure their own financial security if it had been a rubber stamp congress the president would have gotten what he wanted with social security reform and i would have loved to have given it to him because it was a good plan and a good proposal but there wasnt a rubber stamp because there were enough republicans that were i will say attacked relentlessly in their political campaigns by these kind of scare tactics that intimidated them to the point where they backed away from the social security reform and we didnt quite have the 218 votes to do the thing that was best for america no rubber stamp for the president because this congress does think for itself it is 435 independent minds and it is 230 or 231 republicans that absolutely come here with a mission in mind and they draw their own conclusions they represent their districts and they represent the people in their districts and their carry their values here we didnt have enough of a consensus and i am frustrated i would have liked to have rubber stamped that because i had a chance to look at it and it was a good program but we couldnt do it then if this is a rubber stamp congress it seems to me that the president came before the american people on about january 6 of 2004 and he made a speech that i will call the guest worker speech and it was a major policy speech on whatthe president would have liked to have seen with immigration now he did speak somewhat to enforcement but i never got the thread in that speech that that was the message at all he wanted a guest worker temporary worker program and he said without that we cant enforce the law on the rest of the criminals and the drug dealers that are coming across the border i dont agree with him on that i think we have to cut down on that huge 4 million annual number of illegals that huge human haystack coming across the border and we have to seal the border we have taken steps to do that today but if the president would have had a rubber stamp congress he would have long ago when he asked for a guest worker program from this congress and he went out hustling across this country speaking over and over again of the need for a guest worker and temporary worker program he would have had that he would have had it a long time ago if this had been a rubber stamp congress so there are three powerful things really wrong with the earlier statements the rubber stamp itself is utterly wrong we would have had social security if it had been a rubber stamp congress and we would have had a guest worker program if it was a rubber stamp congress it was not and those are probably two of the highest priorities the president has brought to this congress in the 109th congress and neither one are law today or likely to become law any time soon let me say also that when i listened to the gentleman from florida say we have to rewrite that cartoon that is a caricature that comes out here on the floor of congress on a regular basis he says i also have some facts over here well i dont think the word also is going to apply because from what i saw they were not facts they were not even solid opinions then another statement that was made by the gentleman from florida was we dont have health care in america we dont have health care in america there is nobody in america that doesnt have health care everyone has access to health care including the 12 or 22 million illegals that come into this country and show up at our emergency rooms everyone has access to health care no one is denied emergency health care yes there are people that are uninsured and maybe more would be insured if someone was ever denied health care but they are not because we are a compassionate nation and we take care of people in this country we do not slam the door at any clinic or any hospital in the emergency room when people need help we at a minimum stabilize them and generally we provide them with adequate care as a matter of fact it isnt just people in america that have access to health care it is people that live on our borders i~ho have access to free american health care a case in point would be that several months ago i was down on the southern border at sasabe arizona and there at the port of entry station as i walked in there to talk to some of the border patrol officers and as i was speaking with the commander of that shift we had only spoken for a minute or two when he got an emergency call and he said excuse me i have to take care of this so he stepped away and made some calls and when he came back he said well there has been a knifing on the other side of the border just within a mile or so there is a community on the south side there that comes right up to the border and yes it is a smugglers community and it swells by about 2 000 during the day and those 2 000 disappear at night and a new bunch comes back again they smuggle drugs through in holes through our border a couple points to the east and a couple points to the west of that port of entry that allows legal traffic through and perhaps 150 to 180 vehicles a day come through that port of entry at sasabe arizona and the estimate is that two crossings east and two crossings west all four of them have more illegal traffic than there is legal traffic going through sasabe but there when i stood in sasabe arizona there was the emergency call the commander of that shift made the calls and found out that there had been a fight on the other side of the border and likely was over a drug deal and that there was a young male individual say in his early 20s who was knifed over there and the ambulance was coming from mexico into the united states so our border patrol agent and this being a routine act that happens as he told me perhaps four times a quarter so 16 times a year what are the odds i would be standing there when that happened but he made the calls routine he called two unitedstates ambulances to come to that port of entry to meet the mexican ambulance that was coming across the border and he called the helicopter out of tucson to come down and pick him up so they could life flight that person of questionable character who had been knifed in a fight that was likely over a drug conflict life flight him up to the university mercy hospital at tucson well as i stood there we talked about that and the two ambulances he had called from the unitedstates arrived i would say shortly after the ambulance came in from mexico it was about 15 minutes for the ambulance from mexico and perhaps 25 minutes for the ambulances to come from the unitedstates to that port of entry the mexican ambulance was just simply a meat wagon it looked like an ambulance on the outside on the inside there was a gurney and a wounded young male that had been knifed underneath the rubs up into the liver at the time they didnt know if he had a punctured lung or not but he needed oxygen the unitedstates ambulances had oxygen the mexican ambulance did not the mexican ambulance had surgical gloves and maybe a touch or two of bandages here or there no medicine no oxygen hardly anything to treat him with so the unitedstates ambulances came in they put oxygen on him stabilized his condition and got him to where he had as much care as they could provide then the helicopter landed they loaded him on it and took him off to tucson to the intensive care unit up there this was a mexican national wounded in a fight in mexico brought into the united states for health care through the port of entry and the word is paroled to the hospital in the united states for the purposes of saving his life and the medical people did save his life and i dont object to that i dont think you can let people die we do not let them die we dont let them die outside the emergency rooms of our hospitals or our clinics in fact we bring people into the united states on a parole to give them free health care in order to save their life because we are a humanitarian nation the statement that we dont have health care in america couldnt be more false not only do we have health care for everyone in america we have health care for people that are wounded outside of america and brought in here when we know there isnt a chance in the world they will pay a single dime for that and by the way i went to the hospital the next day to visit that individual and i looked at the accounting on the cost and it was roughly 30 000 to fix him up and send him back to his home country he was a rough looking individual but he looked a lot better the next day than he did the night he was knifed in the liver so health care for everybody in america health care for people outside of america it is false to say people dont have health care the picture of the handshake between prime minister nouri almaliki and mahmoud ahmadinejad because they shook hands somehow the implication is or the 30something group would have you believe that that is some kind of a bond between iraq and iran and now they are going to conspire against the united states for what purpose first i would submit that i have shaken hands with a lot of people and i generally smile when i do that i would wonder if there is anyone that serves in this congress out of the 435 that hasnt at some point shaken hands with their opponent in their political race doesnt mean they are your enemy they are not they are just your opponent but we shake hands with all kinds of people and the implication cannot be drawn because that two national leaders shook hands that omehow they are conspiring not at all what one can presume from that is that they have diplomatic relations and those diplomatic relations then can turn into something good rather than something bad from 1980 until 1988 the iranians and the iraqis fought each other and over a million people were killed in that conflict i dont think anyone in the world wants to see that again i am glad they are shaking hands i dont expect they are conspiring in fact i dont think so because i listened to the speech that was given here on the floor of this congress by prime minister nouri almaliki and the statement was made by the gentleman from florida that the prime minister said bad things about israel here on this floor so i took the trouble to download the speech and read every single word in this and looked for any reference to israel whatsoever good or bad 2200 i am going to include this for the record and challenge anyone in america to find a reference to israel in this speech by prime minister maliki if they can find some oblique reference iwould be very interested in what he might have said that could be interpreted by the gentleman from florida as being a bad thing about israel as i read through the speech i found some interesting statements that should be brought up rebuttals to the remarks made as the picture was held up here tonight one of the statements by prime minister maliki was speaking of september 11 your loss on that day was a loss of all mankind and our loss today is a loss for all free people he continued and wherever humankind suffers a loss at the hands of terrorists it is a loss of all humanity we are bound in this together he continued it is your duty and our duty to defeat this terror iraq is the front line in this struggle and history will prove that the sacrifices of iraqis for freedom will not be in vain iraqis are your allies in the war on terror do you think admadinejad might have downloaded the speech he has to be aware of this because this speech was as public as anything that the prime minister of iraq has ever done i am proud of the words he spoke here and lie could feel that he meant it he spoke about history will record the bravery and the humanity but he said the fate of your country and ours is tied the fate of iraq and that of the united states is tied should democracy be allowed to fail in iraq and terror permitted to triumph then the war on terrof will never be won elsewhere this statement made by prime minister maliki here on the floor of this congress not that long ago july 26 2006 is a seminal statement of this global war on terror and the seminal statement of the political campaigns that are going on between now and november 7 because the american people need to understand what happens if ve dont persevere and ultimately succeed with a free country in iraq prime minister malikis statement the fate of our country and yours is tied should democracy be allowed to fail in iraq and terror permitted to triumph then the war on terror will never be won elsewhere think of the implications of that statement the war on terror will never be won elsewhere if we should not persevere in iraq as many on this side of the aisle would like to do sack up their bats and go home that is the attitude i pick up they are trying to convince us we cannot prevail in fact i happened to have read at least significant parts of von clausewitzs book on war he states that the object of war is to destroy the enemys will and ability to conduct war the enemys will and ability to conduct war i reduce that down into the steve king vernacular which is a war is over when the losing side realizes they have lost there is will and ability as stipulated by von clausewitz in his book on war and part of the object of war is to destroy their ability militarily to conduct war and to destroy their will when they run out of men and material it breaks their will down but the strengthi of the will to conduct war is an integral part of the strength of a nation if you can break down that will it is cheaper to break down the will than the military it is cheaper in lives it is cheaper in treasure so a very essential part of conducting war is to destroy the enemys will to fight instead we have people on the floor of this congress that continually every opportunity they get come down here and they must forget at least that is the best characterization i can come up with they must forget when they speak here their words are taken down and their words are reflected across through the internet their words are transmitted around the world and the leaders of our enemy al qaeda and other terrorist groups as well as their rankandfile members ate watching on aljazeera they are watching on the internet they are watching as these words unfold and they are encouraged by the words of defeat that i hear on the other side of the aisle in the end it costs american lives but prime minister maliki of iraq said the war on war will never be won els ewhere should we allow ourselves to fail in iraq imagine if we deployed troops out of iraq pulled them back inside this shore curled america into a fetal position and guarded every school every baseball game and football game every bus stop and hospital and still watched the attacks come especially on our women and children turn the united states of america into one huge israel but no matter where terrorists attack us we could never launch another foreign exposition because politically we could not get it out of this congress because they would point and say it is another iraq look we lost in iraq some of the people on the other side of the aisle went to iraq and surrendered before we liberated them now they are redefining what failure is and saying i predicted it we cannotlet this country fail we have a destiny that we need to fulfill and that destiny promotes freedom throughout the globe and throughout the ages maliki said in his speech iraqis have tasted freedom and we will defend it absolutely he was interrupted with thunderous applause for that statement and he reached out to us and let us know that it is radical islam not islam that is our enemy he gave us a line from the koran he said god says in the koran notice he referenced god surely we have honored all children of adam the brotherhood of man and woman is tied together in the reference to the koran made by prime minister maliki he said i believe these human rights are not an artifact a constyuct reserved for the few they are a divine entitlement for all what an american vision what a statement to make on the floor of congress it resonates with patriotic americans it resonates with all people he continued it is on this unwavering belief that we are determined to build our nation a land whose people are free whose air is liberty and where the rule of law is supreme he continued and said this is the new iraq which is emerging from the ashes of a dictatorship despite the carnage of extremists a country which represents international conventions and practices noninterference in the international affairs of others just a portion of this speech nothing in here about israel there is plenty in here about freedom and about the aspirations of a newly freed people as i have looked them in the eye over in iraq in the times that i have been there i have seen that desire to build a country and a nation i gave a speech to the baghdad chamber of commerce on a hot august day and they asked me shortly before we arrived at the hotel in baghdad it was the hotel that was rocketed while wolfowitz was there some few years ago and so i said yes it fits in my schedule i will do that i walked in the room the count was 57 iraqis and members of the chamber of commerce sitting at their dinner tables they started to introduce me but time was short i wanted to know where is my interpreter they said we dont have an interpreter this chamber of commerce speaks english i thought that is quite unusual to be in a country like iraq and be able to address a group of people 57 strong business leaders in baghdad and have them all speaking english i gave a speech and they laughed at the right time and had the right reactions they spoke english they came up afterwards and surrounded me with their business cards and desire and ideas to rebuild iraq it was encouraging to watch the spirit within then if they can get the oil out of the ground and get the revenue stream coming back into that country they will be a long way along in their recovery the argument that this is a situation when we go alone repeated over and over again the gentleman from florida made that statement we went it alone in iraq i have been over to iraq a number of times i remember standing in the headquarters of the coalition forces in basra general dutton of the british army was there as we stood there and had an informal conversation i began looking at the flags on the shoulders of the soldiers the coalition troops have the same uniform with their flag on the shoulders i took pictures so i could remember which nations were represented and i can remember a few great britain yes the netherlands yes romania was there the australians were there the poles were there the danes were there there were probably three or four other countries represented just in a random group that were standing around there the coalition forces i dont think the gentleman from florida went to visit the coalition forces he visited the american troops and forgot there were thousands of troops there that came from other countries and have been in iraq from the beginning and have stayed there in fact the japanese sent 1 000 troops into iraq because they understand the value of freedom even though they are a relatively passive nation then the half a dozen or so generals that disagree with the presidents policy in iraq and the continued argument that the president did not listen to his advisers and now they have these retired generals that say we should have done this or that the president has always listened to his advisers and generals he understands he is not going to call these shots from the oval office he is going to say you are going to have what you need to get this job done but six generals it appeared to me there are a few more but that is the count that i had they appear to be positioning themselves for some future role in politics if we watch them i believe we will see one or more emerge as at least an adviser to a presidential candidate if not a presidential candidate themselves but i will see your six generals and i will raise you 9 000 30somethings there are 9 000 generals in the united states military and they stand with the commander in chief so you have a long way to go to convince me that just because you find six folks with political aspirations we should alter our entire mission in iraq to accommodate them they would find something else to be critical of and the most outrageous statement of all from the gentleman from florida we have a plan in the war in iraq his question to republicans was where is your plan well i think maybe he got that script wrong i think he probably understands that we do have a plan in the war in iraq it is the commander in chiefs plan i support it i suppdrt moving towards freedom for the iraqi people my question is 30something democrats people who think republican is a fourletter word where is your plan and i would further submit that after 60 minutes of that kind of diatribe i wonder what the suicide rate in america is mr speaker actually i came here to talk about a different subject matter what i want to talk about is the accomplishment that we made here on the floor of congress today and that is for a long time the american people have understood something that has taken quite awhile to go through to this congress and the white house that is we have porous borders in america the american people understand when they see people show up in their streets taking jobs in their communities and when children are coming into their schools and they are born in a foreign country and they dont have the kind of documents that would demonstrate that they have come in through a legal channel and they start to see 1 000 of them show up and take jobs and in iowa for example it would be in our packing plants there is a real large social movement going on the blastosphere opened up and began to tell america the facts of it all and some of people came down to the floor of the congress and made this case my good friend tom tancredo among those the people understood this immigration issue long before congress was able to react we need to be in a position to lead not to follow but this time i think we are following the lead of the american people and i am happy to do that although i would like to be a little more up front but that message came to this floor over and over again led by tom tancredo of colorado and a number of the rest of us stepped in and joined him we have been cafrying that message consistently at heart now for a number of years for me it is 4 years here in this congress carrying this message i sent out a survey into my congressional district it will be 2 years ago last march and it went to 10 000 households randomly selected by a computer so it would have been democrats independents and republicans scattered across the district in a random location and it was a survey on immigration i knew what i thought i believe we need to enforce our immigration laws seal our border force all traffic to ports of entry and birthright citizenship and the anchor babies shut off the jobs magnet do all those things and a lot of people go back home i believe a lot of people do that i believe the record is replete with statements to that effect and a number of pieces of policy that add to that overall philosoplfy but the immigration survey that i sent out to the number of 10 000 randomly selected households asked a whole series of questionsabout immigration that was the only subject matter the most significant question that i asked in that survey was on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most intense how intensively do you agree with this statement and then the statement reads in the survey that we should eliminate all illegal immigration and reduce legal immigration reducing legal immigration is not something that i have actually called for but and all illegal immigration reduce legal immigration and how intensively do you agree with this with 10 being the most intense out of 10 000 mailed we received 1 800 and i think the number was 96 respondents so a number that approached 19 percent returned which is about 3 times what your average return rate would be on that kind of a mailing on that question we should end all illegal immigration and reduce legal how intensely do you agree 82 percent put down 10 82 percent some of them must have held their pen like a dagger the way they wrote their notes and their comments on the surveys as i went through those and read them through 82 percent said end illegal immigration all of it reduce legal by the time you added the 7 8s 9s to those 10s 97 percent agreed with that statement and only 3 percent had an opinion down on the other side of the scale only 3 percent i would submit that if i sent a survey out to the district with a random selection like that and i said steve king says the sun comes up in the east do you agree or disagree i do not believe i would get a 97 percent agreement out of my congressional district but 97 percent want to have border control and they want to have enforcement that is what we tried to provide in this congress and we have made some significant progress last august 22 1 have to back up it was a year ago last august 22 is a little over a year ago i hosted an immigration summit in iowa i started out in des moines with radio and a lot of print coverage and some video coverage on there i had a host of very good speakers on the immigration issue tom tancredo came my good friend from arizona and powerful leader on the subject j d hayworth from arizona jim gilchrest was there who was the original founder of the minutemen we had other speakers that added on to that and one was the father of a son who was lost in the september 11 attack in new york kris eggle and they spoke about the importance of enforcement of immigration laws but if we had done so we may be and likely could have thwarted the attacks on but what happens to this country if we continue our porous borders on that day i stood up and said i want to build a fence i want to put a physical barrier on this border and i want to do it for 2 000 miles for starters i would put a 10 foot high chain link fence and i would top it with barb wire i said barb wire because i am kind of a farm country young guy the press printed it as razor wire i dont take issue with that probably razor wire makes a little more sense than barb wire but i would put the fence there i would move it about 100 feet and i would build a concrete wall that i designed and demonstrated on this floor in congress it is unlikely that i will get an opportunity to demonstrate that tonight but thats the position that i took august 22 2005 i have here with me the clippings from some of the newspapers after that they were not very impressed with that idea they thought it was a kind of radical reactionary and ineffective proposal so there are about four articles here that have reference to that and they mostly undermine my position and seek to ridicule me for having a apparently narrow mind and not having thought this through what this they forgot that i go to the border i look at the circumstances down there i gather the data i talk to the border patrol personnel i talk to the people that live there i talk to the retired border patrol personnel i see the carnage i see the litter i go to the national parks and talk to the park rangers there when they have human traffic that is streaming across that border and the numbers that they are and i sit down there on the border in the dark for hours utterly quiet and listen listen when i cant see but just dim shadows is all that i can see i can hear vehicles coming from the mexican side of the border and they stop by a big mesquite tree about 150 or so yards out there south of the border the fence is just a fine barb wire fence the wires are stretched apart in places that is where the illegals go through they dont fix it back up as one could imagine they leave it open for others there was a water tank that was there on the mexican side that is there that was where they can get their last load up of water before they start off on 20 25 miles of desert on the unitedstates side to be picked up the highway a ways i sit there and listen and i hear the vehicles come down through the desert on one particular vehicle i could hear the muffler dragging all the way along they get by that mesquite tree and they stop and the doors open then you have to listen and you can hear the sounds and it is people clearly pil ing out of the vehicle you can hear them drop their packs on the ground as they get out and they must be picking them back up again you 6an hear a little bit of talk a little bit of whisper then they start off through the mesquite to come out into the border to come into the united states you can hear theif packs go through the fence and be set on the ground on the other side and sometimes occasionally dropped on the ground you hear them climb through the fence they pick their packs back up you can see the shadows you cant quite count them you can see the image of the shadows as they go off and into the desert off north following whatever kind of a beacon they have and may be watching however they guide themselves to go on into the united states now this happens across that border on an average night of perhaps 11 000 people pouring across that border a night 11 000 to the tune of 4 million a year how do i know this i serve on the immigration subcommittee i sit in on hearings two three four times a week witnesses that come forth they are both expert on the matter both pro and con experts that bring real data to us the border patrols information is this that they stopped last year 1 188 000 illegal border crosiers 1 188 000 what a huge number santa anas army was only 6 000 strong and the border patrol stopped 1 188 000 what a huge universe of people that is theoretically at least they turned themselves and said go back through there and many of them they took down to the turnstile and watched them as they went back in mexico the year before the border patrol stopped 1 159 000 so i asked the question of the border patrol and of their representative what percentage of the attempts across the border do you intercept what percentage of success do you have the answer that i get back consistently is 25 to 33 percent when i go down to the border and i ask the border patrol that is actually doing the work down there what percentage are you interdicting and they give me answers like the most consistent answer i got was 10 percent i dont know if that really is it one of them when i said 25 percent broke up in hysterical laughter he said no that number is closer to 3 percent of the drugs and 5 percent of the illegals now that was an ice inspector that should know even if they are wrong now if they are right it is more than 10 million a year if they are wrong and the testimony of 25 to 33 percent and this is all a guess admittedly then it is perhaps 4 million a year coming across our southern border now how many go back we dont know the answer to that either we know some go back we dont know if it is big numbers as a percentage but we know it will be big numbers because there are 4 million or so that do go across we also know that 65 billion that is billion with a b dollars worth of illegal drug come across our southern border every year ninety percent of the illegal drugs in america are coming across our southern border sometimes they come across in semis sometimes they come across in straight trucks sometimes they come across in pickup trucks in fact while i was down there they interdicted a pickup truck that had a false bed in it about 7 inches of false bed underneath there there were 18 bags of marijuana about the size of a cement sack perhaps weighing about 10 pounds each i will submit 180 to 200 pounds of marijuana underneath the false bed in the pickup we took the jawsoflife and pried it open went in there and pulled those sacks out the driver i am going to tell you i believe was a ms13 gang member the most violent gang we have ever seen in this hemisphere the gangs that behead and dismember and do other things so atrocious i will not repeat them on the floor of this congress this individual had a ms13 tattooed on his arm here he had tattoos from his waist to his neck he had every look about him as an ms13 he was perhaps a decoy because they get so many interdictions of drugs down there they cannot prosecute them all so they will send off someone who has got a smaller load 180 to 200 pounds to be a diversion to be able to run the larger load through there cost of doing business well if one spends a few hours down on the border at night and listens and perhaps would have infrared night vision of some kind that they could watch actually watch the people they would come to the conclusion that it isnt the folks that are coming into the united states that want to simply get a job working on farms or whatever it is they do to improve their lives just they are coming here for a better life actually the position that has been taken by the administration we cannot stop people that want to come into the united states for a better life it is too powerful a force we have to let them come in and legitimize them by giving them some kind of identification but i would submit that we can stop people from coming into the united states for a job for a better life we must be able to stop people from doing that because the force that drives them isnt nearly as powerful as the force that drives people to bring illegal drugs into the united states so i am going to say we can stop lettuce pickers and people that want to work on farms and factories in plants we must do that because if we cant do that we dont have a hope of being able to stop the illegal drug smugglers that are coming into the united states so when they come through in a semi which is more rare now or smuggle through in a straight truck when there has been a diversion or maybe a pickup load gets through with the marijuana load under the bed when that all happens large quantities of illegal drugs come into the united states but that is not the only way they come in they also come in on the backs of burros individuals who are sneaking into the united states with 50 pounds of marijuana on their back they might back 15 miles or further to get to the united states border to walk across the unitedstates desert and then get across that border as ice described while i saw there and walk across the united states and walk another 20 25 miles and be picked up along the highway somewhere they toss their marijuana into the truck some get into the truck and go on and stay in the united states some return back to mexico and get another load some turn around and walk back all the way across the desert to get another load that is the kind of thing that is going on with that kind of force on the border with that kind of push a push of 4 million people a year coming across that border intercepting 1 188 000 of them 65 billion worth of illegal drugs 90 percent of the illegal drugs in america coming across that border that includes the marijuana the cocaine the heroin and the methamphetamine which is a big big problem we have shut down the meth labs essentially in iowa that just meant that it used to be 85 percent of the meth came from mexico and iowa now it is much closer to 95 or more percent of the methamphetamine comes from mexico because we shot down the meth labs in iowa zi 2230 but these burreros will haul 50 pounds of marijuana each and they will come in groups of say 8 to 10 10 to 12 up to 50 in fact there is a pack train of them that went up to 100 each with marijuana on their back roughly 50 pounds carrying that across the desert and they drop litter all over the desert and invade our natural areas in fact here i have here on this stand a picture of a natural area and it is quite interesting this is a picture of one of four locations where the longnosed bat an endangered species inhabits a nest and this is on the cabeza prieta national wildlife refuge in arizona i have met with the national park service director and this location is the location where this bat cave as you see was invaded by illegals this was one of their stopoff pointst they could get in there and get cool and rest up a little bit for their trek across the desert so as they came into this bat cave they chased out something like 1 600 bats that lived in there and the bats left we dont know where they went to nest necessarily at least i dont but for 2 years there wasnt a bat in this cave so now we are down to three locations where these rare longnosed bats can live and reproduce so the national park service looked at this and said boy we really dont like to build fences around in our refuge but what are our alternatives if we want to save the bats so they followed a path that seemed to work and that is put this wrought iron fence around here that has spikes that lean out it is about a 75 000 project they built a fence around the bat cave and when they did that the illegals did not come into the cave any longer and the bats came back the bats have been in there reproducing ever since in roughly the same numbers they were before their cave was taken over by the continual flow of illegals that are coming across our natural refuge so i would argue to those that say a fence doesnt work here is a perfect example of how a fence worked at least it kept them out of the cave and now we have a species of bat that is going to be more healthy than they would have been otherwise this is just an interesting little thing that i did i have said that the people that vote for amnesty will be branded with a scarlet letter a for amnesty so by ajo arizona there is a big letter a up there on the mountainside i took a picture of that we colored it up so it is scarlet that is the scarlet letter a that is the brand we dont need amnesty that is why it has a bar across it we need to have the rule of law we need to respect the rule of law that is part of america this is the fence and concrete wall that i designed you can see this portion here this will be slipform footing that goes down perhaps 5 feet and it would be 5 feet and you form a slot in there and you can put a trencher in and put this slip form in and pull it all in one motion and pour concrete as you go trench and pour concrete so this gray portion becomes the footing and you can see where the white portion drops down and that is the slot these are precast concrete panels and they would be about 13v2 feet long they drop down into this slot i think that says 15 inches perhaps 18 but we end up with a constructed height of 12 feet high these precast panels weigh about 9 800 pounds they come in on trucks you pick them up with a crane you drop them in that slot you can just pop them in one after the other just as easily as i have demonstrated on this floor how that can be done once they are put together you can put a little wire on top that wire is a disincentive for people from climbing over the top you can put sensors on there vibration sensors we can put night vision on there we can do all kinds of things to make sure that this wall is not breached walls make sense fences make sense the bat cave is safe from the illegals we can make america safe from the illegals by simply spending some of this hardearned cash the 8 billion being spent to fund our border patrol on the southern border we can make a onetime capital investment it is about 4 million a mile now being spent to control our border and we get about 25 percent efficiency if we would spend about 2 million a mile all the way through those 2 000 miles we would end up with a far higher percentage of efficiency i beliee that number would go over 95 percent if we patrol the border if we put the sensors on surely a fence isnt the only solution but it is a great big wonderful effective tool for our border patrol they could finally aspire to get operational control of the border then there needs to be a solution for the locations where water is going to run across through the gullies we have these solutions in place in many of those locations already these are hbeams that are driven in steel beams that are staggered and welded together here on top with a horizontal beam so they cant be spread apart this lets the water through it will collect the trash and over time you have to clean the trash up but no one can go through there except some wildlife can get through and it does work it is a little more expensive but we will have to do that where the water runs there are engineering solutions to everything we might want to do this is an example of what is happening to our national parks i am not certain whether this is in oregon pipe cactus national monument or in the cabeza prieta but it doesnt matter this is federally preserved land this is precious natural resources that we want americans to have access to look at what we have graffiti painted on the stones graffiti that probably will take years and years and years to ever weather away if it does at all something that is really very difficult to clean up when the paint goes into the pores of the stone down here is just a small example of the kind of litter that we are finding in our national parks some of that litter it is estimated that an average illegal will drop about 8 pounds of litter as they cross the desert eight pounds times 4 million people is a tremendous cleanup problem and it threatens our natural resources it threatens the wildlife in fact about onethird of oregon pipe cactus national monument is now off limits to the public because the concentration of illegals is so intense that the park officers fear for the safety of american tourists in our own national parks because they are threatened and that would be the oregon pipe cactus monument where there officer kris eggle was killed in a shootout with drug smugglers coming across the border i have been to that location there is a memorial that is there in his memory and the memory of the other officers who have given their lives for security i am committed to security for this border so today we passed 700 miles of fence off the floor of this congress this is the third time we havehad a good fence vote here on the floor by my recollection the senate has had two good fence votes over there they are going to get another one they are going to get this bill i am happy to call it the king bill thanks to peter king from new york they are going to get a bill over there and my advice is to the unitedstates senate chew on that awhile i expect the voters will chew on you awhile we are going to take this message to the american people and say let us continue with this message on enforcement fences work there is proof positive that they do no one says where we have built them that we should tear them down they are essential tools they are a capital investment they are a onetime investment and yes we have to patrol and yes we have to maintain them but we get a great return on that capital investment that means it doesnt take as many border patrol officers to secure this border it means that they can be deployed to places where they can be more effective it means that the 4 million people that are coming across our border and the 65 billion worth of drugs will have to find a way to try to sneak through a port of entry which many will try to do and we can beef those up and put more resources there or they will go around the ocean and get out there where the coast guard can do their job and the coast guard has interdiction abilities that supersede those or i will say they are superior to the border patrol so i am ready to force all traffic through the ports of entry i think we must do that i call upon the united states senate to pass the legislation that we passed on the floor here today august 22 2005 i said build a fence build a wall build a barrier 114 days later this congress passed that legislation as part of a larger bill and i have watched as perhaps the most liberal member of the united states senate voted to authorize a fence and voted to fund a fence this extreme notion that comes from a conservative member of congress is mainstream the white house recognizes we need physical barriers to assist and that we need to have enforcement at the border we will have that we will get that done and we are moving quickly it wont all be done by novembdr 7 but a lot of the pieces will be put in place by this republican congress and i am proud to serve with you all and i am looking forward to being part of this solution i am looking forward to going down and setting some posts myself"],

items that cost money they were going to submit themselves to the socalled paygo rules paygo rules are exactly what it sounds like you pay as you go i find it ironic that there is this great pressure to move this amendment now before they do come into the majority because the alternative minimum tax provisions of this amendment have no paygo requirement what in fact they have is spend without covering the costs and so i understand the urgency to get this done right now so that they dont have to follow the commitment that they have made boy is that typical in terms of the railroad bonds i will repeat in a personal conversation with the democratic leader of the senate he asked me to make sure not withstanding previous support and structure that we were dealing with in this extremely fragile measure being carried in an unusual way to make sure that we can send it to the president notwithstanding whether you believe the railroad bond provision has merit or doesnt have merit it cannot be added at this time or you will lose the measure i personally will put my trust in the judgment of the democratic leader of the senate finally on ocs as i said to the gentleman from massachusetts in another time in another place in another circumstance for largely the same reason that i mentioned we have to correct this i appreciate it has been going on for 10 years we do

are very fragile trying to hold ourselves together notwithstanding the merits of this please dont put it on this measure time place manner it is 10 years overdue can we make it 10 years and 20 days overdue so that you dont destroy all of the stuff that is in this bill so that we can get this done and then we turn the floor over to you in the first 100 hours i am sure this would be number 1 2 or 3 based upon the outrage that i think you justifiably present on this particular issue for all those reasons unwillingness to follow their own rules they say they are going to follow on paygo for an

has been shifting from the legislative branch of government to the executive branch we all know this to be true it should come as no surprise that this president or the prior one want this expanded power the real surprise would be if this congress finally stood up and said no we all know that the president today has the ability to veto any bill congress passes and we all know he has not done so
