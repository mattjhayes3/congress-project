long before he came to join us here in the congress as one member who is associated with the congimssional black caucus alternative i want to say i was very struck in observing the debate yesterday how much the caucus substitute affected members on the other side of aisle my colleague from new york and a leader of the administrations budget forces mr kemf in particular said a number of favorable things about the caucus budget yesterday andi i want to congratulate him on his remarks i recall that my colleague from new york did take issue with the overall tax revenue proposale in the caucur budget while at the same time congratulating the caucus in proposing the indexing of the tax code to inflatiotn and the 10percent nonrefundable social security tax credit it is good to know that at least one person on the other side of the aisle thinks the opposition is capable of having positive ideas on how to solve the economys problems yet my col3eague did say the following in opposition to our budget proposal i just wish my friends in the caucus had not seen fit to raise taxes so heavily on everyone else in the country and introduce so many zerosum tradeoffs by pitting one class of taxpayer against another what we need is more equity for all americans and less pitting classes of people against each other if this is the case then my colleague from new york should join in support of the congressional black caucus substitute after all as the dsg fact sheet on the budget says the caucus substitute offers the largest anld fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house i wish to ask my colleague from new york who is responsible for pitting classes of people against each other the cbc or the reagan administration who is calling for more tax equity and reform of a tax code that everyone knows presently is grossly inequitablethe cbc or the reagan administration who is demanding basic cuts or eliminations of domestic human resource programs the result of which will be even greater poverty than exists today and even greater unemploymentthe cbc or the reagan administration i would like my colleague from new york to answer these questions i would add a personal observation is there any one in this body who really thinks the reagan administration lattagramm budget is contributing to national unity and social consensus i would like to hear it frankly the greatest tragedy of the administrations budget plan is that it may become the single biggest factor of divisiveness and social unrest in the nation that has occurred in many years the presidents proposals in the areas of national defense and taxation 111887 will contribu~te the most to disunity in tive they need to boost productivity the nation and production it did not go unnoticed yesterday

more than onethird of call the caucus tax budget the largest the total direct outlays for fiscal year and fairest tax cuts of any of the pro1982 projected either by the house posals before the house

interest tax to become i predict a major area of research group this proposal gives domestic conflict and economic weakbusinesses the kind of economic incen ness in the coming years i am not alone in warning of this economists as diverse as henry kaufmanwho is often called the sage of wall street and a republican i might adddr wassily leontieff the nobel prizewinning economist and authority on economic structures at new york university and dr lester thurow of mit in the last few months have all voiced the strongest doubts about the economic viability and desirability of the reagan administrations defense program i notice yesterday as reported in the washington post today the mormon church and its leaders ii a very rare comment on national policies came out in opposition to the mx missile system their statement of opposition it should be noticed by my colleagues went far beyond the mx missile the mormon church leadership squarely attacked the basic assumptions behind the unitedstates military establishment the soviet military establishment and the frightening global arms race that both superpowers equally are contributing toward referring to the terrifying arms race that~ has to be halted spencer w kimball president of the mormon church stated we deplore in particular the building of vast arsenals of nuclear weaponry history indicates that men have seldon created armaments that eventually were not put to use 0 with the most serious concern over the pressing moral question of possible nuclear conflict we plead with our national leaders to marshal the genius of the nation to find viable alternatives the mormon church leadership is referring to the deadly world arms race that is draining nations of their resources and revenues that otherwise would be spent on economic and social develolimentspecifically which last year exceeded 500 billion dollars and which the reagan administration in its budget proposal is contributing mightily toward i believe there is a growing sense in this body that the defense budget will undo~whatever good might resultfrom administration economic policies and i say this as one who is highly skeptical about the administrations policies if the congresssional black caulcus and a handful of socalled house liberals alone had challenged the reagan defense budget it likely would have been dismissed summarily but the caucus is not alone in its criticism of the transfer of some 50 billion in additional budget authority to dod next year we are joined by leading churches in the land by highly respectable economists and financial leaders the simple truth is that the defense budget that the administration is proposing will intensify inflation because inflationary costs in the defense sector have been running at twice the rate as in the economy overall intensify inflation because of the widely acknowledged shortages of pro may 6 1981 duction in the defense sector and in the shortages of its labor force intensify inflation because of the widely reported monopolistic practice among defense contractors the lack of competitive contract bidding at dod and the widespread lack of pentagon control over its own budget intensify inflation because in the aggregate boosts in defense spending add income but not consumer goods and services and therefore add to the class inflation of too many dollars chasing too few goods and shift badly needed investment capital away from the civilian sectors of the economy that are mnost in need of revitalization i detect among my colleagues especially on the opposite side of the aisle a growing uneasiness about the administrations and the latta0ramms defense budget that uneasiness is understandable no one has come up with a convincing argument why an additional 50 billion in defense is needed other than the ageold shibboleths about national security and the russians are coming this morning i went over some comparative figures on the relative strengths of the unitedstates defense establishment and the soviets in termsa of defense spending during the last 10 years the nato allies have outspent the warsaw pact by 207 billion according to londons international institute for strategic studies in terms of strategic nuclear warheads the best measure of relative numerical strengths the united states has 9 200 warheads as compared to 7 000 on the soviet side of equal importance the united states has far greater command control flexibility and survivability in relation to its ability to fight a nuclear war than has the soviet union for example only 25 percent of our strategic warheads are land basedand relatively vulnerableas compared to 80 percent of the soviets warheads and because of our triad of strategic forceslandbased seabased and airbasedthe united states has a wide advantage over the soviets for example 48 percent of our strategic warheads are either at sea alert or in bombers on alert as compared to 3 percent of the soviets warheads there is a shocking orthodoxy in this chamber about the need for a stronger defense establishment despite the facts and figures despite the questionability of ever winning a nuclear war however limited or of needing any more nuclear arms than we presently have as the mormon church leaders observed my col leagues especially on the other side of the aisle still cling to the panacea of more defense spending as if it were a reflex action that arises when no other solutions to our economys problems and the worlds problems are in sight i think we ought to debate many more hours the role of defense spending in the administrations budget and in relation to economic recovery we ought to debate many more hours the assumptions behind the reagan lattagramm budget and the alternative that the congressional black caucus is proposing i would now like to touch briefly upon a matter which in terms of dollars may be considered relatively insignificant in relation to the overall federal budget however it is a very important matter because of its direct bearing upon the quality of justice in this country i speak of the legal services corporation when the congress enacted the legislation establishing the legal services corporation in 1974 it made findings about the need for such a program the congress specifically found that first there is a need in this country for equal access to our system of justice second there is a need to provide highquality legal assistance to those who are unable to afford it third providing legal assistance to those facing an economic barrier to obtaining legal help serves the ends of justice fourth the availability of legal assistance has reaffirmed for many people their faith in our government of laws pifth a legal services program should be kept free of the influence of political pressures and sixth attorneys who provide legal assistance under such a program must have full freedom to protect the best interests of their clients just as other members of the bar have full freedom to protect their clients interests those findings are as valid and accurate today as they were in 1974 and the need for a legal services corporation today is as great as it was in 1974 continued funding of the corporation is essential if we are to keep this countrys commitment to equal justice under the law the need for the continuation of the legal services corporation has been widely recognized in addition to numerous individual private attorneys district attorneys judges state attorneys general and state governors many national organizations have called for continued funding of the corporation including the american bar association the american association of retired persons national association of retired teachers the aflcio the american coalition of citizens with disabilities the childrens defense fund the friends committee on national legislation the league of united latin american citizens lulac the lead ership conference on civil rights the national bar association the national council of churches the national council of senior citizens the national committee against discrimination in housing the national mental health association the national farmers union the national council on aging the national urban league the national legal aid and defender association the united states conference of mayors the united states catholic conference and rural america one of the announced goals of this administration is a reduction in what it refers to as unnecessary and inefficient federal regulations continuation of the legal services corporation will not frustrate that goal the legal services corporation does not engage in any substantive regulation and it is not a part of the federal bureaucracy in addition the corporations programs are locally controlled the corporation has been soundly managed and its programs have been costeffectiveit expends only 1 8 percent of its funds on management and administration and another 1 8 percent for field monitoring and evaluation continuation of the legal services corporation has bipartisan support just last monday the judiciary committees subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice unanimously reported an authorization bill for the corporation that bill authorizes 200 million for the corporation for each of the next 2 fiscal years in addition the bill addresses some of the criticisms that have been leveled at the corporation such as in the area of class action suits and lobb ying i urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to continue the important work of the legal services corporation"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "so i am asking if there is any compassion left in this rather bizarre exercise that we have been through during the last

are talking about a 53 3 billion increase in the military budget this year we are talking about almost doubling it in the year 1986 to shock the members in a different way in the decade of the 1970s this country and many of us served in the house during the seventies we spent 1 trillion on the military function in the first 5 years of the 1980s we are anticipating spending between 1 3 to 1 5 trillion with cost overruns and what have you it is conceivable in the first 5 years of the 1980s our military budget expenditure could exceed 2 trillion if we project that out to the year 1990 it is clear by most con~servative figures that this country will be spending between 2v2 trillion and maybe 2 7 trillion or 2 8 trillion so in a 10year period we are talking about more than doubling close to tripling the military budget now the qu tion that the average citizen in this country ought to be asking is how do you finance this large substantial sustained increase~ in the military budget members of the committee there are really only three ways you can do it either you go to the american people and you say that the nature of the world is so frighten ing so dangerous so unstable that we must now askthie american people for new taxes in order to finance this incredible burden but not one politician in this body the other body or down at the other end of pennsylvania avenue is actually advocating levying new taxes to finance this increase so let us throw that out as an option the second alternative is to engage in substantial budg6t deficit spending but this administration has trapped itself in the rhetoric of the balanced budget it cannot insult my intellect nor the intellect of the american people by suggesting that a democratlc party budget deficit is inflationary and a republican party deficit is not inflationary we know that is absurd so to engage in deficit sepending is a travesty they have t6 show by the next election that they had moved toward a balanced budget or they have lost credibility so they cannot engage in deficit spending for any substantial period of time to finance this incredible increase in this military budget to 367 lbillion by fiscal year 1986 so what is the third alternative the third alternative is to reach into the nonmilitary side of the budget and engage in substantial cuts in order to finance this incredible increase in the military budget and that is the assertion that i make on the floor this afternoon this administration suggested a budget authority cut of 48 4 billion on the nonmilitary side and led the american people to believe that we are reducing federal expenditures a couple of weeks later you make a budget schedule that increases the military budget by 53 3 billion that has to be a wash the argument that i assert aggressively is that these budget cuts are not designed to fight inflation our own congressional budget office indicated that cutting 2 5 billion from the budget would only reduce the inflation rate by between 0 1 and 0 2 of 1 percent so what is this all about it is about financing an increase in the military budget which becomes the least politically risky and the safest way to do it because levying taxes has political implications engaging in continued budget deficits has political implications but ripping off the poor ripping off workingclass people ripping off senior citizens ripping off the children and middleincome citizens of america is becoming the safest way to engage in financing military budgets the american people need to desperately understand that is what this is all about so the question then becomes is there a rationale for the expenditures and for this incredible amount of money i do not believe so and later in this debate we will be making a significant argument that challenges the assumptions of those who perceive the prob lems of the world as being military problems that can be solved in a military fashion there are those of us in this body who frankly and legitimately believe that the problem of the 1980s bring new imperatives call for new policies there are 160 nations in the world many of them eager for freedom and to simplylook through the narrow confines of the parochial prism of united statessoviet ideological relations is an absurdity we have to begin to look at the economic social and political realities of human mnisery in the world and that does not dictate this incredible expenditure of the military budget to rip off millions of human beings who have a right in a free and open democratic society to believe that their government would not abandon them should not be the people upon whose back we build an incredible military machine there have been a number of economists who have pointed out that there are really only two ramifications for going down this road either we bankrupt this nation by moving more and more of its resources into a smaller and smaller segment of economy and the bottom drops out

know that two members of the irish free state army who during the transition time were working more or less with the black and tans to enforce the partition had come to the house earlier looking for me so i went to bed and about 1 30 in came these two guys and one of them stuck a revolver in my mouth and told me now you be brave and things will go easy this may sound funny to you but i heard a voice speaking to me it said knock the gun out of his hand and run so i knocked the gun out of his hand and ran but the other guy opened fire i got one bulhet through here a scar still shows on the bixck of osullivans neck and out my jaw aother one hit my tie and two more passed through my coat osullian still cannot hide his emotion as he remembers meeting his parents the next day who had known to find him at the house of sone cousins his mother knelt the entire night through from 1 30 until 7 when she got up from her knees and said joes been shot but hes not dead while recovering at the infirmary osullivan got a tip that the free staters were coming for him again so with seven pounds given him by his father and without a pass to explain his departure he left for england and worked a year as a carpenter with his brother neither of them paying income tax in protest of the british government before getting a passport to come to this country where an osullivan brother was already living in san francisco soon after arriving here the osullivan brothers joined the carpenla local 22 and found that their proffketncy in the trade landed them plenty of work then the 1926 carpenters strfie began which was the third attempt to break the postworld war i buildingboonitriggered american plan which resulted in workers wages being cut by as much as 71 percent the three osullivan brothers with two other irish workers and a french driver formed a wrecking crew sabotaging work sites where scab labor was employing beating up the workers and destroying tools not a savory job but

through the 1926 strike he ran again in four months this time winning the office later osullivans local would strike for and win health and welfare benefits the pension program and the dental plan when world war ii began carpenters were needed to work round the clock in shipyards and housing projects osullivan supplied the needed thousand workers by negotiating with the homebuilders association who had until then refused any cooperation with the local osullivan enlisted serving as navy chief in the seabees for three years when the war ended he was asked to resume office with the local in 1947 he was elected president of the carpenters district councl and later president of the san francisco building and trades construction council an amendment was passed in 1975 prohib iting union members over 70 years of age from seeking office osullivan who was then 73 believes he was the pnion member the officials had in mind id been bucking piecework shoddy workmanship greasing of nails using one nail where two are requiredand of course i dont think the higherups liked it too well osullivan took legal action but the courts upheld the statute then members of his local organized a petition drive for a dispensation from the unions president general that too failed at the time the san francisco city strike was underway and osullivan representing the building and construction trades council as chairman of the negotiating committee had been found in contempt of court and sentenced with live others to fe days in jail and a 500 fine when osullivan retired in 1977 the union gave a dinntr in his honor t the hilton hotel the facility which holds 2 000 was filled to capacity after all the bills were paid osullivan donated the 28 000 in proceeds to charity since his

memory to recall his vision for america and to remind my colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure

delegate from the district of columbia for bringing forward a constructive alternative to this budget io the jones proposal and lest we forget there are other alternatives that have been proposed and yet we have heard very little mention of the congressional black caucus constructive alternative mr fauntroy the chairman of the congressional black caucus has already pointed out to you that we offer the only budget that is in surphits encourages increased jobs and productivity and relieves the american people of a growing tax burden above all the budget the cbc proposes shares theburden of austerity among the rich as well as the poor and it does so without necessarily cutting back vital social programs i note as an additional recomnmendation the analysis of the democratic study group which says that this budget takes the boldest step of any proposals being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit as to the cbc tax proposalwhich many have said provides no tax relief at allthe dsg report says that it offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any proposal before the house this is indreed a strong recommendation since this is accomplished while at the same time providing for increased defense spending and for those vital programs from energy conservation to community development to income security programs which the administration proposals would sacrifice but without which the communities we represent would not survive i want to draw your attention in particular to the functions of the cbc budget that deal with energy one of the most critical considerations of the nation as a whole and one that most seriously affects the poor of this nation it seems to me that this is one aspect of the social safety network which the administration purports to preserve and guarantee but which has been grievously overlooked the reagan administrations energy budget proposals are a complete reorientation of the federal gloverniments role in energy programs as described by the house budget committees summary and analysis the reagan budget would suggest a near total dependence on market forces for making societal transitions from an inexpensiveenergy past to a very expensiveenergy future this approach leaves unanswered two important questions to what extent must market forces be supplemented to bring about the development of new energy supplies and conservation techniques and to what extent should the federal government assist citizenisparticularly those with low incomeswith conservation and weatherization to adapt to higher energy costs th6 contradictions become clear the administration exalts virtues of unconstrained market forces and yet it was under the free play of market forces in the past that the nation became vulnerable to the oil threat of opec nationswith its derivative adverse effects it was the free play of market forces that made it possible for only those large and rich firms with easy access to capital to develop alternative energy technologies and suppliesclosing off the field to innovative and competitive small businesses and in fact the budgets endorsed by the administration clearly favor big business at the expense of smalleven though there are not necessarily economies of scale and it is small business that will generate the most employment above all under the free play of market forces families with low incomes had no recoursethrough conservation and weatherization assistance to adapt to higher energy costs which were thrust upon them these are flagrant contradictions to what the administration budget purports to do to its allegation that it is preserving the safety net that it is minding the best interests of the nation most flagrant of these contra dictions while the poor are sacrificed to untrammeled market forces special interest groups would preserve their agriculturalsubsidies addressing these concerns the congressional black caucus budget proposal focuses on alternate energy development and conservation it specifically restores funds to the energy areas which would encourage the development and research for alternate fuel sources thereby lessening our dependence on opec oil the crc budget goes forward with a program of energy conservation which is both practical and humane and allows for protection against the elements for those who can least afford to fend off the ravages of winter where the reagan budget would remove the lowincome weatherization program from the department of energy and drop it into a community development block grant somewhere in hud which is funded at a 466 million reduced budget authority the cbc restores full funding for this program and where the reagan budget would eliminate more than half of the funding of the economic regulatory administration the congressional black caucus budget restores funding to this agency to allow it to collect the 3 billion in petroleum overcharges which would go uncollected under the reagan budget by item the cbc budget restores 0 7 billion in budget authority and 0 4 billion in outlays in fiscal year 1982 for energy conservation cbc restores 0 1 billion in budget authority and 0 1 billion in outlays in cuts to the solar bank which would allow for loan supplements for solar residential use primarily cbc would restore 0 7 billion in budget authority and 0 8 billion in outlays to the nonfossil energy supply such as geothermal energy impact assistance environmental and hydro power programs it must be remembered that the cbc energy budget is reduced even greater than the reagan proposed budget some of the major reductions which cbc made to the reagan proposal were of 0 3 billion in budget authority by delaying the gaseous centrifuge uranium enrichment plant crcs budget calls for doe charging fair value prices for uranium enrichment thereby saving 0 2 billion in budget authority and 0 2 billion in outlays the cbc budget further identified 1 5 billion saved in budget authority and 1 5 billion in outlays by reducing the strategic petroleum reserve funding and allowing for private funding in an instance when it is far more valid finally cancellation of the clinch river breeder reactor is a budgetary salvation of 0 3 billion in outlays the congressional black caucus total energy budget equals 5 4 billion in budget authority and 6 0

these concerns may often be a real matter of life and death such as in the weatherization and low income fuel assistance programs which cbc would fund fully the cbc would speak for those people who

failed in fact i got only four votes later the house adopted the administrations budgetthe grammlatta substitute the administrations budget was based on the radical supplyside theory that you do not have to balance the budget it was based on the theory that an enormous gap between what you spend and what you take in in revenue will somehow send a positive signal to wall street during the budget committeep markup last year my good friend the gentleman from new york who is the architect of the administrations tax cut made a statement that i found shocking and almost incredible at the time however events have proved the accuracy of mr kemps remarks on april 7 1981 the gentleman from new york representative kemp the coauthor of the presidents tax program had this to say about the philosophy underlying the administrations program balanced budget i used to think that i do admit to that whats radical about reagans economics and stockinans economics and republican economics today i we dont any longer worship at the shrine of the balanced budget well mr kemp may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget mr stockman may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget mr reagan may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget and republicans in general may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget but millions of americans do millions of americansincluding a good number of folks in the the financial marketscontinue to believe that the federal government should balance its own accounts so that it spends no more than it takes in i find myself now in a very difficult situation it is hard to know what is the fiscally sound course to take i voted to report the budget committees recommendation because i believed we needed a vehicle to bring this debate to the floor and that was the fairest and soundest proposal i had seen until that point but we are now in the middle of a debate in which achieving a deficit of 110 billion is considered a great victory for fiscal responsibility last friday the republican senate passed a budget with a deficit of 116 billion the republican alternative that we have before us has a deficit of 110 billion according to the most recent cbo analysis this is the budgdt that president reagan endorses i never thought i would have lived to see the headline republican president endorses 110 billion deficiti how things have changed how did we get to this point where a 110 billion deficit is hailed as a great victory we all know the answer to this question the answerin one wordis reaganomics reaganomics has produced a 1983 projected deficit of 182 billion compared to a reaganomics deficit of 182 billion 116 billion looks good but only in comparison to the outrageous result imposed upon us by reaganomics last year the administration told us we needed a massive military buildup they said we needed to spend 1 5 trillion on the military over 5 years along with this massive increase in military spending they said we needed an enormous tax cut to be more specific they said that the wealthy and big corporations needed a big tax cut the message was the ntion needs this big military buildup but we do not have to pay for it in fact we need to make major cuts in our revenues this illogical combination of spending increases and tax cuts was somehow supposed to instill confidence in the financial markets this has not happened what has happened was what was predictable all along the financial markets saw that reaganomics produces increasing deficits and so they kept interest rates high and stifled recovery in addition to a 182 billion deficit reaganomics has also given us the worst recession since world war ii last month unemployment reached 9 4 percent 10 3 million americans are out of work industries like liousing and autos are in a neardepression state i only wish that this administration would give a greater sign that it is finally realizing what its policies have produced reaganomics has given a tax reduction all right jobless people do not pay taxes this is now day 490 of the reagan administration fourhundred and ninety days ago a president was inaugurated who the american people believed would balance the budget in day 490 of the reagan administration we are further away from a balanced budget than we have ever been in the history of our nation i am running for attorneygeneral of texas i will not be around to remind the administration of its promise to balance the budget i hope that you who remain will do this for me the time has come to reject this folly called reaganomics the time has come to reject the foolish and dangerous idea that we can have a massive increase in military spending without paying for it if we truly need it we shoidd be willing to pay for it the time has come for our republican colleagues to join with us democrats to restore a sound fiscal policy to this nation we need to work together to fashion a budget that is fair to all americans and that is based on accepted standards of fiscal responsibility the latta budget is untair and irresponsible it hurts the elderly it denies educational opportunity to mil lions of americnns and it is a back door attempt to cut social security benefits we cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of a year ago defeat the latta budget"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9719142913818359,

arrangement which would put this house on record as favoring a recomputation of the basis for determining parity in the payments to social security recipients in such a way as to predetermine that we would reduce benefits to those social security recipients by some 8 billion a year that i am advised is the sole purpose and intent of the provision adopted in the other body it purports to achieve equity by changing the formula so that social security recipients no longer would be allowed to receive benefits based upon increases in the cost of living but would be required to receive benefits based either upon increases in the cost of living or increases in average wages and salaries whichever were the lesser those who have come to this conclusion that it will save 8 billion quite obviously intend that in the coming fiscal year wages and salaries shall lag far behind increases in prices upon that nefarious proposition they base their expectation of saving some 8 billion at the
