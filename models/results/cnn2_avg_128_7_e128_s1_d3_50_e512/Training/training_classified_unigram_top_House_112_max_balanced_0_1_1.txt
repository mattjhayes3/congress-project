{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "1 year after the deepwater horizon oil spill americans are paying record gas prices in northern virginia gas that used to cost 3 per gallon now costs more than 4 per gallon this gas price hike is a result of instability in the middle east and possible oil speculation and is a reminder of our dangerous dependence on foreign oil sadly our republican colleagues are not advancing legislation to help our hardpressed consumers their plan would line the pockets of big oil which saw its profits skyrocket 30 percent in line with rising gas prices fortunately there are positive steps we can take to promote energy independence in america and to protect consumers improve vehicle efficiency boost production of domestic renewable energy and convert oil industry tax breaks into gas price relief for our consumers america owns 1 5 percent of the worlds oil but consumes 22 5 percent so we cant drill our way to energy independence the only way to end our dependence on foreign oil and reduce gas prices is by improving automobile efficiency and developing new sources of clean domestic energy energy independence is going to depend on reducing our oil consumption and shifting to domestic forms of energy like wind solar biofuels and gas energy independence will save consumers money and protect us from the instability of the middle east at the end of 2010 congress extended tax credits for biofuels and the production of wind and solar energy these tax credits increased wind energy production by nearly 43 percent in just 2 years so extending them is an important step to increasing the supply of domestic energy under the authority of the clean air act president obama and automakers recently announced an agreement to improve the efficiency of automobiles by 30 percent by 2016 this agreement will save consumers 3 000 for each car purchased 5 years from now here is another way of looking at it if you could save 30 percent at the pump better vehicle efficiency would more than offset the recent spike in gas prices unfortunately oil companies and their allies here in congress are trying to roll back much of this progress republican speaker boehner forced through legislation which would repeal much of the clean air act hurting american consumers and undermining our national security last week the leadership in the house passed legislation to shortcircuit safety rules for oil production off americas coasts increasing the likelihood of another deepwater horizon catastrophe their legislation would also allow oil exploration that would impede naval operations off the chesapeake bay in virginia this week they want to attempt to pass a bill allowing for more oil drilling even if it interferes with military bases or endangers coastal economies i do not support reckless efforts to allow unregulated oil drilling which endangers coastal economies and national security last week i introduced amendments to these oil drilling bills one would strike the antisafety language and add a provision to repeal 37 billion in oil company tax loopholes the amendment would remit this money to american drivers averaged among licensed drivers my amendment would give 185 to every licensed driver in america reducing the equivalent price of gasoline by 27 cents a gallon the other amendment was written to protect national security it simply requires that the commander in chief in consultation with the secretary of defense certify that before we drill for oil off the coast of virginia that it does not hamper national security and naval operations i was shocked that all but a handful of republicans voted to kill this commonsense amendment since the leadership has blocked efforts to include real gas price relief in their oil drilling bills i am introducing standalone legislation to assist consumers the bill entitled the gas price relief act would terminate tax loopholes for oil companies while rebating the savings to our hardpressed commuters throughout america there are many positive steps we can take to reduce our de pendence on foreign oil steps that will include clean energy renewable energy and

explosion ripped through the 2mile area of the upper big branch mine in montcoal west virginia the explosion bent railroad tracks like pretzels and killed 29 miners this disaster laid bare the loopholes that riddle our mine safety laws these loopholes allowed dubious mine operators like massey energy to violate mine safety rules repeatedly and with impunity in fact the upper big branch mine was allowed to remain open even though it had been ordered to stop operations 51 times in the previous year because of severe safety hazards after the disaster there were proclamations made from both sides of the aisle about taking meaningful action to honor the victims so that something like this would never happen again however standing here a year later miners still face many of the same dangers as they did the morning before the tragedy in west virginia unscrupulous mine operators are still gaming the system by clogging it with thousands of appeals as a way to avoid paying strong penalties miners are still paralyzed with the fear of being fired for speaking out because of weak whistleblower protections decisions made in the boardrooms to maximize coal production at the expense of miners safety remain unchallenged management practices of illegally giving advance warning of pending inspections are still a mere misdemeanor shortly after the upper big branch tragedy the education and labor committee held the only hearings where congress heard from families and miners affected by this tragedy many were reluctant to testify because they feared retaliation for others there was a strong desire to tell their stories to prevent another tragedy in the coal mines of america eddie cook told us about the dangerous practices he heard from the miners at the upper big branch mine after the explosion he lost his 21yearold nephew adam morgan adams father steve morgan said that when he spoke to his son about the unsafe conditions management told him that he might just have to find another job they did nothing about the unsafe conditions gary quarles lost his only son at upper big branch gary asked us to make a commitment to make sure that it doesnt happen again alice peters testified about how her soninlaw dean jones was afraid to work in the mine because of the ventilation problems but dean needed the job in order to keep health insurance coverage for his specialneeds son clay mullins lost his brother rex at upper big branch clay testified how the management would give advance warning of an impending mine safety inspection so that they could quickly cover up any violations before the federal inspectors got to that part of the mine and stanley goose stewart was working at the upper big branch mine the day it exploded he testified twice before the committee about the persistent fear and intimidation faced by workers from massey management every mine law has been written with the blood of miners and savvy political interests know that as attention to the tragedy fades so does the willingness of the congress to act decisively families and miners also expressed their concern about this skepticism looking back now a year later their skepticism was entirely justified congress has utterly failed to respond to the real problems that miners themselves have identified as safety hazards in their workplace a toxic political environment has failed these families the paytoplay nature of our politics has failed these families while congressional action was stymied the mine safety and health administration has been working hard to make adjustments in the limited ways it can to help prevent rogue mine operators from recklessly putting lives at risk but even with these measures we are hearing the familiar cries from big coal to maintain the status quo while they continue to game a legal system designed to protect the miners who go to work in those mines every day they cry about their socalled due process but what about the due process for the 29 miners who died in the upper big branch mine explosionand their families what about the miners who went to work today in the coal mines of americaand their families is congress just going to sit here and simply wait for the next explosion the next tragedy the next loss of life are we going to let the special interests continue to paralyze this institution these should not be hard questions for the congress of the united states our ability to respond goes to the heart of who we are as a nation there are things that congress can and must do right nowand that only congress can doto better ensure that every coal miner who goes to work is able to return safely to their families at the end of their shifts congress has an obligation to make sure that that is the case it is long overdue to honor our promises to the families of the 29 miners who perished a year ago for doing the job that our nation relies on to provide its energy and it is also long overdue to give the

to budge an inch i want to cut government spending but i dont want to take the money from children who need early childhood education i dont want to take the money from families that need help paying for colleges and i dont want to take the money from seniors who need medical care i want to cut the gobs and gobs of money nearly 7 billion every single month were spending to occupy a foreign nation and have our servicemen killed and maimed by insurgents you want to eliminate wasteful government spending i say the war in afghanistan could be number one on our list ten years after we started

and nationwide every day 34 people are killed by guns in the hours following the horrific tragedy in colorado we paused to reflect and send our prayers to families grieving an unimaginable loss but now is the time to have a national discussion about how to stem these epidemic levels of gun violence i wish this tragedy in aurora were an isolated incident but it seems to be part of a recurring pattern 19 people were shot and eight were killed in tucson in 2011 29 people were shot and 13 died at fort hood in 2009 21 people were shot and five were killed at northern illinois university in 2008 and 17 people were wounded while 32 people died at virginia tech in 2007 when will we have enough when will we stand up and say we may not be able to stop every crime but we can stop some of them and at least minimize the damage of others the gun lobby doesnt want us to have this conversation first they accuse anyone who tries to spark a national debate about how to mitigate gun violence with exploiting the deaths of innocent people yet no one was accused of exploitation when after hurricane katrina we discussed how to improve femas emergency response or after a deadly salmonella outbreak when we debated how to improve public safety after such national tragedies society should engage in a discussion about how to address and potentially prevent such tragedies from happening again we might not all agree but this is a democracy and this is how public policy is made next the gun lobby seeks to stymie debate by arguing that guns dont kill people people kill people i dont buy this argument i dont buy that theres nothing we can do to stop criminals and the mentally ill from killing if they want to sure we cant stop them with 100 percent certainty but we can make it a lot harder for wouldbe assassins we can ensure every gun is purchased after a background check rather than only 60 percent of guns as is the current case and we can reduce the fatality rate by banning assault rifles and highcapacity magazines that are designed exclusively for killing dozens of people at once finally the gun lobby tries to argue that any attempt to regulate gun access is an attempt to restrict all gun access this is simply not true there is such a thing as commonsense middleground gun reform and most gun owners support it eightyone percent of gun owners support requiring a background check on all firearm purchases yet 40 percent of unitedstates gun sales are conducted by private sellers who are not required to perform background checks these private sellers operate at gun shows where anyone can walk in and buy whatever gun they want convicted felons domestic abusers the severely mentally ill and even people on the terrorist watch list canand dogo into gun shows and buy any gun they want ninety percent of all americans also support strengthening databases to prevent the mentally ill from buying guns but sadly 10 states have still failed to flag a single person as mentally ill in the national background check database and 17 other states have fewer than 100 people listed as mentally ill over 1 million disqualifying mental health records are still missing from the database finally we must have a conversation about getting assault weapons and highcapacity magazines machines designed exclusively for killing people off the streets when you have a 100round clip on your gun you are not protecting your home you are hunting people lets be clear this is not about restricting anyones second amendment rights the supreme court has ruled and made clear the right of americans to own guns but while reaffirming the second amendment the court was careful to note that the amendment is not limitless justice scalia explained in columbia v heller that like most rights the second amendment is not unlimited it is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose can we stop every shooting no but can we reduce their frequency and deadliness absolutely can we do it while still respecting the second amendment of this i am certain but the first step toward keeping dangerous guns out of the hands of dangerous people

legislation will create or save more than 2 million jobs including approximately 9 000 in rhode island by authorizing highway and transit programs through 2014 unfortunately in order to secure an

that they need to develop the human infrastructure that they need todays skills to meet todays competition they will tell you about doing it smarter so as to be that sharpest competitor on the global scene and they will talk about innovation just how does innovation happen its taking ideas and moving them along investing in r d building a prototype developing that impact in manufacturing and

challenges us about not doing the mindless handouts to oil companies were seeing some of the ceos garnering some quarter of a million shares prime shares of stock thats what theyre doing with these payments these handouts to the oil companies when we could invest that in job creation and thats what this make it in america is all about i know when we put those down payments on invention and

community they grow and expand their opportunity i have within the capital region of new york the third fastest growing hub for science and tech jobs and thats happening because of investment from the public sector partnered with private sector investments and it works its a winning formula and i would say that we just need to pursue in that fashion and we can gain tremendously and why would you

members of local governing boards engineers providing technical and comparative analysis and bank tellers to register with the sec as municipal advisers in response to its proposal the sec received over 1 000 comment letters from across the industry that were overwhelmingly critical of the proposed rule this is why i introduced h r 2827 h r 2827 takes important steps to address these widely acknowledged concerns and specifies the scope and limits of doddfranks municipal adviser provisions after introducing our original version of h r 2827 we asked everyone on both sides of the aisleand industry participants as well with a wide variety of perspectivesto give us their comments and suggestions for improving the legislation my colleague and cosponsor from wisconsin and i have spent countless hours working and listening to all concerned parties to ensure that we have fully considered all the viewpoints in order to come up with the best possible legislation that could also pass with broad bipartisan support at this time i certainly want to thank her for all of her efforts there were two concerns about the original version of h r 2827 that were the most significant the first was that the original version of the bill would strike the federal fiduciary duty for municipal advisers leaving in place just the statebased fiduciary duty standards second even when explicitly engaged to provide municipal adviser services the original bill would have excluded certain parties from regulation as municipal advisers during the subcommittee markup ms moore and i articulated our plan for going forward with the legislation and we invited more comments and suggestions from industry and all concerned parties we were very pleased with the genuine engagement of the parties from across the industry and with their willingness to generously share their time experience effort and knowledge with us all of these contributions ultimately produced a better and stronger amended bill we believe that this new version of the bill addresses the points raised since the subcommittee markup while still maintaining our broad coalition of bipartisan supporters this new bill preserves the federal fiduciary standard and removes the blanket status exemptions while still maintaining a brightline municipal adviser definition it protects issuers by establishing clear lines and rules for municipal advisory activity and provides clarity in the marketplace in addition to the amendments substance i am very proud of the process that weve been able to undertake to get us to this point i would like to thank my colleague again ms moore and her staff for working with me and my staff and i thank all of those who worked with us to get us to where we are in this process they were so generous in sharing their time and i am confident that what we have is a good bill with which we can move forward again i urge my colleagues to support h r 2827 with that i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9912919709458947, 0.008708029054105282, 1, "can i finish the acting chair members will suspend the gentleman from florida controls the time to whom does he yield"], [0.9909054068848491,

outstanding leadership as has been said many times but cannot be emphasized enough this committee prides itself on being bipartisan and mr mckeon and his staff have more than upheld that tradition we appreciate that we have worked together on a large number of issues also worked together with members of the congress not just on the committee as we have seen with many of the amendments processed we have been able to include the ideas from a great many members both republican and democrat from across this house and i feel we have produced an outstanding product as a result i also want to take a moment to recognize this is the last markup or last house defense bill we will be sending with secretary gates as our secretary of defense and i want to honor him for his service he has served seven maybe eight presidents both republicans and democrats has done an outstanding job for this country in all of those roles and in particular as secretary of defense for the last 5 years his leadership has been outstanding for this country i will also note that he is retiring to the state of washington so that too shows great judgment on his part we appreciate its been great working with him he will be missed we are excited to start working with the new secretary of defense mr panetta as soon as he gets confirmed and moves into that role so i thank the chairman and i guess i want to conclude by thanking my staff this is my first time as the ranking member on this committee it is a great honor that the caucus gave me and i absolutely could not have gotten it done without the help of the staff that we have on the armed services committee both minority and majority for that matter so i thank them for their help and their assistance i urge support for the bill and i again thank the chairman
