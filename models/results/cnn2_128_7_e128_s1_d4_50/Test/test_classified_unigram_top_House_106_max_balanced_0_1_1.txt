that are extremely important to the education of our children and because it hurts displaced workers i urge my colleagues to oppose it the first problem with this gop bill is that it severely shortchanges education by 3 5 billion this bill would end our commitment to hire 100 000 new teachers and to reduce class sizes i am concerned by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited english proficiency these funds support the training and retraining of bilingual teachers the disparities in minority education will be increased if this bill is passed secondly this bill severely shortchanges programs that assist displaced workers this is a major issue for my constituents in el paso as i know that it is for many of you in your home districts in el paso and in other areas along the unitedstates mexico border nafta has created many displaced workers and this bill does an injustice to programs that could help them for example the bill cuts assistance to over 215 000 dislocated workers and it cuts the dislocated worker program by 207 million below the 2000 level these cuts will make it more difficult for these workers to find jobs this bill also cuts adult job training for almost 40 000 adults the cuts in adult training programs equal 93 million or 10 percent below the request and 2000 levels finally this bill provides only 9 6 million for employment assistance to another class of displaced workers our homeless veterans there are over a quarter million homeless veterans in this country and the provisions in this bill will deny employment assistance to thousands of these americans who have faithfully served their country this is unacceptable the root of these problems is that in order to pay for the proposed republican trilliondollar tax breaks for the wealthiest americans we are attacking programs that are needed to educate our children and to assist displaced workers again i stand in

they understand this defense budget they know their stuff and they know it in detail they are truly legislative craftsmen however i want to get some things off my chest nonetheless about this bill and the context in which it is being presented the president presented to the congress a defense bill which had a hefty 16 billion 6 percent increase it contained the presidents recommendation for a military pay raise it made sure that we hit the 60 billion target for procurement and it was presented to the congress in the context of other administration initiatives to also make needed investments in education in health care in science and in environmental cleanup across the board this bill comes to us in a quite different context this bill raises the presidents request for the military budget by 4 billion and it does so at the same time that it requires that we cut over the next 5 years 125 billion out of domestic programs for education health care and the like it also does so in the context of the majority party insistence that we pass in piecemeal fashion tax cuts largely aimed at the wealthiest people in our society which will total over 700 billion over that same time period we cannot do all of those things and meet the obligations we have to this society we are not going to be able to eliminate the debt that everyone promises we are going to eliminate if the majority party insists on tax cuts of those magnitude especially aimed wherethey aim them if they do insist on those tax cuts then something else has to give in my opinion i want to simply point out one thing about this bill this chart demonstrates what we spend versus what everybody else in the world spends on defense we are now spending 266 billion represented by that blue bar nato is spending 227 billion the last time i looked they were on our side if we take a look at what they spend our potential main opponents russia is spending 54 billion china 37 billion iran 6 billion north korea 2 billion libya 1 billion that is not the picture of a country in trouble in terms of defense preparedness despite these gross differences i would be willing to support this bill if it were presented in a balanced context if it were not presented at the same time that the majority party is asking us to provide billions of dollars in excessive tax cuts and in the context of what is happening on the other side of the budget where we are forcing a huge squeeze on education on health care on job training and the rest in that context i do not believe this bill makes sufficiently tough choices in a number of areas most especially with respect to the aircraft choices being made by the pentagon i have in the committee report listed my concerns most especially my concerns about the f22 we have been given three separate caution flags by agenciesthat we ought to pay attention to the pentagons director of operational testing and evaluations the committees own surveys and investigation staff and the general accounting office which said we should be producing no more than six of those aircraft instead of the expanded number in the bill i think that is just one example of the choices which this congress is not making that it should be making if it is going to impose much deeper reductions and a much tighter squeeze on the rest of the budget so if members want my vote for a bill like this they have to bring it to the floor in the context of a better balance between what we are doing to deal with our education problems our health care problems our national security problems and most especially what we are doing on the tax side of the aisle we could afford the tax cuts we are talking about if we were not trying to fund increases like this maybe but we certainly cannot afford them both it is about time this congress makes some of the tough choices in this bill that it is making in other bills or else recognize that there is no room in the budget for the excess of tax cuts that

without delay before our adjournment for the year we have missed opportunities after opportunities to stop our partisan wrangling and pass a meaningful bill and reach the priorities that we need to

in communities throughout my district and across this country our schools are bursting at the seams our local communities are struggling to provide resources to build new schools and to repair old ones and get children out of trailers and just fix up old rundown buildings for nearly 4 years now i have worked with my colleagues in the house on both sides of the political aisle to provide leadership on this important issue and pass a common sense bill that will help our local schools deal with this critical problem we have come together to support h r 4094 the rangeljohnsonetheridge bill that is sponsored by the republican congresswoman from connecticut and my friend from new york this important bill will provide 25 billion in school construction bonds for our local communities to build schools for our children it really provides national leadership on this issue that is critical to the american people a clear majority of the members of this house have supported h r 4094 228 members democrats and republicans alike have signed on as cosponsors the house will pass this bill if we can only get a chance to vote on it the president has stated that he will sign this important legislation the minute it reaches his desk we have an opportunity to provide real leadership and pass this measure to help provide educational opportunities for our children but unfortunately the republican leadership of this house has chosen the path of confrontation and gridlock over the opportunity for consensus and progress rather than working together to produce a common sense solution to the need for school construction the republican leadership brought to the floor today a bill that was a sham of a school construction measure instead of fully funding the costeffective rangeljohnson bill the republican leaderships bill would shift funds to much less effective arbitrage relief and private activity bonds the arbitrage proposal would provide schools with only 24 per 1 000 in bonds compared with 624 per 1 000 in bonds in the rangeljohnson bill in addition because schools would have to delay construction for at least 2 years to receive any benefits areas with the most urgent need would not be able to build the buildings that they need the private activity bonds benefit only those schools available to find a forprofit company willing to pay upfront construction costs neither arbitrage nor private activity bonds target assistance to the schools that so badly need it today the members of this house have an obligation a solemn responsibility in my opinion to work together to craft common sense solutions to the problems facing americas schools but rather we do not work hard to meet the responsibility that is before us the republican leadership has chosen to pass a sham proposal a bill that is truly going to be vetoed they knew it was going to be vetoed when it passed today the republican tax bill contains many provisions that i supported but the sad fact is the republican leadership chose to include many good provisions in a fundamentally flawed bill in addition the leadership today pushed through an appropriations bill that provides 687 million in grants to states to build prisons i supported that provision because we probably need to build some but to me it is the wrong priority to pass prisons before we build schools in conclusion i remain an optimist

delaying the automatic 15 percent cut in home healthcare funding upon implementation of the prospective payment system pps and for the enactment of the pps in a timely fashion at the end of the year

pennsylvania the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce has stated again which has already been stated several times we are not talking about a difference in money here at all the 1 75 billion is in the labor hhs education bill it is a controversial bill but not about that sum of money i think we all know that that sum of money will survive all of this as a matter of fact 75 percent of it will be used for the exact purpose that is talked about in the motion to instruct conferees offered by the gentleman from oregon mr wu the reduction of class size and a balance to be used for teacher training this is not a block grant situation but the balance will be used for teacher training so we are talking about a minor degree of flexibility here is what i would ask everybody to do maybe there are some people listening in their offices and they have a moment to do this before they vote on this or on the labor hhs bill but to call their governors up i do not care if they are republicans or democrats and ask them about this ask them if they want it mandated that they have to use all this money to hire teachers or if they could have some flexibility to use some of the money for teacher training i would be willing to wager a small bet if you will that 100 percent of those answers would be give us whatever flexibility you can in order to use that money so we can accommodate our state and our local school districts as best we can at a recent committee hearing i asked secretary riley who of course is a former governor if he would prefer to have some measure of flexibility in the use of federal funding which as my colleagues will recall it accounts for about 6 percent of all federal spending and he was unresponsive to that but i would point out that the one issue i know of that all of the governors got behind in the last couple of years and that has been referred to by the gentleman from oregon mr wu too is the education flexibility partnership act which i think speaks volumes about flexibility in this area it is called ed flex we did get it passed we all agreed to it in every way we possibly could so my judgment is that we are talking about flexibility we are talking about giving us the opportunity to be able to spend money properly let me finally just say this and i will quote we can reduce the education gap between rich and poor students by giving schools greater flexibility to spend money in ways they think most effective like reducing class sizes in early grades they are also those who support and again i quote granting expanded decisionmaking powers at the school level empowering principals teachers and parents with increased flexibility in educating our children and that ends the quote we have fought a lot about this but it is interesting to note that those quotes that i just gave my colleagues are two principles which can be found on page 86 of then governor bill clinton and senator al gores book putting people first i think we can all agree that education flexibility is what is needed here twentyfive percent of this money is for choice of the district they can use it all for class size reduction if they want they even have that option as well let us give them the flexibility and i politely say that because i respect what the gentleman from oregon mr wu is trying to do but i would urge all of us to turn down the motion to instruct conferees to give the flexibility to the states to improve education for all of our children i yield back the balance of my time mr wu i yield myself such time as i may consume the facts are sometimes inconvenient facts can be somewhat inconvenient we have been hearing that there is no difference between what would happen if we did not pass this motion and what would be happening under last years appropriations and next years appropriations that is absolutely not true that is absolutely not true class size reduction program a 30 percent increase that would not happen if we go home under a continuing resolution as is currently proposed next school renovation school renovation there will be no school renovation money if we go home under a continuing resolution as is currently proposed next 21st century community learning centers offering families a safe place and their children to learn there is 100 percent increase in funding for 21st century community learning centers that would not occur if we go home without this next new appropriation completely done eisenhower professional development grants a twothirds increase for the eisenhower grants finally pell grants a 500 increase in pell grants that would not occur not occur if we go home under a continuing resolution rather than getting the work of the house done why have we not been getting the work of the house done we did reach agreement on all of these education issues but the deal was broken i noticed this motion on sunday with an intent to bring it up on monday but we had an agreement as of sunday night because powerful special interests called into the republican leadership and i do not fault the gentleman from pennsylvania chairman goodling and i do not fault the gentleman from delaware for this but because telephone calls were made that deal to increase education funding to increase pell grants to increase 21st center learning centers to increase teachers to reduce class size that deal was broken in my congressional district i commissioned a study on class size only 6 4 percent of students in my congressional district are in class sizes of 18 or fewer the other students the other 94 percent of oregons students in the 1st congressional district are equally split between class sizes of 19 to 24 students or 25 or more more devastatingly in clackamas county almost 50 percent of students in kindergarten through third grade are in class sizes of 25 or more in multnomah county portland the percentage of students in grades k through 3 in classes of 25 or more is also at almost 50 percent in washington county it is more than onethird of the students in yamhill county it is almost onethird of the students this is a program which makes a difference i saw it i visit schools all the time as my colleagues do at reedville elementary school in aloha it worked exactly as intended by adding only one additional first grade teacher it brought the average class size down from 27 students to 18 students with all due respect the studies do show that when we bring class size down from 27 to 18 it makes a measurable difference which lasts over the years the sage study from wisconsin demonstrates that the star study from tennessee demonstrates that and even the program in california which has been very difficult to measure indicates that in the third grade there are measurable differences but the fact is this this class size initiative makes a difference i have seen it make a difference i have seen it cut class size from 27 to 18 but it is not

true for certain nonminority lowincome rural communities as well the two questions we must have the courage and the determination to answer are why and what can be done about it it takes courage because the admission of the problem moves us all out of our comfort zone in which we are all too content to just let racial and ethnic and class disparities improve on their own and work themselves out over time it takes determination because there is no easy answer in fact many health care experts sharply disagree on all the underlying causes of health disparities all of this takes determination because there is no easy answer in fact many health care experts sharply disagree on all the underlying causes of health disparities many point to the role of continued income disparities others to discrimination in diagnosis and prescribed treatments some point out a lack of training in our medical schools concerning racial gender and ethnic differences in symptoms

integrated wildlife management techniques and strategies to minimize the negative impacts of wildlife on livestock and crops human health and safety property and threatened and endangered species if this amendment were to pass the 7 million the defazio amendment would redirect the 10 million in additional funds by prohibiting their use for livestock protection programs because of the cooperative nature of this program a 7 million cut and a redirection of funds actually results in a total loss in the program of 23 7 million now this also will knock out 2 million of the bills appropriated funds to increase wildlife services that will be dealing with the rabies control program and collaborations the defazio amendment would not only cause a loss of 2 million for this important program but

have developed a version of the legislation that is acceptable to all these parties this is no small feat in the world of patent policy and i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner the gentleman from california the gentlewoman from maryland the subcommittee chair and the gentleman from michigan the subcommittee ranking democrat for their hard work which has put us in this enviable position h r 209 is the first comprehensive review of federal patent policy in 15 years the 1980 bayhdole act which it amends has made a major difference in the commercialization of federal inventions before bayhdole passed it was relatively rare for inventions resulting from federal research to reach their market potential as many as 20 000 federal inventions were patented but not licensed only two or three inventions at that point had achieved royalties as high as a million dollars and the total royalty stream for the entire federal government at that time was less than the royalties received by a midsized university today bayhdole has opened major opportunities to research universities like the university of colorado which is in my district in colorado it has been a major contributor to the outreach activities of contractoroperated laboratories like the national renewable energy laboratory located also in colorado it has led to benefits for federally employed inventors and their laboratories including nist and noaa at the department of commerce and throughout the government over the 19 years since the enactment of the bayhdole act we have learned of the need for some improvements the bill before us takes advantage of the lessons learned and is intended to make the law more user friendly it also updates the act to reflect the new ways that industry now gets and shares information one important section of the bill developed by the gentlewoman from california deserves special mention that section provides for the committee on national security part of the office of science and technology policy to work with affected agencies to make sure that major cooperative research and development agreements get proper interagency review some of these cooperative agreements involve issues of national security domestic competitiveness and even international competitiveness these clearly extend beyond the expertise of the contracting agency and interagency clearance will permit resolution of significant issues before agreements are signed we are pleased that the committee on national security has begun its work in anticipation of the passage of this provision and that they are also examining analogous situations that involve work for others agreements and patent licensing h r 209 is very similar to legislation that passed the house twice last congress a handful of improvements have been made at the suggestion of the senate judiciary committee jurisdictional differences in the senate also appear to have been worked out so it is our hope that if we can pass this bill today it will be considered in the near future by the senate and cleared by the president perhaps this month i urge passage of the bill i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
