you for what you have done it is appropriate that the 30 omething group is advocating advancing in a new direction because this new direction is absolutely essential for young people in our country our 30somethings are committed to a better future for all americans so is our new direction a newdirection for all americans not just the privileged few we can begin with our six for 06 to make america safer we will begin by passing the 9 11 commission recommendations we have just observed the fifth anniversary of 9 11 here we are 5 years after 9 11 the commission is giving the federal government ds and fs and incompletes for implementation of their recommendations the first day of congress we will pass the 9 11 commission recommendations and make america safer we will make our economy fairer and we will begin by passing the minimum wage we can do it next week the bill is in the hopper to make our economy fair we can pass the minimum wage and certainly not have congress have any increase in its salary until there is an increase and unless there is an increase in the minimum wage we can also remove the incentives for companies to send jobs overseas imagine taxpayers are giving incentives for companies to send job overseas we will end that we will make colleges more affordable it is important to broaden the opportunity for a college education and we will begin by making college tuition tax deductible and cutting in half the interest on student loans we will make health care more affordable and we will begin by allowing the government to negotiate for lower prices for prescription drugs and we will promote stem cell research that is better for a healthy america we will move towards energy independence that our colleagues were talking about here we will begin by repealing the subsidies that have been given to big oil and big energy compa nies and instead use that 18 billion for research in alternative energy resources every day that we are here we will work for a dignified retirement by preserving social security protecting pensions and encouraging savings for americas seniors this we will do within the first 100 hours of a new congress given the opportunity but we could do it now even before congress leaves instead we have a donothing rubberstamp congress i see the rubber stamp here here we are just a few days from the end of the fiscal year and this congress has still not passed the budget for this fiscal year how could it be a week before the end of the fiscal year and this donothing congress has not even passed the budget in addition we have a crying need in our country for comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform we certainly are not moving in any direction to make that possible the list goes on we havent finished our appropriations bills we shouldnt leave here until we have an increase in the minimum wage but when we return and hopefully with a verdict from the american people we will get about the peoples business the issues that are relevant to the lives of the american people their jobs their health care their economic security the health care for their families the education of their children safe america safe neighborhoods and a secure america with energy independence we will do all of this from the very first day with integrity our first rule that members will vote on will be for integrity to sever the link between special interests and legislation so that we are here for the peoples interest instead with civility with bipartisan administration of the house so that every voice in the country is heard not only the voices of those who happen to have their member be in the majority and we will do it with fiscal discipline no more deficit spending pay as you go audit the books account

federal income tax returns a duty of citizenship that provokes anxiety confusion and yes even anger in many taxpayers every year without question the internal revenue code has become a maze of complexity that confounds millions of americans including i think all of us who will speak it treats many taxpayers unfairly and it creates an opportunity some would say an incentive for those who would exploit its complexity to avoid compliance thus placing an unfair share on others as nina olson said the national taxpayer advocate stated in december in her annual report to congress the most serious problem facing taxpayers and the irs alike is the complexity of the internal revenue code the only meaningful way to reduce these compliance burdens is to simplify the tax code enormously so said nina olson the national taxpayer advocate all of us of course bear some responsibility for the complexity of our tax code democrats and republicans and every american who believes that the tax preferences that he or she utilizes are worthwhile considered individually the tax preferences that clutter the code certainly can be rationalized and explained collectively however they are a jumble of confusion that have a corrosive effect on our democracy as paul oneill the former secretary of the treasury said one of the unseen consequences of the tax codes complexity is the sense it leaves taxpayers that the system is unfair and that others pay less tax because of special advantages almost every american i think feels that including those who take special advantage a few facts illustrate the scope of the problem in 1913 the tax code was a mere 500 pages in length today the code and regulations total more than 60 000 pages four common forms form 1040 and schedules a b and d take an estimated 28 hours and 30 minutes to prepare think of that they are relatively simple forms when the irs started tracking this information in 1988 the average paperwork burden was 17 hours and 7 minutes about 11 hours less even the simplest form in the irs inventory a 1040 ez perhaps misnamed now requires 3 hours and 43 minutes for the average taxpayer to prepare up from 1 hour and 31 minutes in 1988 complexity costs more than 100 billion that cost is in accounting fees and the value of taxpayers time to complete their returns this is roughly equivalent to what we spend to run the department of education homeland security and state think of it the cost of complexity for our taxpayers 100 billion more than we spend on the department of education homeland security and the department of state not surprisingly more americans than ever rely on tax professionals i know i do nearly 60 percent rely on tax professionals today compared to 48 percent in 1990 if the administrative burden does not convince you that reform is crucial the crisis in noncompliance should theirs has estimated there is a 311 billion annual tax gap due to underreporting underpayment and nonfiling think of that 311 billion the bad news is that the budget deficits we are running up under this administration and the republican leadership this coming year will be over 400 billion so even
