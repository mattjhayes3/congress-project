senate minority leader bob dole over a presidents authority to send american forces to foreign countries without congressional approval the debate in the senate illustrates the continuing concern in congress over the worsening political and economic crisis in haiti as early as january of this year i wrote to president clinton urging him to lift trade sanctions against haiti currently the united states is enforcing an embargo begun by the organization of american states which prohibits nearly all trade with haiti the only exceptions being humanitarian goods such as food and medicine the trouble with this policy i argued to the president is that it has had little effect in restoring democratic rule to that desperately poor country i also wrote however there is widespread agreement that the embargo has had one devastating effect it has forced the haitian people into even deeper economic deprivation that is even truer today haiti is ruled by ruthless military officers whose main

hand the grinding poverty and economic chaos a countrys economy even in an economic basket case like haiti is actually a patchwork of transactions destroying one part leads to the devastation of other parts that is why the international sanctions cannot help but destroy what little semblance of commerce once existed in haiti also exempting food and medicine has not saved the haitian people from nearstarvation and an almost complete shutdown of haitis rudimentary health care system on october 21 the washington post in a frontpage story reported that even aristides staunchest supporters now

will actually abide by the rules of the house all of this is nothing more than a waste of time"], [0.00020635128021240234, 0.5002063512802124, 0, "this amendment would allow students and teachers in public schools across the nation to voluntarily pray my amendment is identical to the language offered february 23 by the gentleman from tennessee in fact it is mr duncans language which was overwhelmingly supported by the members of this body by a margin of 367 to 55 as you will remember the house voted to instruct conferees on goals 2000 to accept a senate amendment of the same language which i am offering now the other body passed this same language by a steadfast 75to22 vote judging by these margins this congress supports protecting the constitutional right of children to pray let me just tell you a couple of stories one which is out of st louis where kids were in school and one of them a 10yearold boy was praying before eating his lunch on three separate occasions finally he was disciplined with detention during recreation periods for 1 week the boys mother was told that it was against the law to pray in school and that the decision to punish her son would not be overturned that is not america that is not what this country was built on this country is one nation under god and prayer is part of our legal right the congress this congress will not tolerate abridgement of this right nor discrimination against those who would seek to exercise it there is no better time than today on this bill for congress to take action to protect the constitutional right to freely practice ones religion when i was in school participation in religious programs the pledge of allegiance pregame prayers were every day occurrences in fact the ten commandments were posted on the walls i i think even today right here in washington dc we see that coming back when marion barry who used to be the mayor and is currently a councilman said with all the violence and other problems we need to get back to trying to allow those who want to pray to do it barry said referring to shootings and beatings in the schools it may set a moral tone at the schools that is out of the paper you all read it i think you realize and so does the rest of the country finally realizing that it is time to get prayer back to school when i took my oath of office i pledged to uphold the constitution just like every member of this body and that is what we would do today by passing this amendment the courts have affirmed that students in public schools do not shed their constitutional right to freedom of speech or expression at the school gatehouse that is from wallace versus jeffrey the court concluded that there is no constitutional barrier to a state protecting every students right to engage in voluntary prayer it does not require state education agencies or local education agencies to do anything except uphold our constitution an abiding belief in and a love of god were the building blocks of our founding fathers that laid the foundation for this wonderful nation this nations heritage is rooted in religious faith i believe those same values have helped to maintain its strength over 200 years ago george washington affirmed this belief when he stated of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports and i believe that the omission of voluntary prayer in school removes from children the very values on which this great nation was founded the right to voluntary prayer is vital to the future of our children and this nation i think we need to put this amendment on this bill just to uphold that right by voting for this amendment today you would be casting a vote to uphold the unitedstates constitution you are fighting discrimination against voluntary prayer but above all you are allowing our children who are the future of our nation the freedom to pray"], [0.0002777278423309326,

research be cut by 50 percent from an estimated 1 8 billion to 900 million i must observe that if anyone in this body believed that this cut was going to stand up in the senate or in conference we would be hearing howls of range as it is we hear no howls and no rage the silence on this cut is deafening but for those of us who are old hands in this institution it speaks volumes if this cut stood some of our most prestigious institutions of education and research would be severely damaged among the top ten recipients of dod funding one finds the university of texas the massachusetts institute of technology johns hopkins university the university of washington georgia tech and stanford university i may not be muchof a vote counter but a coalition that includes members from the states of texas massachusetts maryland georgia california and h 5421the speakers home state of washington is not a bad base from which to start if there needs to be a legislative fix to this problem i am confident one would be engineered if this cut stood it would directly undermine the department of defenses science and technology strategy and the presidents technology plan dod support for research at universities is focused on areas of particular concern to the department electrical engineering laser and optical sciences materials science applied mathematics and computer science these same fields are among the areas of emphasis laid out by the president in his technology initiatives in short the research cuts that are recommended in the report accompanying this bill provide direct support for advanced technology development at the department of defense they also represent a critical investment in the future of both our national security and our economic vitality with all the dire consequences that wouldbe provoked by this cut our silence may be difficult for the public especially our friends in universities around the nation to understand i will explain it for their benefit all of us here in this body assume and i think correctly that this problem will go away in the senate and in conference and the money will be restored there is no fight over this cut because for all practical purposes there is no cut to fight over 1 want to make two additional points its been said that nothing is given so profusely as advice this entire 300 page report from the appropriations committee is full of nothing but advicesome of it very detailed the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania made this very point on monday during the full committee consideration of this bill as this report simply contains recommendations the department can consider and reject that advice if it fails to fit with the priorities of the department secondly despite the fiscal constraints that inspired the 50 percent cut in university research this bill and report includes at least 67 million in academic earmarks according to an analysis by my staff in addition there are tens of millions in other very detailed spending instructions to the department some of which are certainly for academic earmarks while this is down considerably from years before and represents a standard to which we should hold this bill when it comes back from conference it is still a cause for concern i will enter a list of known academic earmarks for the record finally i note that press reports regarding the cuts in university research have quoted my colleague from pennsylvania as expressing a concern regarding the costs of research overhead i assure him that 1 share his concerns regarding indirect costs and my committee has held a hearing on this issue i would be happy to hold joint hearings with my friend if he would ike to work with me to address this issue"],

good things we need to have flexibility so that the states can do the experimentation also on the antitrust things that mr burton talked about we need to pass some federal law to make the laws so that experimentation can move forward on a nationwide basis because sometimes there are constraints to doing that"]]}
