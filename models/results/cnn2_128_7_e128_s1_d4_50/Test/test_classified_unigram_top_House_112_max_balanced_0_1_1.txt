national average in 2010 and yet they still rush to protect billions in oil company subsidies even as they cut the budget of the agency we know can do something about this speculation cftc has already

its an unavoidable part of our power generation in southwestern pennsylvania though the commonwealth of pennsylvania has some of the toughest coal ash disposal standards in the country ive been convinced that coal ash needs to be federally regulated under the resource conservation and recovery act however this motion to instruct does not fully encompass my position on the issue although this motion to instruct calls on conferees to insist upon the house language on coal ash that is not the whole story in fact i support the coal ash language that the bipartisan group of senators is working on ive seen much of the work theyve been doing and i can tell you that i believe it to be an improvement on what were doing here in the house the question is will the conferees agree to a bill at all and will it include coal ash my vote in favor of this motion is meant to urge my colleagues to finish the process so that we can resolve the coal ash issue in a way thats good for the environment our constituents and the purposes of recycling these materials i want to make it clear that i do not believe that any coal ash or keystone provisions should be used to hold up the transportation bill conference above all else it is essential that this congress does its job and completes the highway bill conference before the current program expires on june 30 i continue to support the federal

said the talent for avoiding failure is not a great trait in fact the easiest way that someone can avoid making a mistake is just being too slow to get to the ball with all due respect this administration and my good friends on the other side are simply too slow to get to the ball the background or the basis of their arguments against this particular rule for this particular bill is they wish to fund transportation programs the oldfashioned way which means we spend money we dont have what were trying to do with this particular bill is go outside of the box and find a way to actually pay for infrastructure improvements a way to pay for our transportation needs and to do it with energy development like we all have a problem with escalating prices of gas at the pump for the most vulnerable of our society we have a problem with them paying for heating oil economic development business development demands a cheap source of energy if its going to happen and we need to find a way to fund our infrastructure needs and we are wrapping them all together by paying for it with economic energy development who can possibly be opposed to that even the president of the united states in one of his arguments for having a payroll tax increase said the reason we need to do it is because we are paying too much money at the pump for gasoline which i think is justifiable in his case when president obama came into office the average cost of gasoline was 1 79 today the average cost for a gallon of gasoline not inflated prices just same dollars is 3 28 thats an 83 percent increase in the cost at the pump since president obama has been in office now we asked in the rules committee the other day if we went back to the oldfashioned way of paying for transportation and just paid for it out of gas taxes how much would we have to raise to fund this particular program and the guesstimate at that time was around 20 cents a gallon20 cents a gallon even if you had a small car thats still two to three bucks a time every time you went to fill up at that rate nobody in the car can afford a big gulp basically what were trying to do on the republican side is allow people to drive with good drinks on good roads our friends on the other side apparently want us to walk or if we have good roads you have to pay significantly more for it that simply is wrong we have problems with heating oil in this country the other sides approach to it is simply freeze in the dark there is a better way of doing it and this bill these bills try to accomplish that the other day we heard in the rules committee that there is no oil in anwr that comes as a great surprise to people who live in alaska which is maybe one of the reasons why the state legislature of alaska has asked us to please allow them to have access to their resources the native americans who live near anwr have asked us and begged us to please allow them to have job production by allowing them to be able to get to the resources of their area and indeed if we had not usurped the control of the lands of those people this would have happened well before that even president carter has suggested that this particular area in anwr is where we should be developing our oil and gas resources and thats specifically why it was put there the fact that we havent done it is nothing more than a dissatisfaction and a shame on us as the unitedstates congress i heard the other day that there is no plan for oil shale development we have no technology to do it even though estonia has been doing it for over 100 years in a way that has minimal amount of water thats used last year they produced 1 3 million barrels meeting the european union environmental standards my friends over in germany who are trying to get away from nuclear are looking to estonia and using their oil shale to supplement what they need and we dont have the technology to go forward with that we are looking in the western states as a saudi arabia of oil shale we have more energy potential in those three states than there is in saudi arabia and all we are asking to do is be allowed to deal with it in the 2000s the professionals on the ground they did the study they charted the land they held the town meetings and they came up with a plan that this administration threw out the window arbitrarily making a political deal to stop that what were asking is to go back to that as our starting foundation what the professionals on the ground did use that as our basis to start moving forward in this particular area i heard that the cbo said theres no money to be gained out of it theres no energy from that what the cbo actually said is of course there is but by scoring ityoure not going to score in the futureits zero because you already know whats going to happen in the future it is there it is possible and we can do it we want alternative energy we certainly want more solar power as long as youre not bailing out failed programs we want more wind power especially off the coast of massachusetts we just want to have every elementevery elementof our energy portfolio developed including what we have here in the united states these bills do just that let me figure out one last reason to do it its for kids i live in a state where 70 percent of the land is owned by the federal government that means quite simply when we try to fund our education system we cannot charge property tax on our land when you stop by arbitrary decisions of the department of energy developing resources we dont get income tax from highpaying jobs we dont get severance tax and we dont get royalty payments that means the 12 western states that have all the blm lands grew their education funding over the last 3 years at a 35 percent rate thats not bad but every state east that has no blm land that doesnt have these kinds of restrictions grew their education funding at 68 percent almost two to one thats the difference thats the reality what we are doing when we stop energy development its hurting kids in the westmy kids their education opportunities are retarded simply because we do not allow the development of resources that are there and that should be done look were asking you simply to allow us to develop these lands and in so doing make it possible to have cheaper gas at the pump make it possible to heat our homes cheaply make it possible for energy development that goes on energy cheap energy and build infrastructure with it at the same time to develop our potential all i want you to do is to follow the words that are printed above you on that wall where it simply says let us develop the resources of our land call forth its powers and see whether in our day and generation we may not perform something worthy to be remembered it is time for us to do something worthy to be remembered by developing our resources using it to pay for infrastructure and for heavens sake for once
