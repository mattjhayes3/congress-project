urges the president of the united states to take appropriate action to protect unitedstates exports of corn gluten feed much as i would prefer a situation wlich would not demand this action i firmly believe that the congress of the united states must rally behind the cause of multilateral trade negotiations and against the dangerous precedent which would be established by the european community if it takes action to breach the negotiated concessions regarding imports of corn gluten feeds from the united states the european community ec is an important export market for unitedstates feed grain substitutes accounting last year for 4 million tons valued at 684 million corn gluten feed made up the major part of those exports reaching nearly 2 5 million tons valued at nearly 500 million corn gluten feed a byproduct of the wet milling process of obtaining starch sweeteners and ethanol from corn is used as a livestock feed ingredient purchases by the ec have accounted for 99 percent of all unitedstates corn gluten feed exports our product is favored by ec livestock feeders over their comparatively higher priced domestic grains wheat and barley the higher ec prices paid to its producers are a result of the communitys domestic grain price system and import policies which support grain produced within the ec at prices said to be almost twice that of world market prices generally ec grain prices are protected from competition from cheaper imported grains by means of high import levies however as a result of previous multilateral trade agreements the ecs import levy system does not apply to most grain substitutes including corn gluten feed the ec in exchange for concessions from the united states agreed to bind or fix their external duties on corn gluten feed at zero to emphasize this point the current dutyfree status of corn gluten was a concession granted to the united states and the united states paid for that concession by giving concessions to the europeans there is a growing concern in the unitedstates corn refining industry and in many other sectors of american agriculture as well that abrogation of the zeroduty concession on corn gluten feeds by the ec could lead to similar protective tariffs and quotas for other commodities involving unitedstates exports a study prepared by the congressional research service for senator charles percy of illinois concluded that if the ecs zero binding on corn gluten feeds were removed net farm income in the united states would be reduced by 100 million in 1983 further the crs study noted that if the ec imposed a duty on corn gluten it would probably have to take similar action on other imported feedstuffs such as soybeans soybean meal and other nongrain feed ingredients if the ec is to meet an objective of reducing common agricultural policy expenditures and increasing the use of indig enously produced feed grains any such unilateral action as has been proposed within the european community strikes at the very heart of the delicate but working balance of multilateral trade agreements already reached a similar resolution was adopted by the senate april 15 identical in language to the resolution now before the house the senate resolution was introduced by senator percy senator jesse helms chairman of the agriculture committee and senator robert dole chairman of the finance committee they were joined by a number of other senators in support of the resolution transcending the immediate economic consequences of any unilateral action that might be taken by the ec it seems to me that this resolution serves the worthwhile pur pose of putting the ec on notice that the congress is joined in its resolve to uphold commitments made at the negotiating table and that it expects its trading partners to honor their commitments as well i urge the passage of house resolution 435"], [0.002795841544866562, 0.002795841544866562, 0, "if the gentleman would yield further a few

percent of the public saying that they think that is the way we ought to go reducing spending got virtually half got 50 percent of the public saying that that is what they wanted to do both reducing

million and 8 million who reside in the united states itself and on the island of puerto rico last week while speaking in dallas tex the chairman of the private sector survey on cost control mr j

mainland but then went on to also talk about the puerto ricans who live in puerto rico and stating thatthe food stamp program is basically a subsidy program for the puerto ricans i take offense with that because both you and i know that poverty is no joke yes there are many persons in this country 2q million to be exact who today are forced to use food stamps as a way of life most of these people if not all of these people prefer not to have a handout what they prefer is to find a mechanism by which we can give them a handup mr grace has since stated in the new york times and in several periodicals of course that have come out in various parts of the nation that he made an oratorical mistake and that lie apologizes for making that oratorical mistake an oratorical mistake may be one thing but a slip is yet something else this is not the first time that the poor of this nation have been faced with an insensitive person at the helm talking about making certain that the private sector and the trickledown theory can function and that we should be much more sensitive toward following that road and that example my feeling about that is as the chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus and as a proud puerto rican a person who was born in the city i represent the city of new york but of two parents who arrived in new york just as many other people have arrived just looking for a better way of life andtrying to raise a family to make certain that we all had our education mr grace was born in a totally different atmosphere he was born in an atmosphere of polo

apology we will accept is if and when mr grace steps down from that position as the head of this government watchdog committee it seems to me that those who may understand the words oratorical mistake may compare it to what we call a poets license or poetic license in which a poet has discretion to write words as he sees fit to make the poem a complete poem and to be able to have that poem interpreted he does not have a poetic license and my sense of what he said was that those statements would never have been made had they been made before the american grain association who was having their meeting or their convention let us say in the city of new york why should he pick dallas why should he pick dallas to make those statements because he probably felt secure that in the city of

the threat which it faces i would like to touch upon a few facts which i think are pertinent as we consider this defense bill first of all i call your attention to the comment of leonid brezhnev when he was addressing the warsaw pact heads of government back in 1973 the heads of those warsaw pact nations who were meeting with him were concerned about his feelings about detente and so they were putting him on the spot so to speak about his support of detente his answer to them was this trust us comrades for by 1985 as a consequence of what we are now achieving with detente we will have achieved most of our objectives in western europe and the shift in the correlation of forces will be such that come 1985 we will be able to exert our will wherever we need to that was back in 1973 i would like to call your attention now to some statistics that back up exactly what mr brezhnev was saying the soviets have set their goals they have achieved their schedules to their stated end thus far let us look at some of the statistics pertinent to the point turning first to the icbm and slbms strategic launchers in 1965 the soviets had 331 strategic launchers against our 1 100 today they have 2 426 and we have 1 710 strategic launchers let us look at the soviet ballistic missiles and on the same pattern in 1965 they had 107 while the united states had 496 today we have 656 and they have 1 028 let us look at the statistics with reference to the intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1965 the soviets had 224 while the united states had 654 today we have 1 028 while the soviets have 1 398 what i am saying to you is that we have not put a new ballistic missile on line since 1965 we have not put a new launcher on line since 1965 while the soviets have continued to increase their strength look at the soviet armed forces manpower with reference to ours today we have roughly 2 1 million men in our military the soviets have a military manpower of 3 6plus million what about total strategic warheads in 1965 the soviets had 530 while we had 2 716 but look how the imbalance has changed now we have a total of 6 282 while the soviets have 9 139 look at the trends see what has been happening over this period of time let us turn to soviet tanks in 1970 the soviets had 20 450 tanks today they have 26 768 we would be hard put to put 7 000 total in the field anywhere everywhere in the world what about the expernditures on defense as compared to social services we hear a lot of conversation about the fact that we are spending so much more on defense in comparison to our expenditures on social services let me review the statistics in 1960 we were spending roughly 30 percent on defense and roughly 31 percent on social services i am talking about all levels of government state and federal we are now spending 14 8 percent on defense and 49 1 on social services i just wanted to bring some of those statistics to bear because it shows that we are not spending

in this period of soaring inflation although h r 3659 falls far short of correcting all of those serious deficiencies it does keep faith with our fellow americans in the strategic bastions of the pacific and caribbean and it does i think keep these areas going for example capital improvement funds authorized for guam and the northern marianas would be used for port improvement and the upgrading of antiquated public facilities such as water and sewers american samoa as americas center of commerce in the south pacific is badly in need of improved harbor facilities moreover the 15 million in guaranteed federal loans for power generation is absolutely essential to repair existing facilities and to accommodate future expansion in american samoa and finally the virgin islands sorely needs to improve its water and power distribution systems americas offshore areas in the p~acific and the caribbean are not only strategically important in the military sense but they also contribute significantly to americas international image as showcases of our way of life as a matter of fact just this weekend secretary of state alexander haig met with representatives from venezuela mexico and canada to start putting together a formula for assisting the caribbean and nations surrounding its rim certainly if we are going to have any kind of a meaningful programand i might say that my understanding is most of this will be through the private sector although some of it will be through public fundscertainly if we are going to have that kind of a programn we have to start out and anchor it with meaningful programs for our very own possessions and territories in the area the federal moneys allocated to offshore areas therefore are not giveaways at all they are sound investments in the future of all americans there has been concern expressed here about some of the specific projects and why they are not spelled out here the reason for that is that that is the job of the appropriations committee they held detailed hearings they have done that and one of the reasons they did not include in that all of the projects we are talking about here as i understand it is because there is no authorization that is what this bill is for so i urge the passage of this legislation mr ds lugo will the gentleman yield"], [0.9795700963586569, 0.020429903641343117, 1, "let me say to

states expressing the views of that conference on the bill h r 746 the regulatory reform bill now pending before this subcommittee on administrative law and governmental relations of which i have the honor of being the chairman in early may as chairman of that subcommittee i requested an evaluation of our bufl from the judicial conference because i knew that the regulatory reform bills pending before both houses of congress as well as proposed amendments to those bills would have a significant impact on the court s ti judicial conference is in a uniqut bition to assess that impact since the conference operates as a sort of board of directors for the judiciary branch and since it is composed entirely of federal judges in response to my request the judicial corlqrence in a letter dated july 20 1981 addressed three distinct areas of concern the scope and standards of judicial review the level of judicial review and the race to the courthouse in administrative agency cases the conference restricted its comments to those portions of the bill which would have an impact upon the courts the position of the judicial conference is thatsome language in the pending legislation would force the courts to duplicate agency decisions and p~lace them in a policymaking role which is inappropriate for the judiciary in its letter the conference concluded that the present language of h r 46 and the senate companion measure s 1080 which provides for independent court review of agency action overreaches that goal and creates an unmanageable burden for the federal courts jse i july 23 1981 the conference bases this conclusion on its view that it is inappropriate that the judicial function become equated with complete oversight and redetermination of administrative agency decision the conference specifically opposes the creation of judicial review for the proceduresi emphasize procedures of agency decisionmaking which are required by these bills such as the determination of which rule~s are major the applicability of socalled hybrid rulemaking procedures and the contents of regulatory analysis the conference concludes that such judicial review would put the courts in the position of redetermining an agency factual decision whether the 100 million impact level had been reached and would require the courts to analyze the analysis that the agency used to reach their decision this would result in a dramatic increase in the number and complexity of the cases to be reviewed as well as a qualitative change in the depth of that review among the other positions set forth by the conference the conference also opposes the transfer of general jurisdiction over agency actions from the district courts to the courts of appeal because of the negative
