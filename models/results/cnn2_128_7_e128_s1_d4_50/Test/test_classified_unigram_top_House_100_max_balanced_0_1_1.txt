because there is some real politics being played of course on the house floor too because what we are doing is we are just taking the constitution and kind of ripping it up and throwing it away when it comes to the veto power of the president what we are doing here is a real attempt not only to protect conservative democrats i would say to my colleague the gentleman from massachusetts but to protect the liberal democrats as well a bunch of them voted against this bill and guess what what they would have to do is vote to sustain the president in order to maintain that particular vote they do not want to do that the leftwing viscerally antimilitary dukakis wing of the party has absolutely no desire to vote on this veto so instead what we will do is send it into the pigeonhole of the armed services committee and what have we already heard as an admission on this floor tonight this bill is going nowhere after it goes into that pigeonhole we have already heard it said by the chairman of the committee himself that we will have a new vehicle and guess what we have already heard it said on the floor what that new vehicle is going to be it is going to be a continuing resolution one of those abominations that we always get at the end of the session that is not politics of course it is politics and it is absolutely wrong what is the reason why those presidential advisers wanted this bill signed nobody has mentioned the reason for it they thought this was the best abomination they could get this year that if it came back up here they would get an even worse abomination out of this congress so they decided they ought to take the best abomination they could get that is not exactly a good recommendation for the bill i am surprised to hear my democratic

in thanking him both for providing this time and for the thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country

drawers and shelves early in 1987 the project was completedover three years after it had been started what was once called the basement had become a classroom with audiovisual capabilities a workroom

modification of expiring provisions of the internal revenue code such worthwhile programs as employerprovided educational assistance the research and development tax credit the mortgage revenue bond program and the targeted jobs tax credit enjoy wide support here in congress and among taxpayers as well the fact that all of these important programs had to be reined in as they were reauthorized is bound to be a disappointment to some i am sorry that the reauthorizations could not be more generous but the way these extenders had to be modified reflects both the stark reality of the deficit and the scarcity of revenue i suggest that the extenders as they stand in the bill before us today are consistent with the spirit of tax reform we were able to retain useful programs by targeting them more precisely to those americans most in need of the benefits they confer the compromises that were made to get the extender package we have in this bill were not made lightly deciding how to pay for
