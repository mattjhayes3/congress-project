their minds health care came up quite a bit as i toured around my district there was great concern expressed by many people about what was going to happen in this congress with regardto health care reform were we going to get the bill clinton type health care reform that was going to put the government in a larger role with regard to health care that i and the constituents of my district would receive one issue that came up repeatedly was the issue of rationing we will not hear the proponents of these big government health bills talk about rationing we will hear words such as cost control trying to make health care more affordable but the fact is the american people are beginning to sense rather acutely that all of this means rationing what is rationing rationing means denying service for certain procedures to certain parts of our society that the government would decide is not in the best interest of the country as a whole in order to hold down costs last month in the committee on education and labor i offered an amendment during the markup of the presidents health care bill that would allow the american people to buy supplemental insurance policies in case they have been denied care in case they have been denied services under one of these big government bills during the debate on my amendment some interesting points were made by my colleagues on the democrat side of the aisle most notably by the gentleman from montana mr williams1 who is the chairman of the labor management subcommittee that had jurisdiction over this health care bill let me read what he had to say when we got into the discussion on my amendment but at the end of the day the only way the american people are really going to get health costs reduced is through some type of a competitive arrangement that moves toward restricting unnecessary procedures now who is going to decide what is necessary who is going to decide what is unnecessary we could all go through that forever sometimes this goes by the name of rationing the gentlemans amendment would allow an off ramp at least for those who could afford it to continue to pay more it seems to me that it may be that off ramp is necessary i am not as opposed to the gentlemans amendment as some of my colleagues onthis side bu what we have to decide as we vote here is do we want to restrain health care costs or dont we because the gentlemans amendment if in the final bill signed by the president is going to say health care costs are not going to be restrained to that great a degree because competition is not going to be managed no kind of rationing will be used for those people who can afford supplemental insurance they will get an off ramp and be able to continue to speed on with health care costs rising it is clear to me from the strongest proponents of this bill that the most onerous part of this legislation that came out of our committee is this attempt to control costs by limiting access to the system for those who may be in need of care today there are some who cannot afford health care insurance that is certainly a form of rationing and we would all like to fix that but i do not want to be the one

in some way give us gifts or assist us with travel i think we have to have a squeaky clean operation in the congress and i support that i rise tonight to speak briefly about something else that i believe is an important issue which must be addressed again it may not involve any wrongdoing but it certainly involves the perception of wrongdoing it is an issue that i have struggled with for some time it has come to focus in the last few weeks with an article in the september 12 issue of the new yorker i notice that representative iller circulated copies of that to our colleagues today but i read the original and decided at that time to speak on it before this body the title of the article is fee speech not free speech but fee speech free with the r removed this article talks about members of the media who are very critical of the congress for any perks we have real or imagined and who are very critical of the honoraria that members of congress used to receive in fact the bill we passed today not only prevents us from receiving honoraria which was alreadyprevented but also prevents us from receiving honoraria designated to charitable institutions when we speak to a group i think that is going too far but that is a aide issue but in this case i am speaking about the honoraria or the fees that reporters receive for speaking to groups about congress and speaking about issues of national importance this is an important issue it is not negligible i found it very interesting as the article points out that sam donaldson of abc displayed a certain ethical obtuseness by noting that just 4 days earlier before this reporters writing prime time live which sam donaldson coanchors had attacked the independent insurance agents of america for treating congressional staff people to a trip this is not even congressmen but congressional staff people to a key west trip yet several months earlier the same insurance group had paid donaldson a 30 000 lecture fee to speak to that group i can go through the many other examples here and i will take time at some later date to do that but the point the article makes is that many reporters not just sam donaldson but many reporters speak to the same groups that we deal with lobbying organizations associations of businesses they speak to these organizations for exorbitant fees ranging from 7 000 per speech up to 35 or 40 000 per speech and yet they are reporting on the activities of those very same groups they are reporting on the issues that these groups are lobbying in the congress about and what is fascinating is that the reporters who receive these amazing fees for speaking to these groups think there is nothing wrong with it their defense is as donaldson says i believe its not the appearance of impropriety thats the problem its impropriety and yet this is the same profession that says we must not display any appearance of impropriety there are others who when asked about this practice of theirs say its none of your business and when fred barnes who appears in the mclauglin group and other areas was asked how he would respond to a question posed by members of congress he said theyre elected officials im not an elected official im not in government i dont deal with taxpayers money and wolf blltzer cnn senior white house correspondent when asked what he would say to a member of

national media accepting very large speaking fees from organizations and then speaking to the american public through print through the electronic media about these various issues frankly the congress has very little power and individual congressmen have much less power than a major network news person they have a much greater impact on public policy and on shaping public opinion and i believe it

their loss i thank chairman dellums for his support of my amendment i also want to highlight provisions included in this en bloc amendment offered by mr hansen that would help communities retain important assets during base closures and realignments during the last round of base closures many communities were hampered in their conversion efforts by premature removal of materials and property from installations scheduled for closure wurtsmlth air force base in oscoda mi is a prime example the record of the air combat command and the air force base disposal agency during the closure process at wurtsmith has been disappointing community leaders around wurtsmith michigan state officials and federal elected officials have spent enormous time just trying to hold the air force to its own commitments including promises to retain key equipment on base during the closure process and to maintain certain properties intact the property disposal restrictions in this amendment would make certain that communities affected by the 1993 round of closures have full access to the resources at the facility that are essential to its successful conversion specifically the amendment would require that an inventory be conducted of all property and equipment at a facility scheduled for closure after which the recognized community redevelopment group will have a minimum of 1 year to decide whether or not to retain part or all of it this would insure that communities get the first opportunity to purchase and retain any asset that would be helpful to their development efforts i strongly support the en bloc amendments"], [0.00041496753692626953, 0.5004149675369263, 1, "mr chairman i regret that i must rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my good friend colleague and very important member of our public works and transportation committee the gentleman from tennessee fmr clement when the original provision was included in last years technical corrections legislation there was no controversy no objections were expressed by states adjoining the corridor or by members from those states now at the last moment an objection has been raised but no attempt has been made to reach a consensus on this issue for these reasons the leadership of the committee opposes the amendment the committee is willing to work with the gentleman and any other members who may have concerns regarding the routing of the indianapolis to houston high priority corridor ongoing feasibility studies for the corridor authorized by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1994 will provide another opportunity to address these concerns the federal highway administration is initiating a feasibility study of this corridor to be completed within 15 months a steering committee of all the corridor states and fhwa ho been established to guide the work f the contractor the study will encompass the entire corridor from indianapolis to houston and analyze a wide range of alternative locations and levels of improvements i believe concerns can be addressed through this process and i oppose this amendment"], [0.00045186281204223633,
