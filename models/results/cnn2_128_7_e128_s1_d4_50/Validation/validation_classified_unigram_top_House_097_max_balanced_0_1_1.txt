personal savings by all americans a brief history of the issue lndicatts the american willingness to save has substantially decreased over the last 10 years by the end of 1978 the rate of disposable income savings in the united states reached a 30year low of under 5 percentfar less than any other western democracy for example great britain has a 13percent savings rate west germany 15 percent and japan 25 percent each of these countries offers generous tax concessions or government bonuses to savers the importance of savings to productivity and our overall economy cannot be overstated onethird of all the capital in this country is made available through personal savings without adequate savings there cannot be sufficient investments in industry small business and home construction the result is higher consumer prices and increased unemploymnent last year recognizing this critical need to stimulate savings the congress enacted two measures that gradually raised the interest a person could receive on his or her savings deposits and allowed 200 400 for couplesof that interest to be taxfree for a 2year experimental period unfortunately while these two landmark laws represented a positive shift in unitedstates economic policy they have not resulted in any noticeable rise in personal savings interest rates on savings deposits have remained close to their original levels and as feared the 200 400 temporary interest tax exclusion does not seem to be enough of an incentive to save in fact studies show that an estimated 95 percent of all the money saved in america is earned by individuals and businesses whose interest and dividends income exceed the 200 400 limit earlier this year i introduced a bill h r 3049 to remedy this situation my legislation would make permanent the current 200 400 tax exclusion on interest and dividends and raise it to 1 000 2 000 for savings interest only in addition my bill would allow all persons age 65 and over to earn taxfree interest on their savings deposits the conablehance substitute offers similar relief aimed at providing a shortterm and much needed boost to our slumping savings and loan and thrift industry under the terms of this legislation depository institutions would be authorized to issue 1year taxexempt savings certificates they would allow single taxpayers to earn as much as 1 000 2 000 for couplesin taxfree interest the certificates which would cost 500 and above would yield 70 percent of the interest rate on 52week treasury bills and would be available for a 15month period beginning on october 1 the certificate would allow depository institutions to retain and attract many of the investment dollars that have recently gone to competing investment opportunities that currently offer higher returns i might add that these pavings certificates are far more prefprable than a proposal that has been offered to lower the returns on competing money market funds rather than penalizing the small saver by eliminating one of their few opportunities to get a fair market return on his or her dollar additional investment opportunities should be made available the taxexempt savings certificates provide such an opportunity as an original member of the house select aging committee i would like to emphasize however that these taxexempt savings certificates are not the final solution to our nations dismal savings rate especially as it relates to the elderly first the certificates would only be offered for a 15month period allowing the troubled depository institutions to revitalize thermselves over a 2year period but falling to provide any longterm relief for either the institutions or the saver second many senior citizens cannot afford to tie up 500 or more of their savings for a 1year period they depend heavily on their savings to pay for daily living expenses including emergency medical needs under the proposed certificate plan a person would receive stiff interest penalties for withdrawing funds early i favor a more flexible savings incentive plan that would incorporate the taxexempt savings certificate idea with the bill i authored providing acrosstheboard taxfree interest for senior citizens unfortunately i am restricted by the rule from offering such a compromise proposal in the form of an amendment as a result i am supporting the taxexempt certificate plan as the most responsible plan under these circumstances and another major step toward permanent and meaningful small saver relief we must not forget however that savings interest represents nearly 25 percent of the total income for persons age 65 and over in additions twothirds of all savings accounts in the united states belong to persons 5 years and older certainly then any longterm small savers relief should address the special needs of our elderly that is why i continue to offer my bill h r 3049 as an effective solution to the savings rate problem in our nation let me finally express my support for the additional savings incentive contained in the substituteincreased retirement investment opportunities under the conablehance amendment the current 1 500 limit on individual retirement account ira contributionrq would be increased to 2 000 2 250 for couples in addition for the first time employees contributing to an employersponsored pension plan could also claim the 2 000 2 250 ira tax deduction in addition the maximum tax deductible contributions to selfemployment keogh retirement plans would double from 7 500 to 15 000 both of these retirement savings in centives are expected to attract millions of new savings dollars while allowing individuals to plan for a more financially secure retirement simply stated increased savings by americans will do as much to stimulate our economy and increase productivity as any other economic tool the conablehance substitute provides responsible and effective tax incentives for savings and i urge that it be adopted today 9"],

corporation for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 this bill sets a funding level of 260 million for each year which represents a 25percent reduction from the corporations current funding the issue before us is fundamental to our national commitment to the principle of equal justice under the law congress has fulfilled that coinmitment to equal justice in part through creation and funding of the legal services corporation i strongly believe the legal needs of the poor cannot adequately be met without a strong national program such as the legal services corporation records show that the private bar and the states have been unable to meet these needs in a substantial way lawyers across the country routinely provide pro bono services not only to the poor but to nonprofit and charitable institutions as well these efforts however cannot be expected to meet the need for legal assistance if the corporation were abolished the administration has suggested that block grant funds to the states can be used to meet these needs they have recommended that none of the funds now provided for the legal services corporation be used in calculating the block grant allotment to the states this is in definite contrast to the 75 percent of current funding approach used for most social services programs and would be a clear signal to the states that this program has the lowest priority the states now provide only 1 percent of civic legal services funding nationally and there is little indication that they would be able to assume greater responsibility with so many states facing serious financial difficulties this is not the time to place on their shoulders the financial burden of providing legal services to the poor furthermore there is an inherent conflict in asking state or local govii1299 5 ernments to provide legal aid funds which are frequently used to force those same governments to comply with the law and provide services to which the poor are entitled while h r 3480 places a number of significant new restrictions on legal services programs some of which i do not favor and cuts 25 percent of the corporations present 321 million authorization the bill is a

we were not going to be taken in again by such unfounded charges of nazi brutality it was incredible unreal that this organized sort of murder should be taking place in the 20th century but why should

to thank our colleagues in the indiana congressional delegation for providing the members this opportunity to pay tribute to a fine man and a wonderful member of this body adam benjamin who passed away last week it was not only an honor to come to congress at the same time as adam but it was a pleasure to have him as a nextdoor neighbor on the fourth floor of the cannon house office building the point has been made on a number times already but i would like to stress again that a night did not go byor for that matter many weekendsthat adam benjamin was not in his office well into the evening and early mornings a show horse he was notbut most definitely a workhorse he was perhaps his physical stature did not match his personality of a warm and decent man who saw concerns and needs of people that had to be met and he worked tirelessly to improve their situations he served on the appropriations committee with great distinction and led its subcommittee on transportation with great skill but even more importantly i believe he was the driving force behind the congresssional steel caucus it was due to adams able leadership of the steel caucus that it became a power and positive

navigation subcommittee which would redistribute the money contained in title i of this bill for the coast guard first i would like to commend the appropriations committee for bringing this bill to the floor and for the support they have shown for the programs of the coast guard the coast guard traditionally has made great contributions to mar country in the areas of search and rescue law enforcement military preparedness drug interdiction merchant marine safety as well as the other needed responsibilities with which they are charged it seems that whenever the united states requires expertise in the maritime area it turns to the coast guard thus it is extremely important that we provide proper and adequate funding for these important programs as the representative from the state of alaska i have repeated over and over again that the services of the coast guard are extremely valuable and essential to that region however i submit that they are required throughout the entire maritime community and ultimately to the nation as a whole we in alaska need both effective fisheries law enforcement and search and rescue coverage to protect both the livelihood and lives of our people thus the safety of life and property at sea and security of our nation require that we approve the funding in this bill so that the coast guard can carry out these essential responsibilities and duties the amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts transfers 18 million from the retired pay account of the coast guard to other accounts where additional funding is needed the coast guard will still be able to meet all of its obligations to its retired personnel in the funds that remain in the retired pay account thus the reduced appropriation figure will not adversely affect those who have completed their long and valuable careers in the service of the coast guard what the amendment provides is 14 million in additional funds for operating expenses and 4 million iti adiditional funds for reserve training the operating expense money will be used to carry out the daytoday multimission functions of the coast guard in particular the funds are needed to restore budget cuts in short range aids to navigation programs and the recruiting and training programs further it is to adequately finance the maintenance of the coast guards vessels and airzraft and to continue activities such as the haitian migrant interdiction operation throughout fiscal year 1983 the reserve training funds will be used to train the coast guard reserve at the newly authorized level of 12 000 ready reservists thus these additional funds which are being transferred from the retired pay account are going to be redirected to important activities and functions that the coast guard performs

that i was fortunate enough to receive a government scholarship to continue my education back in my college days in those days we were smart enough to label everything under the sun defense so i got a scholarship to study russian government under what was called the national defense education act now i suspect if we could find a way to label it the national defense science education program and the national defense foreign langjiage program we could pass a whole lot of programs we cannot pass today betause we do not have a title which is quite as sexy in terms of public relations take medical schools i held hearings on the presidents budget all over my district last week a doctor come in and he said congressman why dont you admit that if you pass the presidents budget you are turning every medical school in this country into a rich kids school he said my mother was the first woman in vernon county to accept adc she got 12 a week whether she needed it or not and he said i had to work my way through college and work my way through medical school and i was lucky to have a wife who could help me with it but he said with the costs today there is no way that anybody from my background can afford to go to the university of wisconsin medical school or any other medical school you can name he said i guarantee you that you are pricing out average families out of dream of ever having their son or daughter become a doctor i do not think we need to do that in this budget teachers salaries in 1970 dollars teachers salaries today are 3 000 on average lower than they were in 1970 you wonder why we have trouble educating kids today you wonder why sat scores are dropping it is because some of the best minds in the country are no longer staying in education because it is not a good economic deal this budget makes it much more difficult to retain quality teachers in schools health care cost control health care as a percentage of our gnp is expected to be about 9 ~ to 10 percent this year it is predicted to be 17 percent of gnp by 1990 and the presidents budget cuts the three programs that have most to do with controlling health costs in this country it guts the psro program it guts the hmo program and it guts the program for the health planning agencies at the local level which prevent people from overbuilding on hospital construction and nursing home construction again i had people testify in those hearings in my district one community came to the local health planning agency and wanted to add 20 beds to their hospital the local health service planning agency worked with them and before they were finished they removed their request for a 2blbed increase they went to an outpatient prograin and they wound up later reducing their hospital capacity by 12 beds that saved a lot of money in that community the peer review system has helped make doctors more efficient it has helped reduce unneeded surgery and unneeded hospitalization it has helped doctors improve their treatment practices in states like mine it has helped save money it is being gutted in this budget these are just some of the decisions that will save pennies and cost dollars these mistakes can be rectified for very little money we can get that money from other areas that have been untouched i am out of time and will continue my analysis on monday"]]}
