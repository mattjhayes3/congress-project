care of the health care needs of the minorities the health care needs of the majority will certainly be under strain as it already is the 349 million the congressional black caucus has requested is targeted proportionately to african americans hispanics latinos asian pacific islanders and native american communities based on epidemiological data released by the center of disease control so the cbc is trying its very best to target the funds where the real need is these dollars will build upon the success of the 156 million requested for hiv aids prevention in minority communities in fiscal

americans and other minorities continue to suffer dramatically higher rates of disease and death longterm rates of illnesses from treatable diseases than other segments of the general population again i quote putting the money where the real need is so that it will overcome the disparities in our health system our nation spends over 7 billion for hiv treatment and prevention and control but listen to this mr speaker but only 156 million is specifically targeted to minority communities i repeat that we spend over 7 billion in this country for hiv treatment and prevention and control but only 156 million is specifically targeted to minority communities which now account for more than 48 percent of those infected by the disease that is a mere 2 percent of impact surely steps must be taken and effective measures must be put into place to ensure that resources follow the trend of the disease across all segments of the unitedstates population that is why my colleague the gentlewoman from the virgin islands called this special order mans inhumanity to man is basedon the color of ones skin is untrue mans inhumanity to man is not based on the color of ones skin and any kind of treatment in this country cannot ignore the fact that we are all in this situation together a minimum of 349 million should be appropriated in fiscal year 2000 to address this health emergency in communities of color this is a health emergency i want to thank the rest of my colleagues here but i want to end by saying we cannot continue to suffer these dramatic increases and this higher rate of mortality from death and disease and longterm rates of illnesses from diseases that are treatable these diseases are treatable and we cannot continue this disfunction different from other segments of the population as we prepare now our wonderful nation to enter the new millennium this negative health status must not continue must not continue and we cannot continue to ignore it mans inhumanity to man i spoke of

health and human services must begin to implement the recommendations stemming from the institution of medicines body of cancer studies in communities of color the office of minority health must be funded 5 million or more must be appropriated for demonstration projects to ensure that minority seniors understand how to navigate the complicated health system clearly clearly my colleagues in the

community initiatives i represent ohios l1th congressional district that consists of both urban and suburban areas creating areas all citizens can enjoy is important i believe we must not sacrifice our environment for expansion or destroy that which is already in place when we can utilize our spaces better i would like to discuss several programs and projects in my district that deal with making our communities livable the first program is in a small suburb of cleveland called woodmere village woodmere is a small predominantly african american community today the main thoroughfare in the village is chagrin boulevard a busy twolane road chagrin boulevard or kinsman road as it was originally known has long been a center for commerce with restaurants and stores places like ginos jewelry and trophy and tuscany gourmet foods are examples of businesses that draw people from all over the greater cleveland area it is really wonderful for the cleveland area to have such a vital route in it but a blessing can also create a burden chagrin boulevard daily has traffic of nearly 26 000 vehicles there are countless turnoffs from the street into private parking lots that cause traffic delays the lanes of traffic are wide often meaning that twolane road turns into a fourlane highway with drivers exceeding the posted 25 miles per hour limit people regularly drive simply to cross the street this traffic problem resulted in woodmere village applying for a grant from the transportation and community and system preservation pilot program this grant will provide money for studies to be done to best create livable solutions for chagrin boulevard i am happy to say that woodmere received a grant of 195 000 for the chagrin boulevard project the transportation and community systems preservation act was a provision in our tea21 legislation the surface transportation act of last year this program provides areas like woodmere funds to improve by considering alternative transportation projects rather than simply constructing a traditional bypass to look at what would happen if more time thought and resources were available to make a more comprehensive approach to the situation the plan in woodmere is not simply to create more lanes and widen the roadway as was originally recommended rather with some ingenuity the village is planning to create a true smalltown thoroughfare there will be treelined medians flanking the boulevard on both sides creating more pedestrianfriendly frontage roads new sidewalks crosswalks and traffic signals will be installed we must give people the option to leave their cars and walk to shops and restaurants chagrin boulevard would be safer for drivers accessible to people walking or wanting to ride a bike and better for those businesses along its routes should this proposed plan be accepted this is a perfect example of creating a livable space with what is already available i look forward to using the new chagrin boulevard because i travel it regularly as the gentleman from oregon the driving force behind many livable initiatives such as this said on the floor a week ago it is not about federal interference but partnership it is about giving people more choices rather than fewer and that will end up costing people less money rather than more i would also like to highlight parkworks this is a program working to reclaim urban parks in cleveland forest hills park a large park bordered by three municipalities one such area was rehabilitated by parkworks it is now a thriving area for children and families parkworks plans outdoor activities in these parks encouraging those of us living in cities to enjoy available natural resources parkworks has also worked with schools and churches in cleveland funding things like a new running track for a local high school and has planted 50 000 trees and created gardens for neighborhoods the money for improvements is donated from the lila wallace readers digest fund for the parks and through publicprivate partnerships for other projects i would like to commend the involvement of parkworks in making urban areas more livable by increasing green space and making that space available to the greater community they encourage a sense of partnership and camaraderie finally i would like to commend an organization in my district working for affordable housing the affordable housing tax credit coalition is awarding the cleveland housing network 5 000 for winning the tax credit excellence award in metropolitan urban category the cleveland housing network develops affordable housing in clevelands neighborhoods on a leasepurchase basis these affordable options serve families in poverty by providing home ownership opportunities participants in the program of the cleveland housing network will own their own homes within 15 years by promoting home ownership organizations like the cleveland housing network give poor citizens the ability to have a stake in the overall community this sort of program is also important to livable communities i commend the cleveland housing network without adequate housing we ostracize capable and interested

purchased on the internet we cannot allow our main street shops to operate at a competitive disadvantage to intemet sales as the internet continues to flourish congress must look at these issues and take careful appropriate action to level the playing field again i believe that all americans should have open access to the internet and for that reason i rise in support of this legislation"],

persecuting the muslims in china why if one reads todays washington times are we allowing the chinese government to increase its spying activities in the united states mr president if you really

moment ago stated the absolute fact this bill is within the caps according to the budget that passed this house period so let us not keep talking about we are doing all of this to save social security if the gentleman wants to save social security bring a social security bill to the floor and let us talk about social security if he wants to make points on the agricultural bill let us debate them we

legislation the gentleman is absolutely correct the idea that a fish or a shark could be caught and they have enough bad times the way it is but to take just the fins et cetera and return them to sea to die a very hideous death is beyond my comprehension whatever can happen sometimes these types of pieces of legislation can have good intentions and they are not implemented by thestate department because we have to recognize we have a lot of rules about how one sees interception now with our salmon in alaska and yet we have documentation where the coast guard has identified the death curtains at high seas and the coast guard tries to implement and enforce our international agreement and the state department tries to pull them off and say we do not want an international incident i will say again i voted against trading with china and i will say again the chinese government is the guiltiest one of all of catching these fish at high seas with these huge long nets until the state department sees fit to enforce those type of laws these sound good and feel good on the floor of the house but we have to have someone with a little backbone and an administration that will say all right this is the law this is an agreement we reached and enforce those laws so that we can stop the heinoustype action with shark finning and of course with catching the fish at high seas i urge
