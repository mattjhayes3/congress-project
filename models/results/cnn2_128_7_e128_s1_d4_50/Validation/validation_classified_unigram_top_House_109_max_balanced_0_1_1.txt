mr bill delahunt i am so glad mr delahunt is here we were talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the

disrupted their abilities to plan and direct major operations radical islamic networks have spread and decentralized we poured gasoline on a fire when we went into iraq and we need to make that point many of the new cells the nie conclude have no connection to any central structure and arose independently the members of the cells communicate only among themselves and derive their inspiration ideology and tactics from the more than 5 000 radical islamic web sites they spread the message that the war in iraq is a western attempt to conquer islam by first occupying iraq and establishing a permanent presence in the middle east what we have to realize here and i think what the president needs to realize and the lack of oversight by the republican congress what we need to realize here is that it is not our view that matters it is what do they think how do they see our response if average people in the middle east see us as being detrimental to their interest their ideology spreads so

that i have worked for for more than a decade to put the provision in there also there are some provisions on nuclear energy and i know that is sort of a controversial thing but i for one believe if we are going to start worrying on dependency on foreign oil that if we are really concerned about global climate change and climate change here in this country we must revisit the issue of nuclear energy and i am pleased this bill provides incentives to make the united states once again a leader in this area and protect our environment protect our climate and get america less dependent on foreign oil as i said this is not a perfect bill but is one that i can support after 13 years and seeing so many energy bills come before this floor none of which i have supported i am pleased to be able to lend my support for this bill and once again i would like to thank the leadership for their work on this legislation i think what we have before us today is a pretty good energy bill the conferees worked hard to craft compromise legislation that i think the majority of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support today is this a perfect bill no i would have preferred to see some of the corporate tax breaks pared back but the energy and commerce conferees were shut out of discussions regarding tax provisions in addition i would like to have seen stronger measures to give direct relief at the pump for the millions of americans who are paying record high prices for gasoline right now i had a measure that would have provided millions of additional barrels of oil for the unitedstates market by suspending contributions to the strategic petroleum reserve until the price of oil dips below 40 per barrel for two consecutive weeks unfortunately that was dropped in exchange for language allowing the secretary of energy to voluntarily suspend contributions if he sees fit i would like to take this time to suggest that he do so immediately allowing more oil into the domestic market i also would have liked to have seen stronger wording for secondary containment of underground storage tanks while we did make some improvements on this issue we can ill afford to allow our groundwater to become contaminated with gasoline from leaking underground storage tanks in particular we cannot allow mtbe to continue to contaminate drinking water across the country i am happy that the safe harbor provisions for manufacturers of mtbe that were in the house bill were dropped instead there is a provision allowing lawsuits to be sent to federal court if a defendant wants to make a request to do so during the conference i asked chairman barton about the mtbe provisions in the bill and whether the claims filed after the date of enactment would require a case to be sent to federal court the chairman indicated that it did not require a case to be sent to federal court but gave defendants in prospective suits the right to ask that the case be sent to federal courts i wanted to be sure that we were not conferring any new substantive or subject matter jurisdiction over mtbe cases and i was pleased to hear from chairman barton that to his knowledge the legislation was not doing so i am happy to see that there are provisions in the bill to increase incentives for the nuclear power industry while i know that there are those who oppose nuclear energy i feel that if we are going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and climate change we need to explore increased nuclear technologies a provision i am particularly proud to say made it into the conference is a ban on any new oil and gas drilling beneath our great lakes this provision will improve public safety and protect the source of drinking water for more than 30 million residents of the great lakes ive worked on this for more than a decade and this will benefit the people of the great lakes for generations to come lastly i am happy to report that this bill does not include drilling for oil and gas in the arctic national wildlife refuge this is not a perfect bill but it is one that i can support and i thank chairman barton and ranking member dingell for their tireless efforts to come to the compromise before us today"], [0.00022688508033752441, 0.4997731149196625, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i want to thank the gentleman from washington for yielding me the customary 30

authorization act the rule waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration and provides that the conference report shall be considered as read i rise in support of the rule for h r 5122 and the underlying legislation today we are at a critical juncture the conference report for the fiscal year 2007 national defense authorization act is before us this legislative companion to the fiscal year 2007 defense appropriations bill authorizes and provides critical legislative language for full implementation of our defense policies let us be clear this is an excellent piece of legislation a good bipartisan package that represents the best work of the house armed services committee recognizing that i would like to personally thank both the gentleman from california chairman hunter and the gentleman from missouri ranking member skelton for deliv ering a package that i am sure almost all of us can support having served on the house armed services committee and currently being a member on leave of absence from that committee i know how closely the members of that committee work together to achieve a bill that is bipartisan that is good for our servicemen and women and that is good for increasing the security of our country this year the armed services committee produced a bill that contains several major legislative initiatives and funding impacts among them are an additional 70 billion in supplemental bridge funding to support the war on terrors operations costs personnel expenses and procurement of new equipment additional funding for force protection needs in support of operation enduring freedom and operation iraqi freedom including uparmored humvees humvee ied protection kits and gunner protection kits ied jammers and stateoftheart body armor a 2 2 percent pay raise for all members of our armed forces and an increase of 30 000 personnel for the army and 5 000 personnel for the marine corps to help them sustain theirrequired missions the bill blocks the department of defense proposed tricare prime standard and select reserve fee increases the bill authorizes grants and loan guarantees to unitedstates shipyards to approve their efficiency cost effectiveness and international competitiveness the bill fully funds the immediate army and marine corps shortfalls for replenishing supplies and replacing equipment in the amount of 17 1 billioh for the army and 5 7 billion for the marines more importantly this legislation directly supports our servicemen and women in the field and on deployment operations in iraq and afghanistan are dependent on us passing this legislation that contains so many changes in legislative language a bumper sticker we often read says i support our troops today we have that opportunity and responsibility we could support our troops and improve the security of our nation in a way that other americans cannot we can offer our vote in support of this legislation as 60 of 61 members of the house armed services committee did when they initially passed the bill this is not a controversial proposition this is something we should be proud to do regardless of our perspectives and different positions on the war in iraq all of us are proud of our troops all of us are committed to them and commend them for their courage and their professionalism and all of us will do everything we can to increase their safety and effectiveness i would be remiss if i did not also note that the afghan and the iraqi people also deserve to be commended for their efforts in our common struggle during this war the citizens of both these countries have held elections written constitutions and formed permanent governments afghan and iraqi citizens are watching what we do here today they require and request our continued support as they move forward in their efforts to build new and better countries the passage of this rule and underlying legislation is an important sign that this country and congress will keep its commitments afghanistan and iraq are striving to create a future of hope and promise we can play an important role in helping them do that here today many may wish to raise policy issues in this debate some may want to discuss issues that however important are superfluous to providing for the needs of our men and women in uniform and i welcome that exchange if indeed it occurs i believe we should focu on what should count we have committed hundreds of thousands of our service men and women to fight terrorism and advance the cause of freedom in iraq and afghanistan we owe them our full support in the battles they wage on behalf of the american people and the cause of liberty this rule and the underlying bill represent the efforts of congress to keep that solemn commitment to the sons and daughters of america to that end i urge support for the rule and the underlying bill i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00032585859298706055,
