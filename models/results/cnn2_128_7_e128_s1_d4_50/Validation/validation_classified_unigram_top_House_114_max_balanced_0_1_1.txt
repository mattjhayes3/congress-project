who believe the exim bank is about economic development and trade and those who believe it is about corporate welfare cronyism and an unfair economy for those who claim that the exim bank creates jobs

have said they have lost jobs when the exim bank subsidizes air india valero refining in my native texas has said they lose jobs in america when the exim bank will subsidize a turkish competitor cliffs natural resources of cleveland ohio will say they lose jobs when the exim bank subsidizes an australian competitor which has caused economist donald boudreaux to say at best the exim bank creates jobs in export industries by destroying jobs in nonexport industries how is that fair how is that fair mr speaker we are told that the exim bank makes money for the taxpayers well yes if you use special insider washington accounting rules but if you use fair value accounting something that the rest of america has to use the congressional budget office says that it actually loses money and in fact it has received an actual bailout from the federal taxpayers before we are told they help small business and you know what that is true in a number of cases but yet twothirds of the benefits go to fortune 50 companies like boeing like ge they are great companies with great people doing great things i just wonder why they have to receive taxpayer subsidies and 40 percent goes to benefit one company boeing that is why it is affectionately called the bank of boeing so i know it helps some small businesses but other small businesses arent too fond of the exim bank we hear from the chairman of michael lewis company in mccook illinois over the long run exim subsidies for foreign carriers creates a tilted playing field that means fewer unitedstates airlines jobswhich translates into economic pain for thousands of businesses like ours and our employees that is the voice of small business chris rufer founder of the morning star company when a company profits from the banks support it pockets the money if it defaults taxpayers pockets gets picked it is private gain at the expense of public pain that too is the voice of small business we are told that as long as global competitors do this well we have to do it i mean that is an argument i hear from my children everybody else is doing it so we have to do it but the truth is almost twothirds of the exim bank book has nothing to do with a countervailing duty and almost 99 percent of all unitedstates exports are financed without the exim bank so we need to help our exporters we need to help our small businesses but the way we do that is through expanded trade it is through fundamental tax reform that the national association of manufacturers has said is 50 percent of our competitive disadvantage lets make a fairer flatter simpler tax code lets have regulatory reform with the reins act lets pass the keystone pipeline and drive energy prices down and become more competitive that way so the arguments of those who propose to support the exim bankand these are good people and i know they believe in their hearts and heads in what they are doing but i dont think their arguments bear scrutiny they dont stand up to the light of day because the true face of the exim bank is about cronyism it is about misplaced priorities it is about foreign aid it is about corruption again this is a bank that benefits a handful of fortune 50 companies that lobby and lobby well now i would defend their first amendment right to do it i just wish they would lobby for more competition and more freedom and not subsidy and special privilege we know that so much of this support ends up in countries like china and russia we asked the chairman of the exportimport bank so we are supposed to compete with china by subsidizing china and you know what his answer was well it is complicated no it is not complicated it is stupid it is stupid for us to subsidize china in the thought that somehow we are going to compete with china almost 1 billion to the democratic republic of the congo which freedom house says is the third worst human rights offender in the world the cronyism money to solyndra money to enron

company how cozy the fannie and freddie business model corruption the last 6 years 75 years total prison time 90 criminal indictments 49 criminal judgments one employee just recently pleaded guilty to

work and how hard you work on main street not who you know in washington crony capitalism is a threat to our free enterprise system this is america if you dream big dreams if you play by the rules you can make it on main street but not in this washington insider economy and there is no better poster child of the washington crony economy and corporate welfare than the exportimport bank so i have no doubt that an overwhelming number of democrats are going to support the reauthorization of the exportimport bank they are always happy to allocate credit and our economy as part of a political process

it is the free enterprise system which is moral it is the free enterprise system which is based on merit it is the free enterprise system which is empowering to people it is the only economic system

threats in our country we work continuously to look back at the 9111 commission recommendations to make sure that we are fulfilling all of the areas of trouble that were identified by that commission where we can make ourselves more secure from terrorist threats we also worked very hard as a committee looking at the boston marathon bombing we worked on that and found out that information sharing was not as great as it should have been in fact it was one of the things that could have prevented that from occurring the police commissioner of boston testified in front of the committee and was asked did you know the information that the federal law enforcement officials had his answer was no then he was asked would it have been helpful for you to know that and he said of course yet that information wasnt available we have worked in the committee to make sure that information is shared at the local regional county and state levels as well as the federal law enforcement agency communities we have worked together successfully with groups like the joint terrorism task force to make sure that information is shared on a daily basis on a weekly basis and in a policy sense even on a monthly basis looking back and making sure that we have a seamless system we had an initiative that i joined with my colleague from georgia on as well as four other members of this house where we traveled to look at the issue of foreign terrorist fighters and the threat to our country resulting from their actions sadly in the united states there are over 200 people who have been identified as leaving this country to fight for isil in syria and iraq yet we went through not only the middle east but through europe with our allies there to see what threats were there in terms of using those countries as portals into the united states making sure that not only the 200plus people from the unitedstates if they came back would be able to deal with their threats but also the threats imposed by other countries coming back to the unitedstates we found out that in istanbul for instance at the airport there there are 61 million flights in that airport alone that is probably 11 times roughly the whole population of my state of massachusetts think of that we found out that there wasnt security measures in place there that we take for granted in our own country we also worked hard with our allies in europe so that they would do the basics and have passenger name records there so that we could trade information to find out who is boarding these planes we are glad to report that the european union has acted on that and that has been closed they are working on areas with the exterior borders that we talked to them about in our trip we also have been successful as a congress to work on the visa waiver country issue to make sure that those areas where people are coming back and have traveled to syria and iraq are vetted the way they should be vetted we also realize that not only do we have to fight this war on multiple fronts but we know that back home the threat of domestic violent extremists remains the number one threat according to every expert we know from the work that we have done collectively that we could do more on that front in preventing it we were told about fusion centers which are tremendous assets to our security at the local state or federal level where we worked together gathering and compiling information on a realtime basis yet those fusion centers and the employees there wanted to do more they were telling us how they could do more if they were given more training more coordination and more information to deal with at the local and state level it would create a great multiplier effect with the frontline law enforcement people that would make our country safer along those lines the gentleman from georgia put in legislation that i am proud to be a lead sponsor on to make sure that the department of homeland security is there

in this legislation which differs in a significant way from the definition of stem that chairman smith proposed in last years version of this same bill specifically the current version would define stem as science technology engineering and mathematics including computer science last years version developed in collaboration with the stem education coalition read as science technology engineering and mathematics including other academic subjects that build on these disciplines such as computer science this second definition the one this entire house agreed to last year was agreed to because it left the door open for other critical fields such as statistics and geology that dont cleanly fit into s t e or m of stem in k12 teacher certifications and curricula i think we can all agree to the importance of computer science education the current disconnect between the high demand for information technology jobs and limited opportunities for students to be exposed to computer science at the k12 level puts american students and american companies at a significant disadvantage however it baffles me as to why we would implicitly devalue such fields as statistics and geology in order to highlight computer science statistics is an essential tool across all fields of science without good statistics the biomedical research results that we count on to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics for diseases would be meaningless without geology oil and gas companies would not be able to locate and drill for new sources of energy without geology we will never achieve early warning

matter how you feel about big game hunting the real reason elephants and other iconic animals are being wiped out is far more sinister and it is why this issue deserves the attention of congress and the administration those responsible for poaching are profiting from their crimes by selling ivory or rhinoceros horns or cheetah pelts where do these profits go these profits go to buy weapons for violent armed militias to bribe government officials and law enforcement and to fuel criminal networks in short poaching pumps resources into groups that threaten security and stability groups that want to do harm to innocent people and want to do harm to the united states of america that is why chairman royce and i view wildlife trafficking as a security issue and that is why we introduced the

outside of the census bureau on april 9 just a few weeks before that prince georges county police officer brennan rabain was killed in an automobile accident on march 7 just prior to that in january a police officer from baltimore craig chandler was also killed in a vehicle accident a canine bella from the maryland division of correction in maryland was killed in a fire incident also just a few weeks ago it is a stark reminder of the jeopardy that officers place themselves in and a reminder of what they do every single day to protect each and every one of us i have such a deep admiration and appreciation for the fallen officers who will be honored on may 15 and the ultimate sacrifices they have made on behalf of all of our local communities i urge members to join me in supporting this tribute to our law enforcement officers across the country who died in the line of duty in 2014 i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0008216500282287598, 0.5008216500282288, 1, "i respect my

leadership on this legislation i also want to thank the gentleman from virginia for his support most importantly i want to thank my friend the gentleman from tennessee for giving me the opportunity to coauthor this piece of legislation with him emerging growth companies that raise capital from private investors have two options available to them to give their investors a return the first option is to take the company public and the second option is to sell the business the data overwhelmingly suggests that when companies go public the companies are very likely to take the capital they raise in a public offering invest it in the business create jobs and hire americans as compared to when companies are sold which are often done for strategic reasons that are based on consolidations and often result in jobs being lost so while companies are completely free to make whatever choices they want to make we as policymakers should certainly be trying to level the playing field as it relates to initial public offerings in order to make them more accessible for emerging growth companies particularly if they can be done without compromising investor protection i believe strongly that h r 2064 does in fact do that my colleague from tennessee went through the specifics in terms of the processes that are being improved by the bill i have some firsthand experience with this process in having started two businesses in the private sector and in having taken them both public on the new york stock exchange experiences that taught me that a companys initial public offering as it relates to due diligence and scrutiny and oversight is the day when they have the most focus by regulators and investors and underwriters so it is certainly a time where we have an opportunity for more flexibility around timing which i believe this bill does and will do successfully it will lead to more initial public offerings it will hopefully reverse the trends that we have seen across the last several decades where the number of initial public offerings have decreased as i said in my opening comments the more ipos we have the more likely companies are to invest in their businesses create jobs and hire americans it is good for our economy i urge my colleagues to support h r 2064"]]}
