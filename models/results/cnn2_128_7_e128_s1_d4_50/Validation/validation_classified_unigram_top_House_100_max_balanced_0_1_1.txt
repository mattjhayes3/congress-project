two years ago after a long delay this congress over the presidents veto passed a trade sanctions bill and a disinvestment bill the president as most presidents do when they have a problem appointed a commission that commission studied the whole question of whether constructive appeasementi guess i might as well call it appeasement because that is what it iswas a path to follow or whether confrontation on a unified basis was the path to follow that commission his commission brought in the recommendation that outside intervention was the only way to bring about an end to apartheid that real hard hitting at the government of south africa and at the people of south africa was the only way to bring about a solution and what did the president do he just ignored the commissions and the congress recommendation despite the fact that he had vetoed the bill and the congress had by twothirds vote overridden his veto just recently all of the nations of the former british empire met in toronto they considered this subject and studied this subject and what did they recommend they recommended outside intervention not continued appeasement appeasement has gone too far appeasement has gotten this country and this world ir terrible shape once before in the 1030s the same debate that we are having today echos the same words spoken then between those who would intervene and those who would appease unfortunately the japanese decided that question for us on december 7 and we intervened but we appeased for a long time we appeased in spain we appeased in europe we appeased in japan we got an awful lot of casualties out of that appeasement and the world got millions of casualties out of it let us go back to how tough this bill is here is what this bill will do when it becomes law it says mr president youve got 6 months to go out and negotiate with the other industrialized nations of the world and get an agreement out of them that they will impose sanctions as strict as ours and

industrialized countries to go ahead with an embargo like ours he is required not permittedhe has had 2 years of permissiveness and appeasement and he has done nothingbut this bill requires him to take action against those countries who have exploited our embargo by that i mean the asian countries japan taiwan and the others and i mean the european community i will name them all if my

trade from the date of enactment of this bill but trade since 1986 my colleagues know what those countries are going to do they do not want to give up the unitedstates market they are going to come

the secretary of defense to delegate the implementation of the commercial activities or contracting out program to base or installation commanders my amendment would further require that regulations for this delegation be issued with 60 days after the enactment of this act although i strongly support this delegation of authority over the commercial acitivities program to base commanders i cant take credit for this idea like the core logistics concept enacted 3 years ago this delegation idea is a pentagon initiative late last year or early this year the deputy assistant secretary of defense installations proposed a new draft instruction on the implementation of the commercial activities program that is carried out in accordance with office of management and budget circular a76 the most significant change in this instruction was the delegation of program implementation to the base commander the primary reason for this change was to bring the commercial activities program in line with the model installation program the model installation program was established 3 years ago and has been highly successful in identifying and removing regulations and procedures that impair management and productivity at those installations as a result base commanders at those installations have been given wide latitude to exercise initiative in developing new and innovative management techniques to date base commanders have been allowed to waive over 20 000 regulations and devised many new ways to improve and streamline their operations the lessons learned in this test program are being studied and applied across the board as part of a new graduate program needless to say this program has been extremely popular in the field and shows great promise in producing even greater savings and efficiencies in the coming year in effect dod has finally discovered a fundamental management principle that business and many in congress haveknown all along you select the best people you can to command you give them as much latitude as you can over methods and the application of resources to perform the mission and you hold them accountable the new draft instruction merely applies this philosophy to the implementation of the commercial activities or contracting out program instead of being forced down his throat irrespective of its impact on the base or its mission the commercial activities program becomes another useful management tool that the base commander can selectively use to realize efficiencies and economies by the same token however this change does not mean that base commanders can ignore the commercial activities program the base commander must still identify functions eligible for review cost comparisons and must maintain the inventory of such functions furthermore the funding crunch in the coming years will force base commanders to aggressively explore all means to cut costs and improve work force productivity just because using the commercial activities program will be a hard choice for many base commanders does not mean that it should not be employed when it makes sense to do so base commanders are being paid to make hard choices and they remain accountable for carrying out their missions as cost effectively as possible nevertheless this delegation provides a significant increase in management flexibility over the years i have had many discussions with base commanders and i know of no other single program that has caused them more concern and difficulty than the commercial activities program all too often higher headquarters have dictated the pace and scope of cost comparisons to meet some arbitrary pentagon deadlines if the function was contracted out and contractor performance was not satisfactory that was the base commanders problem if contractor performance cost more than was projected that was the base commanders problem if contract conversion lowered productivity and efficiency that was the base commanders problem if mission performance suffers that is the base commanders problem i believe that if we are going to hold the base commander responsible for the problems associated with contracting out through the commercial activities program we should give him more control over the implementation of that program that is precisely what the new instruction would do my amendment helps this process along and insures that we have a commercial activities program that is consistent with the new management flexibility being given to base commanders i urge your support of my amendment"],

sailors airmen and marines in spite of the budget cuts made in the grammrudmanhollings legislation dan managed to see that our need for readiness in personnel in construction and in weapons was not

portions of the beach at wakiki the r d hotel for veterans and retirees at fort derusy dan vowed to see that this last bit of oalus beach was reserved as it was intended to be for rest and recreation

colleague from illinois it is nothing personal it is a matter of public policy and time has passed one of the things that struck me which is sort of difficult in life is that you can never find a free market guy when you really need one i mean i thought we had in this house a lot of devotees of the principle of the market and free enterprise and i naively assumed that one basic manifestation of that principle was that a private enterprise had to pay its own way i i had also assumed that the cost of insurance was part of the cost of doing business lo and beholdin that orderwe have some of the most ardent free enterprisers in the house announcing that somewhere in adam smith or milton friedman or friedrich hayek or ludwig von mises and the names get harder for me to pronounce there is a footnote that says except the atomic energy industry because what we are talking about here is a very simple principle should an industry which may not deliberately impose a cost on society be forced to bear that cost people will say well that will go through to the consumer yes that is it good free economics if that is what happens it is as with hazardous waste the way you deal in a free market systemand i had not expected to be the one giving this lecture to my friends on the other side but you do what you have to in this lifeunder the free market system when an entity imposes costs on a society the rational way to deal with that is to say to the people who are buying that product you must bear the cost that is the free market way what you have now is a subsidy by regulation which disguises the cost which subsidizes nuclear power by exempting it from free market principles what you want to do is to say a part of the cost of having nuclear power is the need to rationally insure against accidents and if you exempt people from that you are interfering with the working of the free market system so let us not abandon the free market principles"], [0.0002866387367248535,

the 40th anniversary of the creation of the genocide treaty which was adopted unanimously by the u n general assembly in 1948 not surprisingly the united states was the first country to sign the treaty on december 11 1948 2 days after it was adopted it was transmitted to the senate soon afterward seeking ratification however the senate did not ratify the treaty until 1986 in the 99th congress the final step in the process of the unitedstates ratification of this treaty is the legislation before us today to implement this treaty and make it part of our own unitedstates criminal law the genocide treaty was an outgrowth of the holocaust trauma that occurred during world war ii the convention was designed to place all of the nations of the world on record in opposition of the crime of genocide in hopes of preventing future tragedies by ratifying the convention and implementing the treaty into our own laws the united states joins the community of nations pledging to forever ban genocide this legislation has two nurposes first to codify the international law respecting the crime of genocide and second to list the punishment for acts of genocide in essence this legislation makes an offense with its specific intent to destroy in whole or in substantial part a national ethnic racial or religious group first to kill a member of the group second to cause serious bodily injury to a member third to cause the permanent impairment of the mental facilities of a member fourth to subject the group to conditions of life that are intended to cause a physical destruction of the group or fifth to impose measures intended to prevent birth within that group or to transfer by force a child of the group to another group the bill also prohibits the attempt and the direct or public incitement to commit any of these offenses this legislation is strongly supported by both the department of state and the department of justice i might add that there were some reservations prior to the ratification or passage by the senate with respect to the treaty visavis our own constitution i might add that those problems were worked out before ratification so in no way does the passage of this treaty in any way subjugate the rights of individual americans to their constitutional rights as guaranteed under our constitution 97 other countries ineluding every major power and
