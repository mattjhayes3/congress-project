to cut out these middle extortionists i call them people in the middle that are trading on that squalor and that exploitation also to say that one of the greatestreligious leaders i ever met said

within our own family but the kind of society and country we create we will be judged on many levels and i think these trade agreements are as you said immoral because those who are the least among us are hurt the most i think of norma mcfadden from dixon ticonderoga in sandusky ohio who worked there her whole life and was about my age and then was told you get a pink slip even though the company was profitable and moved to mexico what happened to norma what happened to norma was she could not afford health benefits because under the federal program cobra it costs about 800 a month well she lost her job she could not afford the 800 for cobra so at 55 58 years of age she went back to school to become a phlebotomist to learn how to take blood and she had to drive to work in her old ramshackle car to try to go to school and ultimately tried to get a job at a hospital as a receptionist and just trying to tread water there in the years when really she should have some peace of mind because she has been a working woman her whole life she has raised her family so to me these trade agreements are some of the most antilife measures that i have ever seen they hurt people all over our

crafting a compromise piece of legislation in a manner where no one is unfairly impacted we are providing economic stability for custer county we are securing roads and trails for todays motorized

to reauthorize it in the end we had to ask ourselves after hearing the testimony of the attorney general why did we do this why are we so specific and so careful about the powers that we give to the executive when they can simply ignore it and go on their own it simply begs the question if you are not going to use fisa why not just runamuck i submit that the acid test for republicans on this has to be would we be comfortable if a democrat were in the white house using this authority i have to say i wouldnt be but nor am i comfortable with a member of my own party having it there is a
