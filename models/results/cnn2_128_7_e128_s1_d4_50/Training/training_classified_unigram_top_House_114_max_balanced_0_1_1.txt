and policy proposals members of congress have been trying to keep up now republicans in the house not only have to play to the small but extremely vocal segment of the electorate that feels washington is out of step with the american people but they have another audience to wooeach otherbecause a lot of our colleagues are currently running for leadership positions but is it really washington that is out of step with america or is it the most vocal most active and most vitriolic elements of the republican base that are out of step with america last weeks nbc news wall street journal poll was pretty startling it shows in issue after issue that on the positions adopted by the leading gop candidates vast majorities of americans disagree with republicans on abortion restrictions immigration lgbt equality racial diversity and reproductive health some in the republican base demand we go back to the dark ages but it is not in fact the direction that most americans want to go for most americans mad men was a good tv drama set before racial integration before the womens movement really took hold before gays and lesbians dared come out of the closet and before we removed racial quotas from immigration but some in the republican party aspire to turn it into a reality tv show the latest throwdown from the right has been over planned parenthood and reimbursing this respected organization for health services it provides to women across the country in many cases planned parenthood is the only source of affordable and accessible reproductive health care contraception hiv and std testing cancer screenings and basic health care for women under federal law our tax dollars cannot pay for abortions and there are no credible claims that this is being violated under law abortion is legal in the united states despite all of the restrictions imposed and proposed by my republican colleagues but this goes further than abortion rights and a womans right to control her own health care and reproduction some americans here and around the country are frankly not too comfortable with the whole family planning thing in my family i have two daughters who are brilliant and whom i trust to make decisions for themselves they were born 8 years apart and not by accident my wife and i planned her pregnancies around her career as an investment banker and had our children when we were ready that is an option that opened the world of opportunity and selfdetermination to my wife that my mother never had puerto rican women in this country in my mothers day had one thing forced on them by the government and that was sterilization period so when i hear talk about shutting down the government to appease the far right on planned parenthood i think of the progress we have made from my mothers generation to my wifes generation and now to the world in which my daughters live it seems to me that we should not be looking for ways to limit choices women have to force them into back alleys or across state lines for health care or to treat them as if only wise men in washington can make decisions for the women of america but that desire to turn the clock backwards to undo the progress of our lifetimes and to punish america for evolving over time is basically at the heart of the republican agenda as driven by their most active and vocal base republicans run for office and legislate as if they want gay people back in the closet as if they want latinos and asians to become invisible as if they wish women were just in the kitchen or in the bedroom as if we could go back to those golden days before the civil rights act the voting rights act brown v board of education when everything was separate and some people were more equal than others well with all due respect to mr carson and emperor trump every poll indicates that the american people are not with them and that is especially true of young people in america dr carson must be nostalgic for the anticatholic days before john kennedy was elected because he is now raising doubts that people of certain religions are qualified to serve their country as president senator cruz must look at the old days when we turned away refugees from europe because of their religion as we did in the 1930s and 1940s when antisemitism gripped this country now he wants to send muslims back to die in syria and now there is donald trump he wants to deport about a quarter of the 50 million latinos in the united states if mass deportation was good enough for president eisenhower he feels it should be good enough for america today i will agree with one leading candidate jeb bush who recently said that stuff happens stuff does happen a lot of stuff has happened since the 1950s when i was born and the 1960s when i grew up in america our laws and our culture have evolved to become more inclusive and we have a more diverse and egalitarian society because of it many republicans call that stuff the problem i call
