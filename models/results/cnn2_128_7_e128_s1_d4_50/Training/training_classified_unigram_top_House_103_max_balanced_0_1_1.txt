all the way back when president clinton came to capitol hill and made his state of the union speech and said if you dont like my program please give me your specifics we just listened to the distinguished chairman of the budget committee who the tax foundation argues there will be 732 jobs killed in his district in my district it will be 1 239 jobs that will be lost as a result of the tax and spend program of the administration president clinton came here and he said if you dont like my taxes if you dont like my tax and spend policy give me your specific recommendations to reduce spending and of course we developed them we went to the budget committee and we said to the budget committee we want to cut spending first and reduce the jobkilling taxes the jobkilling bureaucrats who will create regulation that will further slow down this economy we went to the budget committee and we offered a substitute that was more specific than your substitute we said that we wanted to cut spending first we offered a full substitute you rejected it on pax ty line votes then we came through 10 hours worth of amendments where we tried to substitute specific spending cuts in exchange for the jobkilling tax increases that you have in your bill and you defeated us hour after hour on a partyline vote we were the subject of gridlock and the american people are going to be subject to unemployment because of this tax and spend policy that the president and the majority is inflicting on us today then we go to reconciliation and we are told develop 345 billion in cuts if you want to offset our tax increases by the way their tax and spending cuts 4 in taxes to every dollar in spending cuts then we go into reconciliation into the markup yesterday morning and the rules committee we go in with 352 billion in deficit reduction with no tax increases and you folks have to meet at 2 oclock in the morning behind closed doors to figure out how to change the rules after we beat you then also you see every time you set a standard we meet it every time you say tax and spend we have to tax and spend and we give you specific spending cuts that shrinks the size of government and reforms the bureaucracy in the united states every time we give you the specifics to meet the goal you set you change the rules and do you want to know why because you cannot resist anything but tax and spend

gridlock the republicans and why do we want to shrink the government why do we want to cut the spending why do we want to eliminate the taxes because your economic program is a job killer your tax increases on the energy in this country will affect people from the automobile to the schoolhouse to the grocery shelves your energy tax is going to put people out of work your social security tax is abominable when you promised people a tax cut you turn around after the election not even 6 months after the election and you raise their taxes well do you know what the republicans want to do we want to cut spending first we want to downsize the government because we believe the answer lies in the individual in this country with more incentives and less government and less jobkilling regulation

253 to 162 and preceded an attempt to introduce a privileged motion calling for an independent investfgation of the house post office following the adoption of this resolution a sixmember task force was created to conduct the investigation it was composed of three democrats and three republicans on april 9 the house approved house resolution 430 reaffirming the need for a house post office investigation and condemning any interference in its progress this followed a privileged motion requiring the chairman and the vice chairman to report to the house and explain actions on the part of staff to suspend the investigation on may 28 1992 the house approved a request by chairman ross and vice chairman roberts that the task force be given until july 6 to conduct the remaining interviews and file its reports then on or about july 22 1992 the house administration committee task force again made up equally between democrats and republicans reported on its investigation of the operation and management of the office of the postmaster and at the time the house passed the resolution directing the house administration committee to send the report and all of the records obtained in the investigation to the justice department which was then headed by a republican attorney general and obviously a republican president in the white house at that time and to the house ethics committee
