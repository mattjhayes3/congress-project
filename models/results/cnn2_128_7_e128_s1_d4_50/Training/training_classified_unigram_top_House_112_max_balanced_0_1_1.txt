highlighted in pink and in red have the most food hardships while the districts in yellow are not far behind districts highlighted in blue have the lowest food hardship but the national average is that nearly one in five americans struggles with food hardship simply put they are at risk of going hungry according to a study done by the center for budget policy and priorities the republican budget composed by chairman paul ryan and endorsed by presidential candidate mitt romney would impose extraordinary cuts in programs that serve as a lifeline for our nations poorest and our most vulnerable citizens not the least of these are americas critical antihunger initiatives like food stamps and the women infants and children or wic program all of which the ryan republican budget threatens to slash by as much as 19 percent that means for example that over 8 million men women and children could be cut from food stamps and 21 2 million pregnant and postpartum women infants and children may be slashed from the wic program the ryan budget slashes these antihunger initiatives while preserving subsidies for big oil tax breaks for the wealthiest americans it is a reverse robin

executive order to review the regulations we have in place this is a unique opportunity to reframe at least part of the regulatory debate to satisfy both sides and better serve the public the area of opportunity lies in creating a new generation of environmental protections that are performance based pioneering efforts to protect the environment like the clean air act and the clean water act were regulatory based that worked well for their time public health requirements citizen expectations have evolved subsequent efforts have become more difficult expensive and time consuming having these agencies dictate specifics is not necessarily providing the most innovative timely nor costeffective solutions there is an alternative to rulesbased procedures commandandcontrol rules process such a model would give latitude to parties on how they comply with the standards for protection as long as they met or exceeded the requirement in oregon we were able some years ago in partnership with the epa and the state department of environmental quality to work with a major industrial presence in our community intel on a plant expansion where latitude was granted for air quality compliance the company made an enforceable commitment to the requisite clean air and environmental regulations but the environmental agent regulators did not micromanage how the company complied the result clean air with less cost and time there are countless opportunities for this principle to save time money and create innovation and importantly the potential to reduce opposition to the regulatory process itself building trust and confidence partnerships between the regulator and the regulated with more control more flexibility producing a cleaner safer environment this requires first and foremost an administration that can be trusted to act in good faith because too often regulatory reform is a tactic of those who are simply opposed to the regulation in its first instance this approach will only invite fierce opposition to watereddown protection the obama administration has established its environmental credentials and should be able to avoid or at least lay to rest that sort of concern there are two other necessary elements the standards must be clear and the parties must be both responsible and have the capacity to be held accountable nothing must allow the protection in question to be undercut indeed it may be reasonable for performancebased approaches to require higher standards and environmental protection and we certainly dont have to suspend current rules or regulations just give an alternative path for compliance that we can always fall back upon if people fall short once its clear that we can produce the environmental or other desired protections on a performance basis perhaps we can tackle redundant regulatory processes for instance california has arguably more stringent environmental regulations than the united states government itself can we figure out a way to apply that single more stringent standard rather than forcing individuals government agencies to comply with both in sum its always helpful for an administration to make sure our efforts at government regulation are effective and relevant by all means eliminate the unnecessary or the ineffective what is more important however is to usher in a new era of performancebased protections to improve
