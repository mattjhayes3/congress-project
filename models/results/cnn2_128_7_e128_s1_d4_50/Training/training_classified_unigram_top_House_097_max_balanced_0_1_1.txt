13 appropriations bills passed by the senate even that one was passed only by being secreted away in the first continuing rosolution only 2 of the 12 remaining bills have not been passed in the house and in the case of 1 of them the reason for nonaction is that it was appropriate to awa~t t 1e conference agreement on the defense aulthorization bill before moving the appropriation bill again here

pretty clear if you listen to the people who have spoken here today and i predict it will be true for those who speak here tomorrow and during the debate on the amendments that we all agree that something has got to be done about the deficit something has got to be done to reduce the amount of national income being absorbed by government something has go to be done to reduce interest rates by reducing the amount of money that the federal government borrows but i also assert that when you get beyond that basic agreement fundamental differences that divide this house and divide this country become very clear in the major budget substitutes that will be voted on next week there are clear differences as to how we achieve those goals i would like very briefly to take the budget which was reported by the house budget committee and compare it to the bipartisan recovery budget which will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of the republicans and the conservative democrats who seek to control the deficit by controling spending i would like also to compare based on tentative data the budget that will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of himself and conservative democrats to the socalled coalition budget which will be offered by the gentleman from wisconsin i think when you look at these comparisons you will see very clearly what the choices are before the house if you take the data contained in the vehicle reported by the house budget committee you can break the basic policy changes into five different areas what we do about nondefense discretionary what we do about targeted entitlements what we do about other spending reductions what we do about defense and what we do about taxes we are going to hear a lot of discussion in this budget debate about economic assumptions as we did in the last but what is relevant is not what we assume about the world but what we do about the realitics that we face i think in looking at what we do in these five functional categories you will clearly see the difference in the area of nondefense discretionary the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 72 percent more than the jones house budget committee vehicle over the period 1983 to 1985 in the area of targeted entitlements the only section other than revenues that will be reconciled that committees will be forced to make changes in under the reconciliation process the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 139 percent more than the jones house budget committee budget over the 3year period in the area of other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget reduces other spending 489 percent more than the house budget committee in the area of defense the jones house budget committee budget cuts defense 69 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the jones house budget committee budget raises taxes by 55 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget and in the end achieves the same bottom line basically these differences are repeated when you compare the aspin coalition budget and the bipartisan recovery budget that will be offered here if we look at nondefense discretionary and other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 62 percent more than the aspin coalition budget over the 3 years that the budget is in force in targeted entitlements the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 119 percent more than the aspin coalition substitute in defense excluding pay the aspin coalition budget cuts defense 83 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the aspin coalition budget raises taxes by 42 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget over 3 years o 1640 my point in making these comparisons is this the house next week is going to have to choose between two real options one option is embodied in the budget presented by the house budget committee and slightly modified in the coalition aspin substitute that option says let us raise taxes and slash defense so that we can continue spending as usual in washington the real alternative is the bipartisan recovery budget which says let us focus our attention on spend ing so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and so that we can let the american people keep more of what they earn those are the options that we must choose between do we want to raise taxes and slash de fense to continue spending or do we want to control spending so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and let the american people keep more money in their pockets to provide positive incentive for people to work save and invest those who have talked about how much trouble the economy is in would have ns deal with those economic problems be raising taxes and by increasing spendng i believe that those are the policies that brought us to this sorry state and i do not believe that going back to the policies of the 1960s and 1970s will solve our problems i think it is important that we pass a budget that gains control of spending and gains control of the deficit that puts strong downward pressure on interest rates but i think the focus has got to be on the problem and the problem is spending taxes were doubled over the last 6 years and yet the deficit grew every year our problem is not inadequate taxes our problem is excessive spending in the bipartisan recovery budget we have an opportunity to do something about that excessive spending so i hope that we will have a good debate in which everyone will look at the issues what do we do about domestic nondefense spending what do we do about meeting the legitimate defense needs of our nation how much burden do we place on the shoulders of the working men and women in america in those three areas the differences among these budgets will be very clear i would like to make one additional point and that is that we have heard and we will hear a lot of talk about equity are cuts fair do we treat entitlement and discretionary programs fairly in terms of choosing where to make reductions but i would submit to my colleagues that there is another issue of fairness and that issue has to do with taxes how much burden are we going to put on those who are pulling the wagon as well as the burden that we are going to put on those who are riding in the wagon and in the ultimate fairness test by controlling the growth of taxes and focusing revenue increases on reducing the deficit rather than increasing taxes to go on spending i believe the ultimate fairness issue is going to be settled on the side of the bipartisan recovery budget may 2l 1982 so i look forward to the debate and i believe when the american people look at the three choices when our colleagues look at these three areas of difference in defense in nondefense domestic spending and in taxes i believe the bipartisan recovery budget is going to be
