is moving to the center of the american political scene in part because of the attention that has been given to this by the administration vice president gore in particular but even more important because of the large grassroots pressure that has been building around the country as evidenced by over 240 local and state initiatives in the last election this is just the tip of the iceberg part of the evidence of this growing movement for livable communities has been the attention that has been given by the national media one of the best and most prominently featured articles was on the front

characterization of all this being new quality of life is truly one of our oldest and most enduring issues but whether it is a new emerging issue or one of timeless political concern it is time for congress to address livability now we need to get beyond the soundbite focus that are driven by partisan politics catering to narrow special interests it seems sadly to dominate our activities here so far this month we have had some of the worst of examples where americans concerned by violence on our schoolgrounds saw us respond by attempting to weaken our gun safety laws and by posting the 10 commandments in school yards something that is not going to inspire much confidence in the minds of most american families we do not have to make up issues or shy away from real problems there are simple commonsense approaches for dealing with livable communities in the area of gun violence we can approach it the same way that we have reduced auto deaths and injury on our roads we can make a huge difference in the threequarter million americans who have been killed by gun violence since 1960 an american government that has been able to take action to childproof aspirin bottles and cigarette lighters ought to be ashamed that there are more product safety protections for toy guns than for real guns we can start by simply passing the legislation already approved by the united states senate to close the gun show loophole and make it harder for children to get their hands on guns we can make strides to make our communities more livable dealing with the built environment all the time and money the federal government spends on physical infrastructure can be planned regionally and coordinated with our state local and private partners we can make the problems of air quality and traffic congestion better not simply throwing money at them and in some cases actually making them worse we can help manage the entire water cycle rather than have a flood insurance program that pays people to live where god does not want them despite being flooded out repeatedly most important we can have the federal government practice what we preach where we locate federal buildings how we manage our land we could even take the radical step of having the post office obey local land use laws zoning codes and work with local communities across the country before they make locational

counseling and coordination of federal regulatory outreach to americas small business community we know that the vast majority of small business owners are honest and hardworking people who want to do the right thing clearly this bill is an effort to help these small business owners just think it is highly unlikely that my colleagues or their staffs or even the staffs of the committees read the federal register on a daily basis yet that is what the government asks small business owners to do in order to determine which regulations affect them and what they must do to comply with those regulations let me give an example the proposed regulation to prevent ergonomic injuries is just 11 pages long however osha admits that these 11 pages are not selfexplanatory and determifing the best method of complying will require a small business owner to wade through nearly 1 500 pages of supplemental explanation and economic analysis small business owners want to comply with federal regulations but often they simply do not have the time or the expertise to determine how to comply with proposed rules this causes loss of revenue oftentimes that revenue would be used to grow for jobs when that happens it hurts us all h r 4946 is designed to assist small business owners navigate through the maze of federal regulations which continue to pour forth from the federal government h r 4946 would establish a pilot program in 20 small business development centers sbdcs throughout the united states these 20 centers would be charged with providing small business owners access to information and resources including current federal and state programs designed to provide small business owners with regulatory compliance assistance training materials and educational activities such as conferences and seminars confidential freeofcharge oneonone indepth counseling regarding compliance assistance technical assistance and referral to other experts such as professors in the university or colleges where the participating sbdc is located the sbdcs would track information and h r 4946 as amended would provide this information to the administrator of the sba for collection

firsthand knowledge of how effective this type of process can be before being elected to congress i served as the commissioner of labor in new york state i know firsthand the difficulty that exists in trying to balance the needs of running a small business and maintaining a safe working environment and creating jobs while i was state labor commissioner i instituted an exhaustive review process that resulted in a 30 percent reduction of outdated unnecessary duplicative or oppressive restrictions on new yorks businesses the result after that reduction in regulations was an increase in worker safety an increase in safety in the workplace as a former state regulator i understand that penalizing first and asking questions later is not necessarily the best use of a regulators time or their

argumentthe moratorium which he carries for us each year on the interior bill is not the best solution to this issue but i do not believe that the solution is to lift the ban and move forward on oil activity off the florida coast absent the kind of science based approach outlined in h r 33 nor do i believe florida should be punished for trying to be a good steward of its resources that is counter initiative and counter productive so i would encourage mr regula to join us in support of h r 33 indeed i might even go so far as to suggest that my good friend could solve this issue once and for all
