of the military construction appropriations bill for fiscal year 1989 i would first like to commend my chairman mr hefner and the ranking minority member mr bill lowery for crafting a bipartisan and fiscally responsible bill the committee has managed to draft a bill which meets the budget summit agreement of last fall and is less than the presidents request i would also like to thank the professional staff for their invaluable assistance as a member of the subcommittee on military construction i would like to take this opportunity to express my support on several issues which the committee addressed during the course of this fiscal year first this committee is committed to a more equitable distribution of our defense burden among our allies defense spending as a percentage of the gross national product in the united states is almost 7 percent which the nato allies average about 3 3 percent i understand that this figure does not recognize other nonnumerical contributions by our allies yet this is an indicator of the need for more fairness in providing mutual defense in these austere times second i share the committees concern about the lack of a strong physical plant revitalization program the average age of our buildings is 50 years there is a clear need to replace our existing facilities however the budget as proposed would equate to a facility replacement rate of more than 100 years i believe that without adequate funding our buildings will deteriorate beyond all repair thus impacting productivity and quality of lile the final issue i would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues is the need to replace the dilapidated world war ii vintage barracks almost 245 000 service members reside in these insufficient housing units at a time when recruitment and retention is a priority it is imperative that our service men and women live in quality housing thus encouraging reenlistment the appropriations committee has recommended 8 79 billion for fiscal year 1989 military construction and family housing the recommendations in this bill are consistent with the overall program level of the house authorization bill for military construction this bill is

colleagues and those who are watching this memorial sala burton served in this house for 3 years her husband served for close to two decades if you look at that statistic alone it does not really tell you the reality of the contributions of both phil and sala because they both served together during all those years they worked together collaborating together in the mutual objectives that they shared politically they both cared deeply about the role that government could play to help the disadvantaged the dispossessed to try to bring about social and economic justice they cared about the working people and the ability of those people to organize collectively to fight for their rights they always saw the people who were struggling who were having a tough time as the ones who needed their help most they cared about protecting the environment and they cared very deeply about this nation of ours sala burton was a refugee from poland she and her immediate family survived the nazi holocaust in europe those in the immediate family that did not come to this country were all lost in the crematoria of hitlers death camps that fact probably more than any other impressed upon sala the deep commitment to protecting civil liberties civil rights understanding that minority groups that might be discriminated against one day could be hated the next and uncontrolled discrimination and hatred can lead to such enormous evil that she knew we had to act before these kinds of things got out of hand on a personal note i have known sala and phil for close to 30 years when i was a young teenager and belonged to the young democrats in california phil and sai would talk to us when most grownup politicians were not spending any time with the kids about why politics was a noble thing to be involved in why the fights that we were fighting were often so frustrating were important and that we could make a contribution and that we had to keep on trying to make things better when my family and i came to washington the door was always open to us at the burton home 01450 i know that both when i was in sacramento and when we came here our daughter who is now 23 grew up calling sala burton aunt sala there was a very very close bond of friendship between our families on a very personal level they were always there phil and sala to give us some guidance some encouragement some reinvigoration of commitment to try to accomplish in some way the goals they set out for themselves and set as role models for us to try to emulate one of the most touching tributes at the lovely memorial service in san franscisco was given by the speaker of the state assembly another person who has gone back even longer than almost any of us who are involved in public office in his political and personal relationship with phil and sala and that was speaker willy brant he closed his very eloquent remarks by saying that the best memorial tribute to sala burton is to try to act the way saia acted to try to live up to the ideals that she not only personified but urged upon all of us if we in some way could live up to that standard we would be by that example following her example and giving the greatest memorial to her i hope that as we remember fondly the memories of sala burton and the time we have had with her over the years the time that she has been with us in this institution that we will try to live up to the standards that she set for all of us to the goals and ideals that she so strongly and firmly believed in and in that way we will indeed be giving a living memorial to all the work that she has done over the years i do want to indicate that my wife janet had the opportunity to do an interview with sala burton a couple of months ago and i will

to go down some of the objections and criticisms that have been lodged by some of my colleagues we have heard this afternoon that we do not need the wydensharpsynar amendment because most of our contractors are nonprofits who are making no money the facts tell us that only six receive no fee or a minimal 1 fee twenty to twentysix of those contractors however receive a lot of money 3 to 17 million in pure profit but even if that is the case the fee is unimportant because what we are saying here what we are trying to establish with this amendment is a standard of performance a standard of performance that a fee should not be tied to just because someone does not get a fee for performing a service does not mean they should not have to perform that service at a level at least of guaranteed safety another one of our colleagues has said that we do not need these because we already have criminal penalties and civil penalties are not necessary well i think we all know that there are going to be gaps very frankly where civil penalties are going to be necessary to fill those gaps when they are noncriminal offenses another one of our colleagues raises the objection that this runs counter to the government and contractors relationships no it does not our amendment simply does this it insures that our contractors are going to act appropriately it does not affect the relationship between government and the contractors another one of the objections we have heard today is that our operations are safe that over the last 30 years we have only paid out 1 5 million in penalties to that we say we are very grateful in fact we should not worry in fact those contractors who are acting in the safety standard very frankly have nothing to fear by this legislation this amendment just simply set a minimal performance standard and that is it we have heard today that we cannot do this amendment because doe is the arbiter and that congress sets the laws well the facts of the matter are that doe is not running these operations day to day the unitedstates congress is not running these operations at these plants day to day these are being done by contractors and they must be the ones who have to be accountable for the decisions that are being made on a daytoday basis finally we have heard an objection today that if we pass this amendment it is going to increase the cost the answer to that is that it may well do that but the facts of the matter are that will more perfectly reflect the cost of doing business in this particular area and that is something which we need to get a handle on so these six objections which we have heard today really do not hold water when we look at them but beside that i think we need to go back to some basic common sense and that is that all of us who represent districts that range in size and geographic areas throughout this country realize that none of our small businessmen none of those individuals who we represent have the opportunity or the privilege that we have given these contractors that they must meetat least a simple negligence standard today we are asking that this industry meet that same standard that a small businessman or an individual in our district would have to meet finally i stand before you today to say that we need to do this so that we do not start down this path not only with these contractors but others that they would think they can perform a duty that would include gross negligence and willful misconduct at the expense of the american public i urge my colleagues to adopt the wydensharpsynar amendment it corrects a basic flaw in the current priceanderson system today contractors at doe nuclear facilities enjoy a protected status which is unwarranted and inconsistent with federal policy in other areas they are held totally harmless for all damages even those which result from their own gross negligence or willful misconduct by removing this element of financial responsibility a crucial incentive for contractor safety and responsibility is lost no other federal law provides such sweeping protections for contractors as the priceanderson act most other laws offer no protection for gross negligence or willful misconduct these include superfund the clean water act the outer continental shelf lands act of 1978 and the swine flu act however throughout the course of our consideration of this issue the doe and its contractors have strongly resisted any type of accountability amendment in fact some contractors have threatened to walk away from their contracts if one is enacted they claim that their fees are small and do not warrant taking on any risk first of all contractors fees are not as small as they would have us believe they operate under costplus contracts and many contractors are receiving millions of dollars in profits for supplying a small number of people to manage a facility but a discussion of contractors profits is not relevant to the issue before us whether a fee is 1 or 10 million citizens and communities have a right to expect that contractors will manage these sensitive facilities responsibly and carefully andat the very leastwill not engage in gross negligence or knowingly violate regulations how can a contractor take the approach that because it doesnt make a certain amount of money it cannot be responsible for even such a minimal standard of performance why should the taxpayers be the ones to bear the costs of patently unsafe practices and activities this is a very moderate very reasonable amendment the provisions established a degree of financial responsibility while capping liability at levels flexible enough to permit large and small contractors to stay in the business special consideration is given to nonprofits and universities conducting research the performance standards are applied only to corporate officials and those in supervisory positionspeople who should be intimately familiar with all rules and proper procedures there is another reason why the way in which we resolve this issue is so important our decisions on this issue will have animpact on the way indemnification and accountability are handled in other environmental laws the issue of accountability for doe contractors has not been addressed since priceanderson was first adopted 30 years ago for that reason it has not served as a precedentyet but now that the issue is squarely before congress the way we resolve it could significantly affect standards in other laws if congress allows contractors to continue to be totally unaccountable or adopts very weak accountability provisions it will be sending a signal which may lead to efforts to weaken similar provision in other laws the only way to avoid such erosion is to enact standards which are comparable to those in existing laws in closing there is nothing radical about our proposalthat a corporation should be responsible for its actions and has an obligation to stockholders citizens and communities to conduct its business responsibly and safely we all have industries in our districts which are crucial to the well being of our states and the nation in my district farming ranching and oil and gas production are crucial industries yet the individuals and companies who participate in those ventures are responsible for their own actions no one excuses them from liabilities resulting from their own gross negligence or willful misconduct and they dont expect to be this is a basic tenetthat we are all taught from grade school and is a standard of our judicial system this amendment simply applies the same standard to contractors who operate our government nuclear facilities contractors should expect no more and our citizens deserve no less i urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment"], [0.0001150369644165039, 0.5001150369644165, 1, "i rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues an accomplishment of one of my young

brought this resolution to the floor in such an expeditious fashion given the fact that we only returned to work earlier today without the cooperation of my very good friends on the other side of the aisle the very distinguished ranking member of the committee on foreign affairs the gentleman from michigan mr baoomriel and the equally distinguished and able gentleman from iowa the ranking member of the subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs and of course without the support also of our beloved chairman the gentleman from florida the willingness of the members on the other side of the aisle to work with us in a genuinely bipartisan in fashioning a resolution that reflects the views of this entire house is greatly appreciated may i just say also that the resolution does have the strong support of the administration with whom we discussed the text as it evolved their willingness not only to endorse this resolution but to have spoken up on behalf of democracy and peaceful change in burma long before we even considered this resolution is greatly to their credit"]]}
