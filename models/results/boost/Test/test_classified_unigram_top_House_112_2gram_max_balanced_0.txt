unfortunately history has willed a different story army specialist garrett fant instead returned to lake tahoe last week as a fallen hero at the age of 21 this young man sacrificed all those years all those memories all those pleasuresand all that lifein the service of his country he loved the army and he had a plan for his lifehed serve his country as a soldier for 20 years and then he would come

school was the last stop for kids and he wanted to influence people hed have made a great family man his older brother remembers looking up to garrett as if garrett were the older brother knowing full well the dangers that surrounded him in afghanistan his foremost attention went to reassuring his family that he was safe and secure his mother said he always tried to protect me from the dangers of being over there he was just someone that if you were his family or his friendsor his countryhe gave you his all and loved you with everything above all garrett fant wanted to be a soldier his brother tried to get him to enlist with him in the navy but garrett would have none of that he was all army and had known from the time he was a little boy thats what he most wanted to do on facebook he listed his occupation as grunt telling his friends you cant spell infantry without fant he was the top marksman in his class of 1 000 i wish id known him i wish my grandchildren might one day have

douglas macarthur turned his attention to fallen heroes like army specialist garrett fant and with searing insight he observed their story is known to all of you it is the story of the american man at arms my estimate of him was formed on the battlefields many many years ago and has never changed i regarded him then as i regard him now as one of the worlds noblest figures not only as one of the finest military characters but also as one of the most stainless his name and fame are the birthright of every american citizen in his youth and strength his love and loyalty he gave all that mortality can give he needs no eulogy from me or any other man and macarthur goes on to say but when i think of his patience under adversity of his courage under fire and his modesty in victory i am filled with an emotion of admiration i cannot put into words he belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism he belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom and so garrett fant became a teacher after all as shakespeare said this story shall the good man teach his son succeeding generations of students at south lake tahoe high school and also at valley oak high school in american canyon which garrett also attended will know his story every memorial day in his hometown his name will be read with a special pride that his friends and neighbors will share strangers will pass by his honored grave adorned with flags and flowers and theyll note the few years he had and the sacrifice he made

that that optimism has been validated again and again and again actually there are positive signs while it gets very little attention we have come together to craft solutions the issue that ive been

election was to join together to strengthen our hand against russias outrageous actions by passing permanent normal trade relations we did it with one of the largest bipartisan and bicameral votes

rigorous debate and there needs to be that clash of ideas a rigorous debate but it needs to be done in good faith and with a spirit of compromise now i realize that some argue that compromise is a sign of weakness in fact one of the great strengths of our nations founders was their ability to compromise the very structure of this institution the united states congress the very structure of our institution which joins the peoples house where were all privileged to serve with the statefocused united states senate was known as what the connecticut compromise or the great compromise thats the very basis of our founders too often we forget that while we should neverwe should never compromise our principles we must always we must always be prepared to compromise in the service of our principles a couple of weeks ago the economist described another example of compromise this one in what justice brandeis described as one of the laboratories of democracy that being the state of georgia the conservative republican governor our former house colleague nathan deal and the liberal mayor of atlanta kasim reed are clearly at opposite ends of the political spectrum yet they have managed to bridge that divide through a commitment to results together they have achieved significant gains for the good of georgia congress and the white house are perfectly capable of following that same model for the good of our country americans may be politically divided but they are united in their desire to see their leaders in washington achieve results now we know its far from perfect but

finding out whats in this bill in the last 2 years weve had 47 committee hearings in six different committees weve taken 25 floor votes to repeal defund or dismantle harmful elements of this massive 1 trillion 2 000page government takeover of our nations health care system were finding out whats in this bill weve already repealed the 1099 requirement with bipartisan support weve already repealed the class act with bipartisan support now were awaiting the supreme courts decision on whether the individual mandate is constitutional i think the public is now beginning to learn a little bit about this bill themselves i think they know there is a 3 8 percent tax on small businesses our job creators theres another 2 3 percent tax on medical deviceswheelchairs for our seniors hearing aids for our disabled folks these are things that are in this bill theres a 40 percent tax on your health care plans now they keep telling us too that if you like your health care plan you can keep it well president obama himself said you know there may have been some language snuck into this bill that runs contrary to that premise who do we believe here what do we believe here we are again one more thing to add to the list of what were finding out ipab the independent payment advisory board this unelected board makes decisions and gives recommendations to congress for cutting medicare payments

american people would have 6 percent unemployment in exchange for trillions of taxpayer dollars to pump into the economy today we know that the stimulus program was mismanaged illconceived and failed to create the jobs promised by the president for 38 straight months and counting the unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent the american people realize something that my democrat friends dont seem to understand that government cannot create jobs and shouldnt be in the business of handing out jobs in 2010 the american people sent me and many of my colleagues to washington to cut government spending and offer real solutions to job creation we have been aggressively fighting to achieve that challenge our country needs commonsense progrowth policies that will help small business regain their confidence when business owners have faith that the government will not raise their taxes impose new unnecessary regulations and pick winners and losers in the marketplace theyll invest more when they invest more the company grows and the opportunity for american jobs grows with it just last week we saw a very clear picture of the different visions for job creation held by folks in washington my friends in the senate voted on but thankfully failed to pass the buffett rule the act would impose a tax hike on one class of americans and would pay for approximately 11 hours of government functioning talk about a cynical ruse serving only to divide our country for political purposes but while my democrat colleagues in the senate are working to raise taxes on americans and americas job creators the house is trying to lower them last week we passed a small business tax cut which will give businesses with fewer than 500 employees a 20 percent tax reduction off their active business income and encourage the creation of more jobs for our citizens data shows that 7 out of every 10 jobs in this country are created by companies with fewer than 500 employees my republican colleagues and i truly believe that small businesses are the backbone of our countrys economy and their success is vital to our economic recovery we continue to act proactively and as reflected in the 27 jobcreating measures passed by the house this congress alone to ensure job providers are able to create innovate and lead we hope our friends in the senate and white house will

celebrating his retirement surrounded by generations of his students and his children and grandchildren they would have all told affectionate stories about how mr fant inspired them or helped them and wished him a happy and welldeserved retirement unfortunately history has willed a different story army specialist garrett fant instead returned to lake tahoe last week as a fallen hero at the age of 21 this young man sacrificed all those years all those memories all those pleasuresand all that lifein the service of his country he loved the army and he had a plan for his lifehed serve his country as a soldier for 20 years and then he would come and serve his community as a high school history teacher from everything ive learned about garrett fant he would have made a great history teacher his mother told a reporter his thought was that high school was the last stop for kids and he wanted to influence people hed have made a great family man his older brother remembers looking up to garrett as if garrett were the older brother knowing full well the dangers that surrounded him in afghanistan his foremost attention went to reassuring his family that he was safe and secure his mother said he always tried to protect me from the dangers of being over there he was just someone that if you were his family or his friendsor his countryhe gave you his all and loved you with everything above all garrett fant wanted to be a soldier his brother tried to get him to enlist with him in the navy but garrett would have none of that he was all army and had known from the time he was a little boy thats what he most wanted to do on facebook he listed his occupation as grunt telling his friends you cant spell infantry without fant he was the top marksman in his class of 1 000 i wish id known him i wish my grandchildren might one day have been his high school history students instead army specialist garrett fant takes his place in history among nine generations of american heroes who sacrificed all those precious years to protect those who couldnt protect themselves to stand up to the bullies of the world to proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof in his farewell address at west point general douglas macarthur turned his attention to fallen heroes like army specialist garrett fant and with searing insight he observed their story is known to all of you it is the story of the american man at arms my estimate of him was formed on the battlefields many many years ago and has never changed i regarded him then as i regard him now as one of the worlds noblest figures not only as one of the finest military characters but also as one of the most stainless his name and fame are the birthright of every american citizen in his youth and strength his love and loyalty he gave all that mortality can give he needs no eulogy from me or any other man and macarthur goes on to say but when i think of his patience under adversity of his courage under fire and his modesty in victory i am filled with an emotion of admiration i cannot put into words he belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism he belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom and so garrett fant became a teacher after all as shakespeare said this story shall the good man teach his son succeeding generations of students at south lake tahoe high school and also at valley oak high school in american canyon which garrett also attended will know his story every memorial day in his hometown his name will be read with a special pride that his friends and neighbors will share strangers will pass by his honored grave adorned with flags and flowers and theyll note the few years he had and the sacrifice he made and be humbled by it and perhaps inspired by it to become better citizens no history teacher can do more than that to his grieving family on behalf of a grateful nation i can only say that you do not mourn alone your pride in garrett is shared by your community by your country and by many many history teachers who will tell his story to
