strong supporter of the legi slation i hail its passage but title vi of this legislation is drawn from a bill that i introduced in the first session of the 109th congress my legislation is known as the child pornography prevention act of 2005 and as the title states the intent of my legislation is to prevent american chjldren from becoming victims of pornography every one of us knows that the fuel that fires the wicked hearts of child predators is child pornography and it must be confronted in america every day in this country children are sadly exploited in pornographic enterprises sometimes b those closest to them believe it or not in their homes sometimes by commercial producers in the home children are forced to pose for pornographic pictures or act in pornographic videos sometimes by family members and even friends and caretakers and other trusted individuals sadly our resources in the law enforcement community inform us that these pictures and videos are posted on the internet or surreptitiously spread to sexual predators in the commercial arena and in hollywood as our cultures become more and more youth oriented and sex has become more and more prevalent we must ensure that children are not being used in the production of prurient material and provide law enforcement with the tools to prosecute those who exploit children a main tenet of my legislation is the language that will fix a technicality known as home pornographers to get at the first problem that i just described home pornographers have used this loophole to evade federal prosecution in child pornography cases these individuals will use digital cameras polaroid cameras video cameras to make pornographic images of children download them and distributethem on the internet my legislation first and foremost makes it clear that federal prosecutions of home pornographers may proceed in federal court because their activities impact on interstate commerce another element of my bill which has become in many ways more controversial is the addition of a new section of the criminal code section 2257a which adds a recordkeeping requirement that will force people in even in the entertainment industry to keep records of the names and ages of their subjects along with proof of their identification when they are engaged even in simulated sexual activity on screen anytime hollywood uses a simulated sex act in a soap opera a cable television show a movie or other production a record must be kept to show that a child was not used even in the creation of a simulated sex act heretofore the law has only required that such records be kept in the cases of hardcore pornography where actual sex was being performed and recorded for entertainment value but if a child is used in a simulated sex act the impact of such abuse on that child is in many ways just as real as it would be had the production involved actual sexual contact therefore my bill require these records be kept for simulated sex because by doing so certain bad actors in the entertainment industry will be deterred from using children also my bill goes a step further by requiring that records be kept even in the case of what is known as lascivious exhibition once again no child should be used in either nude pictures or sexually explicit materials or even in activities that have a prurient interest this is again the type of images that fuel the flames of the wicked hearts of child predators and should be stopped finally the legislation expands the ability of investigators and prosecutors to pursue the people who are used to distribute child pornography these distributors also will be required to follow these new recordkeeping provisions and this will provide law enforcement with a powerful tool against them as well providing law enforcement with the tools to combat child pornography contained in my legislation is a muchneeded and overdue step that must be taken to protect our children from those in society who have no decency and no shame i also commend those legitimate producers of entertainment products in the united states of america with whom we have had dialogue and with whom we have worked in the development of this legislation it is not my purpose in any way to suggest that those that are involved in the legitimate entertainment industry in this country have anything to do with the illegitimate industry that is pornography in america nevertheless it is important that even in main street hollywood america that we ensure that children are not used even in the creation of entertainment materials that simulate sex acts and our legislation will create the recordkeeping to prevent just that i hail the passage of the child pornography prevention act as a part of the child

and historic legislation that will come before the congress tomorrow the senat has already passed legislation reforming class action lawsuit abuses and now the house of representatives will take it up and pass it and send it to the president of the united states why is this such a historic occasion because abuses in class actions have been going on for many years in fact this house has worked for over 6 years to reform this difficulty and get to the point where we are today this legislation has passed the house of representatives in each of the last three congresses but each time it was stymied in the united states senate the fact of the matter is that as the legislation progressed through the house it got more and more votes more and more bipartisan support but never could get the threshold needed to pass in the other body that has now changed the senate has passed legislation it is a little different from what the house has passed in the past but it holds the same core principle of reforming the abuses that are taking place today all across the country with class action lawsuits some of these abuses are absolutely startling in a nationwide class action lawsuit filed in alabama against the bank of boston over mortgage escrow accounts the class members won the case but actually lost money under the settlement agreement the 700 000 class members received small payments of just a couple of dollars or no money at all about a year later they found out that anywhere from 90 to 140 had been deducted from their escrow accounts to pay their lawyers legal feels of 8 5 million in other words they had to pay more than they have received in settlement in order to satisfy multimillion dollar attorneys fees when som of those class members sued their class action lawyers for malpractice the lawyers countersued them for 25 million saying their former clients were trying to harass them in another classic case in the settlement of a class action lawsuit in madison county illinois against thompson consumer electronics over alleged faulty television sets consumers were eligible for rebates on future purchases ranging in value from 25 to 50 if you spent more than 100 on a thompson electronics product so in other words your settlements was a coupon to buy more of what was alleged to being defective in the first place how did the attorneys do well the attorneys pocketed 22 million in attorneys fees some consumers reportedly walked away from the settlement altogether because the form was so complicated and the attorneys fees were so high recently president bush had down at the commerce department a forum to discuss these abuses and one of these plaintiffs in this thompson electronics case was there and after explaining what she had been through and the frustration of having a television set that did not work and being represented in a class action that did not work and winding up with a coupon to buy something she did not want to buy and seeing the attorneys get 22 million in attorneys fees she said where is the justice in that the fact of the matter is there is no justice in our current class action system and it is in effect a racket how did we get to this point well it has to do with a problem with our federal laws when our founding fathers wrote our constitution they very wisely provided for a federal judiciary a judiciary that could hear cases from different people in different states so that if in the founding of our country and ever since people felt that they might not be treated as fairly in a foreign jurisdiction in a court across the country somewhere far from where they have lived they could have the opportunity to remove it to the federal courts where they would in theory get more impartial tieatment this has persisted for the entire history of our country however our founding fathers never heard of class action lawsuits they are a 20thcentury development and they are not without their merit class actions afford efficiencies to our courts because if people have an identical claim against one or more defendants they can be consolidated into a class and brought before the court in an efficient manner and sometimes these cases involve hundreds of thousands or even millions of plaintiffs this legislation does nothing to affect the right of people to bring their class action lawsuits in state courts or federal courts but under the original establishment of our federal courts this diversity jurisdiction of the courts where you had parties from different states disputing each other had to set a minimum amount before you could bring the case into courts and over the years that number has risen to 75 000 per plaintiff so in other words if a person who lives in my state of virginia has an injury in the state of maryland across the potomac river and they bring a lawsuit in the state court if that case involves more than 75 000 in damages the case can be removed to the federal courts however when you apply that rule to class actions it is the same it is 75 000 but it is per plaintiff so if you have a million plaintiffs in a case you have to multiply by one million times 75 000 or show a 75 billion case in order to get into federal court that is wrong that a 75 000 simple case that can easily be handled in the state courts would be entitled to the federal courts and a 75 billion case or say a 70 billion case less than the 75 billion threshold there cannot get into the federal courts it is wrong it should be corrected and this legislation does it in a very simple fashion instead of 75 000 per plaintiff it is 5 million but 5 million for the entire class all the claims added together and this will mean that no longer will you have what is called forum shopping taking place where the plaintiffs attorneys can choose the jurisdiction they want to bring the case in and keep it there why is that significant because we have over 4 000 jurisdictions across the country 4 000 different state jurisdictions sometimes simple county governments sometimes a collection of counties within a state but 4 000 different places where you can bring a lawsuit the plaintiffs attorneys and there are only a small number of plaintiffs attorneys who handle these big class action lawsuits the plaintiffs attorneys know which of those 4 000 jurisdictions maybe a dozen maybe two dozen of them are overwhelmingly biased and favorable to the plaintiffs in a class action there was one state court county in alabama a few years ago where more nationwide class action lawsuits were considered in that one county than the entire federal judiciary of more than 600 district court judges combined that is an abuse today the same thing takes place in other jurisdictions around the country and this legislation would correct that more importantly it would treat all the parties fairly because not only could the defendants remove a case to federal courts but any or all of the plaintiffs in the case would also have the right to remove that case to federal court under appropriate circumstances the judge would have discretion if the case looked like it really did principally involve people in one state it would be kept in that state but if it clearly is a nationwide class action lawsuit it can be moved to federal court where it will get more evenhanded treatment and a more standard application of the law then these select jurisdictions that are getting all the class action cases today that is what the problem is in addition to changing the jurisdictional requirements there are also other things that will make it easier for plaintiffs to be treated fairly and defendants to be treated fairly as well the washington post is one of more than 100 newspapers around the country that have endorsed this legislation and they said it so wisely a few years ago they have been supporting this for a long time we do not often on our side of the aisle cite the washington post but this gives you an idea of how serious this problem is and how widespread the support for this problem is the clients get token payments while the lawyers get enormous fees this is not justice it is an extortion racket that only congress can fix i say to my fellow members of congress tomorrow we are going to do just that and send a bill identical to the bill with the

can fulfill its core objectiveto serve as an institution that supports the preservation of international peace and security i feel this objective is at risk finally it is important to highlight the flexibility that is built into this legislation it allows the administration 2 years to work with the u n to make these necessary reforms before the withholding provision is triggered even after 2 years it does not insist that every one of the reforms be implemented but allows an additional year for the u n to complete the job if the u n adopts measures that achieve the same purpose as those outlined in this bill it allows the full unitedstates contribution to be expended and if the u n chooses not to implement these needed reforms the legislation authorizes the contributions that are withheld from expenditure to remain available until the u n acts in 1949 dean acheson said that the united states must work actively to make the united nations an effective instrument of international cooperation there is and always will be a role for america in ensuring that the u n lives up to the ideals of its charter by pushing for these critical reforms i believe that we can forge the u n into the effective instrument of international cooperation that we all hope it can be it is my belief that this legislation is the instrument to get the job doneto make the u n the organization that its

waste or fraud the regulatory agencies in charge put on layer upon layer of additional regulatory burdens to try to prevent it i am not criticizing them for that but that is just the way the system works they try to figure out how did this person cheat us how can we put some additional regulations in place so that we do not let that happen again every time that happens legitimate providers of services for medicare as an example or health care have to continue to comply with this increasing burden of regulations that we have put in place this costs them money in a business when you have to comply with a regulation of some sort you either have to hire somebody to help you with that a direct cost or you have to allocate some resource within your organization who was previously working to help you make money and help you provide services to clients to comply with that so either one of those costs those providers within the system money and it is a direct result of cheaters in our system now i am not advocating that we do not go find the cheaters let us go find them and point them out but let us also help all of us understand that as people cheat that increases government

commerce in arms act i am forced to oppose this legislation primarily because of unconstitutional gun control amendments added tothe bill in the senate as a firm believer in the second amendment to the united states constitution and an opponent of all federal gun laws i cannot support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls on americans i believe that the second amendment is one of the foundations of our constitutional liberties in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gunstorage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired further the severe penalties for non compliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states second a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess armor piercing bullets just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397 i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering h r 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments notably gun owners of america has written to house members to request that they oppose s 397 and instead support h r 800 last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397 while i am concemed about some of the federalism implications of h r 800 it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices with 258 sponsors and cosponsors h r 800 would easily pass the house the house voting for h r 800 would allow the differences between h r 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee in conference every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original unamended s 397 had 62 senate sponsors and cosponsorsa filibuster proof majority in the senate i regret that under the guise of helping gun owners the house of representatives is today considering imposing new unconstitutional gun controls i thus must oppose s 397"]], "top_unsure": [[0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 sergeant first
