only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this

of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things

they are in accord with the view that civil rights enforcement should be strengthened their recent report on the current problems of the justice departments enforcement efforts reflect their deep

a ukranian nationalist association and writing zamizdat the underground press he was sentenced to 30 years that began strokatakaravanskis long stuggle to secure freedom for her husband she petitioned the government and like her companion nadia svitlychny wrote of her husbands plight for the underground press in 1972 when the soviet government began staging mass arrests of ukranian intellectuals and artists these women fled to the caucasus in the north for safety unfortunately it was to no avail for the police were not long in catching them no reason was given for strokatakaravanskis arrest but she is certain it stemmed from her fight on behalf of her husband she spent 4 years at the labor camp before being released in december 1975 four more years elapsed while she waited for her husband to complete his 30year term today after half a lifetime of waiting and hoping the two have been reunited and reside in the united states the most tragic thing about the story that unfolded in

out those individuals in their respective districts which have ethnic heritage and allow them through some mechanism to serve in an advisory capacity on both domestic and international issues my

carolina it was a particular privilege for me because my own father swore me in and that day when he permitted me to come within the bar of that curt he granted me a great privilege but concomitant with that privilege he also granted me a lot or responsibility the issue today is not whether poor people are entitled to legal services the issue today is whose responsibility is it to provide them for 15 years the congress of the united states has been trying to give people rights and take away their responsibilities the issue today is whether or not the legal business is a profession or a trade whether or not members of the bar have an obligation to do pro bono work one of the greatest deans of aiy law school ever in this country was dean carroll weathers and he spent many months in our senior year at wake forest law school instilling in us the history of the legal profession since the days of the greek citystates how advocacy was originally not something one pursued for gain or profit because ark advocate was not paid he was granted an honorarium but our legal profession wants to get rid of its responsibilities to the poor and have the american taxpayer assume those responsibilities because it is beneath the dignity or not in the economic interests of the wealthy wall street lawyers to take their time pursuing the interests of the poor and the indigent well actually we are doing the organized bar a great disservice by taking this responsibility away from them because once we do it then they become merely purveyors of their minds and their souls at the highest hourly rate because they have no responsibility that enures to their professlon somehow or another i do not think we will have done them a favor in the long run by taking away this responsibility we wm have denied them something special something that comes with being a professional i do not think any doctor in this country would deny a person needing an operation this operation because he could not pay for it if so they do not warrant the recognition that the hippocratic oath grants them but one thing is for sure if the legal profession does not pick up and assume the responsibilities to the poor the indigent it should not be the burden of the taxpayers of the united states to take up their responsibilities if we take it over they will never regain it and what was

of premeditated genocide which was unprecedented in the civilized world today with the opening prayer in the house of representatives by archbishop torkom manoogian we are being called on to remember this time of their suffering which has been nearly forgotten by so many of us we must not allow the world to forget that on april 24 1915 the turks began a planned and coordinated operation which was designed to destroy the armenian culture and kill every armenian living in lands under turkish oodupation of the 3 million armenians alive at that time 1 5 million were either killed violently or died of thirst and starvation after being driven into the desert any time one nation sets out to destroy another nation or people a great crime against humanity is committed if we do not express our outrage against this crime it will be committed again in the future the armenians who live in our communities today are the survivors of this merciless killing they must serve to constantly remind us

when in times of crises a leader emerges with the capacity to cope effectively with the many crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski president polishamerican congress the honorable francis j meehan ambassador to poland the honorable william wilson the presidents personal envoy to the holy see and peter s bridges director eastern european affairs department of state also participating in the ceremony and of special meaning to me was the delegation from the archdiocese of detroit headed by his excellency edmund szoka archbishop of detroit who was accompanied by the reverend stanley milewski chancellor of orchard lake schools orchard lake mich mrs helen zielinska president of the polish womens alliance and mr joseph drobot president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent

result of the commissions work it was decided that the seaward boundary would be fixed by a lateral projection of the current land boundary both the legislatures of north and south carolina have since

real offense was a strong desire for freedom from the oppression of the soviet police state he has been incarcerated because his conscience would not permit him to stand idle in the face of persecution and injustice and he bravely protested soviet policies preventing emigration and threatening those who wish to practice their religion for those who do not consider the sovet government a threat to all individual liberty i urge careful attention to the case of anatoly shcharansky following his initial request for a visa anatoly lost his job soviet authorities made it extremely difficult for him to marry by refusing to grant permission for a civil ceremony and making lame excuses when anatoly finally was allowed to marry his wife was forced to leave the soviet union 1 day after their wedding this was only the beginning of shcharanskys struggle he faced 3 years of repeated harassment and surveillance by the kgb along with vicious attacks in the soviet press his wife remains waiting for him in israel shcharansky was imprisoned for well over a year with no trial and no opportunity to visit or even communicate with friends and family he then was tried and received a predetermined sentence totaling 13 years he continues to serve that sentence today and our efforts are one of his few hopes for early release and the chance to be reunited with his wife last evening i

been reduced to a trickle and increased pressure and brutality are the price for those who state their intention to leave as we mark this sad anniversary of soviet inhumanity i ask once agath that all
