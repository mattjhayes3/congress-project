against this resolution it is unfortunate that menachem begin has openly opposed this transfer of military equipment thus putting the united states in the position of appearing to rebuff israel while attempting to satisfy unitedstates national interests in saudi arabia with the continuing turmoil and the complexity of the problems in the middle east and persian gulf area it was inevitable that american policies in that region would not always be supported by israel however we must not alienate ourselves from all arab nations so that we can continue to appease the israelis the line must be drawn no other nationnot even israeldictates what unitedstates foreign policies will be the vulnerability of the countries in the middle east to hostile aggression has been demonstrated in afghanistan iran and egypt we simply cannot afford to loose access to our vital oil supplies and allow freedom to be squelched by refusing aid to our allies i contend that saudi arabia is a valuable friend to the

continuing security of saudi arabia want to express my strong support for house concurrent resoultion 194 and my strenuous opposition to president reagans proposed sale of awacs to saudi arabia my opposition to this sale is based on three different factors first this sale represents a serious threat to the security of israel our closest friend and most stable and reliable ally in the middle east in any offensive effort against israel the awacs would represent a yital asset to the arab nations and would seriously upset the balance of powers between the arabs and israel even if we can believe the saudis promise that they will not use the equipment against israel we have no guarantees that the saudis will not transfer the awacs to another arab nation for use against israel second i believe that this sale represents a breach of a solemn public promise which the unitedstates government made in 1978 this promise was made both to the unitedstates congress and to the government of israel it is no secret that without this promise the senate would never have voted to approve the sale of f15 jets to saudi arabia in 1978 in my view a promise made is a promise kept by breaking our commitment here we put in doubt all commitments which our government has ever made in the past or will in the future finally it is dangerous to the security of the united states to transfer this

consolidate and streamline federal civil rights efforts an unintended effect of the many statutes and regulations which provide jurisdiction over civil rights complaints has often been to deny swift and fair justice for persons who have been discriminated against the backlog in federal agencies creates unnecessary delays additional costs and causes further overcrowding in already overburdened federal courts this problem is not endemic to the reagan administration in 1977 many of those who have cosponsored h r 5689 introduced legislation to make the law rationally applicable and consistent and provide greater protection to individuals discriminated against over the past several months i have been working with respresentatives of the leadership conference on civil rights and using their valuable suggestions for improvement in the 1977 bill and subsequent drafts although the leadership conference disagrees with some of the specifics of the bill as well as its timing they are in accord with the view that civil rights enforcement should be strengthened their recent report on the current problems of the justice departments enforcement efforts reflect their deep concern with this important issue the civil rights act of 1982 provides uniform procedures and requires prompt investigation and resolution of civil rights complaints agencies which are responsible for program evaluation and civil rights compliance retain the authority to conduct investigations and attempt to resolve complaints for the first time overall enforcement is centralized and made mandatory i hope that the congress views this legislation as a basis for exploration of critical issues in federal civil rights enforcement the overall role of the justice department the proper test to avoid actions which have discriminatory effects an affirmative duty of the federal government to provide protection against discrimination should be deliberated in hearings before the house judiciary committee

forseeable effects i believe the congress should explore how best to frame a reasonable test that compli s with the underlying affirmative duty to avoid actions which produce discriminatory effects h r 5689 is an attempt to provide a basis for consensus the civil rights act of 1982 is intended to dramatically improve the effectiveness of current federal civil rights enforcement efforts the act

actually we are doing the organized bar a great disservice by taking this responsibility away from them because once we do it then they become merely purveyors of their minds and their souls at the highest hourly rate because they have no responsibility that enures to their professlon somehow or another i do not think we will have done them a favor in the long run by taking away this responsibility we wm have denied them something special something that comes with being a professional i do not think any doctor in this country would deny a person needing an operation this operation because he could not pay for it if so they do not warrant the recognition that the hippocratic oath grants them but one thing is for sure if the legal profession does not pick up and assume the responsibilities to the poor the indigent it should not be the burden of the taxpayers of the united states to take up their responsibilities if we take it over they will never regain it and what was once a great and noble profession will degenerate into a mere craft"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "70 years ago hadassah the womens zionist organization of america was founded upon a spirit of peace and service to

ago we heard our colleague from illinois ask where august 1982 co the american conscience is today with respect to the killing of lebanese civillans and the destruction of beirut by israeli forces i would like to be a little bit more pointed and ask where is the conscience of the unitedstates house of representatives and especially the house foreign affairs committee the foreign affairs committee at times appears to give us a resolution at the drop of a hat where are they now i would ask when will we hear from them nextwhen we are asked to support additional aid to lebanon for the destruction caused by americansupplied arms for israel just last night on an evening nbc television news program we saw john chancellor broadcasting from beirut he said systematic the shelling of beirut seemed quite different when one sees it directly seeing it thus he said is seeing the imperial israel as a longterm supporter of israel and like many americans regardless of ethnic religious or partisan background i am appalled by the destruction over killing of innocent civilians in beirut it must stop fear of political pressure should not deter this house from its conscientious duty to express its outrage i hope that the foreign affairs committee will soon give us some opportunity to do that in a formal fashion in conclusion i call my colleagues attention to an article by mr milton viorst in the washington post of august 1 1982 which helps explain why the israel involved in the continuing destruction of beirut is not the israel it used to be that article has been included by this member in that section of todays congressional record called extension of remarks"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a major television newscaster this morning reported that last night we cast the constitution aside in order

was more than unusual it was unconstitutional and it was unconscionable once the american people begin to really understand that law means nothing in this body only politics and convenience move us

"a matter of extreme importance to the continued protection of unitedstates interests in the middle east and support of our allies in that region comes before this body of congress today that is the resolution to disapprove of the sale of awacs and jet fighter equipment to our friends in saudi arabia i wish to go on record as strongly supporting the administratin in its decision to make this sale and i urge my colleagues to do likewise by voting against this resolution it is unfortunate that menachem begin has openly opposed this transfer of military equipment thus putting the united states in the position of appearing to rebuff israel while attempting to satisfy unitedstates national interests in saudi arabia with the continuing turmoil and the complexity of the problems in the middle east and persian gulf area it was inevitable that american policies in that region would not always be supported by israel however we must not alienate ourselves from all arab nations so that we can continue to appease the israelis the line must be drawn no other nationnot even israeldictates what unitedstates foreign policies will be the vulnerability of the countries in the middle east to hostile aggression has been demonstrated in afghanistan iran and egypt we simply cannot afford to loose access to our vital oil supplies and allow freedom to be squelched by refusing aid to our allies i contend that saudi arabia is a valuable friend to the united states and join with three former presidents the present administration and many of my colleagues in congress in calling for congressional support of this bold initiative to help insure the continuing security of saudi arabia want to express my strong support for house concurrent resoultion 194 and my strenuous opposition to president reagans proposed sale of awacs to saudi arabia my opposition to this sale is based on three different factors first this sale represents a serious threat to the security of israel our closest friend and most stable and reliable ally in the middle east in any offensive effort against israel the awacs would represent a yital asset to the arab nations and would seriously upset the balance of powers between the arabs and israel even if we can believe the saudis promise that they will not use the equipment against israel we have no guarantees that the saudis will not transfer the awacs to another arab nation for use against israel second i believe that this sale represents a breach of a solemn public promise which the unitedstates government made in 1978 this promise was made both to the unitedstates congress and to the government of israel it is no secret that without this promise the senate would never have voted to approve the sale of f15 jets to saudi arabia in 1978 in my view a promise made is a promise kept by breaking our commitment here we put in doubt all commitments which our government has ever made in the past or will in the future finally it is dangerous to the security of the united states to transfer this equipment to the saudi regime"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a point of information on my records i had 15 minutes yielded to me there have been only two people
