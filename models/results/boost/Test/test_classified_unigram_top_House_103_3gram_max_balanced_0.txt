this as the only alternative we have in this session and it is flawed i hope it will be improved as we complete the process but this is our last opportunity as members of this body to effectively apprise our leadership and our constituents that we want the deficit reduced and we know that the only way we are going to accomplish it is by reductions in spending few decisions over how to vote on pending legislation have given me so much difficulty as the pennykasich spending reduction amendmnent what concerns me is not that federal spending cannot be cut by 90 billion over the next 5 years i strongly believe it can and should be done indeed i supportand have cosponsored bills that would achieve even greater spending reductions over this same time period therefore my concern over the pennykasich amendment is not because of the amount of spending cuts it proposes i am dubious of the reductions in national security proposed by the pennykasich amendment having been actively involved in shaping the fiscal year 1994 department of defense authorization bill and conference report recently adopted i know we have already implemented billions of dollars in defense spending reductions that are significant i am one of those who believe that we have already decreased defense spending too muchnot too little the reductions in defense spending specified by the pennykasich amendment are not in themselves large but they come on top of cuts in each and every fiscal year since 1985 unless the administration reverses its position on defense spending for fiscal years 19951998 our nations defense capabilities will suffer in an unacceptable way"]]}
