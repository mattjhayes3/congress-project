carriers were discontinuing the sale of medical liability insurance but because too many physicians felt forced to leave their practice leave their specialty or leave the state for a more affordable state but 10 years ago in wisconsin we figured out a reasonable answer i led the fight to create a new medical liability system where injured parties receive every single dollar of economic damages to which they are entitled but where there is a modest cap on noneconomic damages things like pain and suffering loss of society loss of companionship you know what it worked we hear a lot about studies here we know as a fact in wisconsin it worked in a short period of time wisconsin became one of only six states not to have a medical liability crisis as a result as the state medical society reported physicians especially those in highrisk specialties actually moved into our state from states like ohio and pennsylvania and florida and illinois it worked but sadly my state recently lost its way even though by any reasonable measure our reforms work the wisconsin courts struck them down we can only hope that wisconsin enacts a new medical liability reform act but until then we should pass the health act it will not only help wisconsin doctors and patients but those in every state facing a medical liability crisis this bill is statefriendly it does not preempt state reforms if a state like wisconsin has a cap on noneconomic damages whether that cap is higher or lower that cap will take effect more important it is doctorfriendly it is patientfriendly it will help us get a handle on at

over illegal immigration doctrines state leaders are stepping in across the couhtry just this week in colorado lawmakers took a cue from their citizens by cutting through the conflict and passed 11 bipartisan bills taking a tougher stance on illegal entry just like houston illegals have been drawn to colorado like moths to a flame and like many states colorado has left the porch light on for them because they have bad laws that encourage illegal entry such as laws that protect employers that hire illegals providing illegals benefits that many americans do not receive such as unemployment grants and even medical care this may explain why half of colorados immigrants are illegal but those days may be over because now state legislators are aiming to flip the switch and turn out the lights and turn off the benefits that make being illegal so lucrative this week they passed 11 immigration bills including making people prove that they are legal residents of colorado in order to receive state and federal benefits that is a farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom line those businesses who exploit illegals make a profit off of cheap labor but americans pick up the tab for all social services now they are going

those illicit businesses money in the form of fines if they do not keep records proving that they hire only legal residents and while many americans do not turn out at the polls it seems some illegals

that he has introduced to fund preparation for a possible pandemic flu outbreak and i thought it might be useful to come down to the floor and just review some of the reasons that scientists are concerned about this outbreak of avian flu in the world and some of the reasons why we need to be concerned and some of the reasons why we need to be prepared and some of the good news to share as well the influenza virus with which we are all familiar undergoes a continuous process of change it is constantly changing its genetics it drifts from one genetic makeup to another for the past several years the flu type known as h3n2 has been the type for which we commonly receive inoculations and because of this genetic drift a new inoculation is required each and every year with the absence of a flu vaccination last year i did not take a flu shot but there is still some immunity that carries over from year to year but about every 30 years there is a major change in the genetics of the flu virus these major changes took place during the last century in 1957 when 170 000 people in this country died from an outbreak of what was called asian flu and in 1968 when 35 000 people in this country died from the hong kong flu the term pandemic applies when there is a big big animal reservoir of the virus and no underlying immunity and those conditions exist today the assumptions and the knowledge of prior pandemics certainly have become part of the pandemic plan that was revealed by the department of health and human services last week but the important thing is the study of prior pandemics tells us that this virus if it were to achieve pandemic status could overwhelm almost all of the available resources that we would have at our disposal in this country not to mention what would happen in the rest of the world the virus that is under consideration for this pandemic the socalled h5n1 virus has some similarities with the spanish flu from the 1918 pandemic both of these illnesses cause lower respiratory tract symptoms high fever muscle aches and pains and extreme extreme fatigue that fatigue can persist for 6 8 10 weeks after recovery if the patient recovers from the illness that fatigue may persist for many many weeks thereafter and that of course could have implications for people returning to the workforce the virus can cause a primary or a secondary pneumonia the pulmonary tree is unable to clear itself of secretions and debris the vast majority do recover but the potential to kill is certainly related to the virulence of the microbe some of the trouble signs that are on the horizon things that have gotten the secretary of health and human services and the chairman of the committee on appropriations concerned some of the trouble signs include the wide geographic setting with involvement of not only birds but now other mammals birdtohuman transmission has occurred it has not been easy for the virus to go from bird to human but it has happened and it appears in some instances although it has not been an easy transmission there has been transmission from human to human if the virus undergoes that last step that allows it to have efficient humantohuman transition that is what would signify the onset of a worldwide pandemic it is also entirely possible and i do need to stress this that efficient humantohuman transition will never be developed and that the pandemic will never occur so the chairman is quite right we need to devote resources to this problem but we must also recognize that the problem that we are concerned about today may not be the problem that we face one of the very important aspects of the legislation that has been introduced by chairman lewis and legislation that will be taken up by my committee the energy and commerce committee is how do we facilitate the ramp up the surge capacity the production of antiviral or the production of antiviral vaccines if an entirely different virus or somewhat different virus from this avian flu is actually the one that causes the outbreak there are other antiviral medications available medications such as tamiflu and relenza have activity against the h5n1 virus and they are going to be one of our first lines of defense again some good news is that a vaccine has been developed afid it was developed in a relatively short period of time it was undergoing trials it appears to be safe one of the troubles though is since we have no underlying immunity to that virus it takes a lot of that vaccination for us to develop immunity some of the things we are going to have to consider and the chairman appropriately referred to these the federal government will have to share some of the risks with companies that are manufacturing the vaccines that means not only some of the liability risks but the risks of guaranteeing purchase of these products if they ramp up production and the pandemic does not materialize some guarantee of purchase will have to be there and to allow drug companies to communicate with each 6ther to discuss among themselves what are some of the techniques for producing some of these medications so perhaps some antitrust reform will have to be included in whatever our preparation and our response is to the flu i wanted to bring these facts to the floor tonight because i know this is important legislation that this house will

jury for attempting to solicit a minor over the internet notwithstanding the jurys verdict the unitedstates district judge dean whipple acquitted jan helder saying that he did not commit a crime because he was not communicating with a minor but in fact was communicating with an undercover agent posing as a minor judge whipple clearly ignored the laws intent and contradicted wellestablished case law addressing the issue in united states v jeffrey meek the ninth circuit court of appeals specifically addressed the question of whether a crime of attempting to solicit a minor on the internet applies when the actual victim is an adult rather than a minor in this case the court concurred with the decisions of the fifth and eleventh circuit courts in finding that an actual minor victim is

liability premiums were soaring not just because insurance carriers were discontinuing the sale of medical liability insurance but because too many physicians felt forced to leave their practice leave their specialty or leave the state for a more affordable state but 10 years ago in wisconsin we figured out a reasonable answer i led the fight to create a new medical liability system where injured parties receive every single dollar of economic damages to which they are entitled but where there is a modest cap on noneconomic damages things like pain and suffering loss of society loss of companionship you know what it worked we hear a lot about studies here we know as a fact in wisconsin it worked in a short period of time wisconsin became one of only six states not to have a medical liability crisis as a result as the state medical society reported physicians especially those in highrisk specialties actually moved into our state from states like ohio and pennsylvania and florida and illinois it worked but sadly my state recently lost its way even though by any reasonable measure our reforms work the wisconsin courts struck them down we can only hope that wisconsin enacts a new medical liability reform act but until then we should pass the health act it will not only help wisconsin doctors and patients but those in every state facing a medical liability crisis this bill is statefriendly it does not preempt state reforms if a state like wisconsin has a cap on noneconomic damages whether that cap is higher or lower that cap will take effect more important it is doctorfriendly it is patientfriendly it will help us get a handle on at least a small portion of our health care costs it will encourage doctors to continue to practice in vital specialties and it will attack defensive medicine i urge support for the health act"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a few weeks ago the unitedstates department of commerce reported that our nations real gross domestic product was

income and 26 million taxpayers realize capital gains i think that shows how little they know about employee ownership in america of so many companies where people work so to dismiss out of hand as if no one benefits from these provisions is absolutely false and not to mention the effect of these investment tax reductions on our economy and what that means for peoples individual lives and their prosperity i spent some time earlier going through a number of statistics about how we have record unemployment record homeownership record productivity and so many indicators of strength in our national economy that are as a result of the 2003 tax relief also the potential tax hike in investment taxes could already potentially be weighing on people about to retire the 70 million baby boomers who are about to retire and could weigh on investors as they make their longerterm investment decisions that is why it is so important that we continue the capital gains and dividend tax relief in reconciliation that we dont have a tax hike on investment taxes because that would hurt the economic growth that we have been able to achieve in recent years let me just say that we have been able to do both in our legislation both capital gains and middleincome amt and they have been done within the budget the congressionally approved budget by this congress allows up to 70 billion in

come here and expect a handout and a free ride and now americans they are speaking out recently taxpayers in houston forked out over 125 million in hospital costs in just 1 year by treating more than 53 000 illegals taking advantage of the system in our hospitals taking advantage of americans and really taking advantage of legal immigrants it is morally wrong for illegals to enter this country with the expectation that they will live off of others it is morally wrong for them to expect that americans will pay to take care of them take care of their health costs their education costs and their social services costs but now it is becoming illegal for illegals to get these services that even many americans do not receive taxpayers are finding their own answers while some federal lawmakers in washington remain deaf to their desire because they are too busy dueling over illegal immigration doctrines state leaders are stepping in across the couhtry just this week in colorado lawmakers took a cue from their citizens by cutting through the conflict and passed 11 bipartisan bills taking a tougher stance on illegal entry just like houston illegals have been drawn to colorado like moths to a flame and like many states colorado has left the porch light on for them because they have bad laws that encourage illegal entry such as laws that protect employers that hire illegals providing illegals benefits that many americans do not receive such as unemployment grants and even medical care this may explain why half of colorados immigrants are illegal but those days may be over because now state legislators are aiming to flip the switch and turn out the lights and turn off the benefits that make being illegal so lucrative this week they passed 11 immigration bills including making people prove that they are legal residents of colorado in order to receive state and federal benefits that is a farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom line those businesses who exploit illegals make a profit off of cheap labor but americans pick up the tab for all social services now they are going to lose a grip on that filthy lucre that they have gotten businesses that exploit those already living in the shadows of our society beyond the scope of federal work and wage regulations it will cost those illicit businesses money in the form of fines if they do not keep records proving that they hire only legal residents and while many americans do not turn out at the polls it seems some illegals find some way to vote in this country and now it is going to be a felony if they do so and while colorado legislators have been hard at work they are letting the voters make the really tough decisions they are asking them in november on the ballot if they should sue the federal government for not enforcing federal immigration laws voters will also be asked to deny tax benefits to business owners who hire illegals each day my office gets inundated with calls emails and faxes of people demanding

participating countries ive long been a supporter of teach for america and it is worth noting that a highly regarded study by mathematica policy research showed that students taught by teach for america corps made greater gains than those of veteran fully certified teachers as the unitedstates economy becomes even more reliant on workers with greater knowledge and technological expertise it
