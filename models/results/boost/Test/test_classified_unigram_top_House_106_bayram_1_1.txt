more decentralized approach where local school districts are able to innovate each further at a more local level some states are a little more centrally controlled at their state capitals but in no

knows passed a budget here in the house of representatives where we made a very strong commitment to veterans health care the president proposed a budget that basically flatlined it there was no increase in veterans health care and congress recognizing the importance of living up to the commitments that we have made to our veterans increased the funding by about 1 7 billion i have a few letters from folks in montana veterans health care is a pretty interesting issue in montana one of the interesting aspects of the montana experience in world war ii is that there is a larger proportion of montanas population that served in world war ii than any other state in the country that had a lot to do with the census during the 1930s montana lost a lot of population and the allocation of forces and the draft quotas were based upon population numbers that predated 1940 so montanans sent more men and women to fight in world war ii than other states did proportionately so as a consequence of that we have a larger proportion of veterans and of course we have a very large state also to deal with they just recently closed a veterans facility in miles city a veterans hospital in miles city in fact one veteran wrote to me and said im wondering what message you are trying to send to us you expanded the veterans cemetery and you closed the veterans hospital does that tell us that you have something in mind for the world war ii and korean war veterans in any event this congress has approved a budget that will increase spending to provide health care to veterans and it is extremely important that we live up to the commitment that we made to these disabled veterans and other senior citizens who are veterans who need to secure their health care budgets are about more than numbers budgets are about priorities and the budget that we just passed i think is an important one because i think it tells the american people what our priorities are for the future of america and i want to just outline again what those are i talked briefly for a few minutes about increasing spending for veterans health care but also we included in our budget a provision to set aside all of the social security taxes that are collected for social security which is something that is unique congress has not done that over the last 20 years the surpluses coming from social security as i know most of my colleagues know has been spent on other things we established a milestone we say from now forward all of the social security taxes 100 percent will be set aside to save social security we also want to strengthen our national defense i think it is obvious to everyone who is paying attention to the situation in kosovo the war in kosovo it is obvious that our military is strapped to the absolute limit we cannot fly many of our airplanes we are running short of armaments it is clear we have inadequate training or insufficient training in many cases that our men and women are being stretched to the limit and perhaps beyond it we need to put more resources to the national defense also as part of this budget there is a plan to lower taxes on the american people i think it is important for us to have some discussion about why it is important for us to lower taxes for the american people the portion of our national income today that is going to taxes to the burden of taxes of the federal government is the third highest it has ever been in the national history in fact the only time the percentage of our national income was higher going to taxes was in world war ii in 1945 and 1946 so it is a simple matter of fairness that the tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden on american families i think it is really important that we talk about and have a clear debate about where we think we ought to reduce taxes there are two areas i think that are particularly important one is eliminating the marriage penalty i think it is grossly unfair that 70 000 of my constituents in montana pay on average 1 400 more in taxes because they are married than if they were single i also believe that we need to do something about the estate tax there is not a tax that is more unfair than the estate tax the fact that we tax somebody simply because they die seems to me to be extraordinarily unfair while it is often perceived as a tax on the rich the very wealthy do not pay that tax it is working men and women small business owners and people who have saved and have been prudent with their money farmers and ranchers particularly are hard hit by the death tax we just passed on may 8 tax freedom day the american people have been working all year long until may 8 to support government now they get to work for their families one of the ways we can help them live up to the responsibilities of their families be able to provide for their families is by reducing taxes we did that in the last congress we passed the 400 per child tax credit it will go to 500 this year it is surprising how many montanans have written to me thanking me for that 400 per child tax credit saying that that is going to allow them to be able to spend more money on education for their children or perhaps even clothing or food or the necessities of the family or even maybe a family vacation but montanans are grateful for that incidentally that is 50 million more that will be made available to the citizens of montana to spend in montana which will of course strengthen the economy of the state of montana so many montanans write to me and say that both the husband and the wife have to work in order to support their family or a woman might even write and say that her husband has two jobs a fulltime job and a parttime job just to support the family forty percent of that income is going to the government that is too high of a percentage we ought to be 20 or 25 percent total going to government and the best way to do that is a downpayment

some demographic groups that rate is as high as 70 percent tonight one in four american children that go to bed will go to bed in a home in which their father does not reside times have certainly changed in 1960 more than 80 percent of americas children lived with both of their parents in a home where both parents were married in the last census that number dropped to 57 7 percent when a family breaks apart in divorce children most often live with their mother the effects of growing up without a father are becoming clear according to the 1996 gallup poll 79 1 percent of americans feel and i quote the most significant family or social problem facing america is the physical absence of the father from the home i will never forget hearing the famous psychiatrist dr armond nicoli speak about fathers and the importance of spending time with their children he had done a study of the fathers in the 128 corridor around boston and actually calculated the amount of time in minutes that a father spent with his children today and compared that with fathers in russia and he made this point he said some people say well i do not spend a lot of time with my children but the time i spend is quality time and then he said you know quality of time like the quality of air and oxygen is very important but the lack of it will kill you it is important that we spend time and spend a good amount of time with our children what role does a father play in a home well i am sure we all have our own stories and mine is not necessarily right but some of the things i used to try to do is i spent 3 days a week in the state capitol away from my children and every night i would get them on the phone and talk to each one of them on the phone i would schedule breakfast every quarter every third month with each of them individually out in a restaurant with them to listen to them to talk to them it was a wonderful time and my kids are all grown they still like to have breakfast with me i still send them each a letter every month there are lots of different kinds of things that we can do as fan ilies we can read to them every evening there are so many times and things that we can do to express our love and spend our time with our children some men perhaps make better fathers than others i suppose but clearly overall children with two parents are greatly benefitted by it thank god for our single parents and our single moms but they need help and studies show that even in a high crime or an innercity neighborhood well over 90 percent of children from safe stable two parent homes do not become delinquents children with fathers at hdme tend to do better in school they are less prone to depression and they have more successful relationships the national fatherhood initiative founded by dr wade horn and don eberly frommy district have helped to stem the tide of children being raised in homes without fathers dr horn tells us that when the national fatherhood initiative was founded the topic of fatherhood was still not considered an issue of national significance the first and the most important task that nf1 set out to accomplish was to stimulate a broadbased societywide social movement on behalf of involved committed responsible fatherhood the national fatherhood initiative is doing a very effective job i think and celebrities like tom selleck james earl jones tiger woods and his father earl general colin powell coach joe paterno have all lent their names and efforts to this cause i along with several other members in congress have come together to form this task force on fatherhood promotion trying to raise the profile of the issue by legislative have means and the nfi has been very successful thousands of communitybased grassroots programs designed to provide support skills encouragement to fathers have sprung up all over the country dozens of governors have held fatherhood conferences fatherlessness isgetting theattention that it finally deserves according to the 1996 gallup poll 90 9 percent of parents believe it is important for children to live in a home with both father and mother this resolution recognizes that the creation of a better country depends in large part on the active involvement of both parents fathers in helping rearing and developing their children this resolution urges each father in america to accept his full share of responsibility for the lives of his children to be actively involved in rearing his children to encourage the academic moral spiritual development of his children this resolution urges governments and institutions at every level to remove barriers to father involvement to enact public policies that are father friendly that encourage and support the efforts of fathers who want to become more engaged in the lives of their children it encourages each father to devote time energy and resources to his children recognizing that children need not only material support but also more importantly a secure and nurturing family environment finally this resolution expresses our support for the national fatherhood initiative its work to inspire and equip fathers

advancements we have got to do something about these outrageous prices that have snuck in here for example i do not know why the democrat from new jersey instead of up here bashing and misleading all of you by saying that the republicans the leadership have planned this cruel hoax on the americans really honestly is there anybody you have ever met in elective office that wants to go out and play a cruel hoax on the constituents they represent is that an exaggeration of course it is an exaggeration but the fact that we come back to is this what do we do to bring the pharmaceutical prices into line without bringing in nationalized health care the democrats are very easy to stand up here in front of you ladies and gentlemen and stand in front of my colleagues and promise you the moon the magic cure greener fields on the other side of the fence all i am saying is before you jump on the other side of the fence take a look at the consequences of the plan that they are proposing where do you think al gore the vice president is going to get his money from this it comes out of that surplus remember this is the first time in 30 years we have had that surplus as i say clearly there is a problem out there we need to address that problem but the gore approach and the democratic congress approach or at least the liberal side of it i have got to say i have got to restrain myself because we have several conservative democrats who do not agree with the liberal approach as just espoused by the gentleman from new jersey but the liberal democratic approach is the hillary clinton approach nationalized health care socialized health care i can tell a lot of you right now 64 percent of the people in america as i understand have some kind of prescription care service you better figure out what the gentleman from new jersey is proposing to do with the service of those of you that have prescription care in moving that to the people that do not have prescription care service there are lots of consequences to what the democrats the liberal democrats are proposing when they offer you something for nothing there is a price to be paid and i think it is incumbent upon the gentleman from new jersey and his colleagues when they stand up here and trash and cut down more conservative democrats or the conservative republicans i think it is incumbent on them to kind of have an openness requirement tell the people what the consequences are of nationalized health care tell people what the consequences are of a canadiantype of system talk about it tell the people what the consequences are of research for better medicines know this is why this congress just does not jump up and sign the blank check offered by the gentleman fromnew jersey we are not going to jump up and sign a blank check at least enough of us on both sides of the aisle are saying wait a minute what are we doing what are the consequences clearly we all agree on the problem despite what the gentleman from new jersey says nobody is patting the pharmaceutical companies on the back and saying be proud of yourself they have not done a good job in some regards with medicine but frankly it appears that there is some gouging going on out there but before my colleagues addressthat problem take a very careful look at what the democrat the liberal democrat approach is because i can assure my colleagues in the long run first of all they promise it will only be 10 percent of the surplus and a much much smaller percent of the budget and nothing will grow and grow and grow and it is the open door for socialized medicine in this country for a national health care and there are a lot of people who in my opinion will suffer under a national health care plan nobody should be forgotten and nobody should be left behind but there are ways to address that without going into a hillary clintontype of health care plan so my discussion here tonight was not intended to be on health care but there is nobody else that stands here to rebut these gentlemen as they speak here unrebutted for 1 hour about the socalled quote cruel hoaxes by the republican leadership those words ought to be stricken from the record they are inaccurate they are misleading the gentleman from new jersey and some of his colleagues they know that the cruel hoax by the leadership i did not say there is a cruel hoax by the democratic leadership come on we have more protocol on this floor we can be more ladies and gentlemen in talking about the problem the people that suffer while this partisan bickering goes on back here are the senior citizens that do not have prescription care or by the way anybody that does not have the ability to care for themselves but do not address it by waving the magic wand and saying look citizens we have got something for nothing we are going to take care of all of your health care needs we are going to take away your personal responsibility and the government is going to assume it remember every time and i cannot say this strong enough every time the government assumes one of your responsibilities every time the government takes a burden of yours and makes it a burden of theirs they take something with it it comes with a price somewhere we are losing a freedom somewhere we are going to lose the ability to have choice in the future so in summary on this health care plan let me say i am discouraged by the comments that were made previous to my speaking here this evening we do not get anywhere and i direct my remarks at the liberal democrats look we are not going to get anywhere with a nationalized health care plan we are not going to get anywhere with socialized medicine why do you not sit down instead of talking about how leadership has this cruel conspiracy going on by throwing a few bucks at insurance companies why do you not put the electionyear rhetoric aside and sit down with us and help us try and figure out what a solution is every day that we use that kind of rhetoric there are people out there who are suffering because my colleagues are not willing to sit down and put their heads together to come up with a solution and there is a solution i am optimistic that we can have a solution we do have a great country and we have made wonderful strides in health care but clearly we have got some problems in that system but we can fix it without having our health care provided by the united states of america which means they are going to oversee what doctors you see they are going to oversee what kind of prescriptions you get they are going to oversee what kind of treatments you get they are going to oversee how often you are going to get to see this doctor or that doctor socialized or national medicine is not the magic answer it appears to be tonight it is very easy to buy into this very easy to buy into this because the democrats the liberal side over here not all democrats i stand corrected the liberal democrats over here they think you are going to get something for nothing and they are saying look it is easy for us to afford it no problem remember you do not get something for nothing let me switch subjects and talk about something much much more pertinent i think really because of the olympics i hope some of you have are having the opportunity to watch it in fact i was over at the office before i came over this evening watching the olympics how exciting that is even if it is taped nbc or whoever does that the reality of it is look what we get to see clear across the ocean in sydney and watch those olympics and i am very proud of those people i want to tell you i heard an advertisement i will not tell you the name of the company the other day but i heard an advertisement about the olympics and it said our young men and women that go over there to compete in the olympics they will come home heroes and i thought to myself you know they will come over celebrities i would like to have their autographs i am proud of them but i think using the word heroes is somewhat of a delusion i think the real word of heroes is used in a different type of setting there are sports celebrities and there are heroes i have a perfect example i am not just up here talking without giving you an example it is happening this week in pueblo colorado first of all on my way over i real quickly grabbed a dictionary and i looked up the word hero hero a mythological or a legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability an illustrious warrior a man admired for his noble qualities one that shows great courage an object of extreme admiration and devotion with courage with that said let me read an editorial from one of the leading newspapers in the state of colorado the pueblo chieftain it is called patriots week what is patriots week about this is a celebration of heroes this week we anticipate more than 110 americans more than 110 americans who have been decorated with the medal of honor which is the highest honor our country can give out 110 bf them will be in pueblo colorado to be honored by a city which was recently designated as one of the four finest communities to live in this country pueblo colorado picked out of hundreds of communities it was picked in the top four this week pueblo is hosting 110 medal of honor winners and they are calling their week patriots week i am going to go through my poster here in a few minutes with you and show you some of the interesting things about what this week is going to consist of first of all let me read the editorial out of the sunday chieftain star and journal my good friend bob rawlings who is the publisher and editor this is patriots week the home of heroes in pueblo colorado on tuesday the national medal of honor society convenes here for its annual convention pueblo is home to four medal of honor recipients the most of any city at least in modern times on thursday largerthanlife bronze sculptures of the four puebloans who won this will be unveiled at the pueblo convention center they are carl sitter william crawford drew dix and jerry murphy mr sitter and mr crawford died this year but not before they got to see their sculptures taking form also included is a display of all medal of honor recipients dating back to the civil war when the nations highest honor was approved by the united states congress a black tie patriot dinner on friday will bring five greats from the world of sports to pueblo golfer arnold palmer gold glove baseball player brooks robinson nba center david the admiral robinson onetime boxing champion gene fullmer and the nhl hockey star pat lafontaine will receive the societys patriot award for the joy and support they have given to our military forces also commentator paul harvey and world war ii cartoonist bill maudlin will receive special awards from the medal of honor society two other veterans organizations are in pueblo this in week in conjunction with the societys convention two days ago the 50th anniversary reunion of the 578th combat engineering battalion began later this year the crew of the peachy a b29 piloted by puebloan bill haver that flew raids over japan will meet for its annual gettogether mr haver named the plane a replica of which is at the aircraft museum at the memorial airport in honor of his sister peachy wilcoxson and i know peachy today is constitution day all of these patriots spot for the ideals embodied in the united states constitution and many of their comrades perished in that effort so let each and every one of us reflect on that remarkable document and rededicate ourselves to the cause of liberty and justice well how exciting in pueblo alone for example i would like to just to kind of for a moment go over who are the four members who are from pueblo colorado as i mentioned in my comments unfortunately two of our members two of our citizens of pueblo passed away earlier this year mr crawford who was in the army you can see right here and mr sitter right here but we still have surviving drew dix the gentleman right here with the red dot and jerry murphy who was in the marines in korea this is the plaza that pueblo colorado has dedicated and put together through contributions from the local community here is a community that came together did not come to the united states congress and ask for money did not expect the government to do it they got together in their community of pueblo colorado to honor all medal of honor recipients but specifically to put something that will be a longlasting recognition of the four medal of honor winners from pueblo colorado that is what that little plaza is going to look like the statues here is one of jerry murphy 82 feet tall that is the completed statute there honoring jerry here so you have an idea there is bill crawford before he passed away as he stands with the statue of him which is also about 81 2 feet high this is going to be an exciting week in pueblo what i thought i would do is share with my colleagues four of the stories of these medal of honor winners i can tell you that i have had the occasion and i consider it amongst the highest privileges of my congressional career if i were to kind of recapture my memories of serving in the united states congress where i felt the most fortunate to meet somebody or the most privileged to be able to shake their hand i would have to put it in the order of i am catholic the pope and mother theresa and right behind them our medal of honor winners in fact i was in a parade in pueblo not very long ago and i had the opportunity in that parade to shake the hands of two medal of honor winners who were watching the parade you feel so much pride because these people are such heroes they really are what heros are the word they do not cause any delusion to the word hero h7715 they embody hero in its fullest envisions let me talk about drew dix i will point out drew here drew right here by the way a special hello to his mother a very sweet person in pueblo colorado let me talk a little about drew drew d dix unitedstates army special forces vietnam citation for conspicuous gallantry in the action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty sergeant dix distinguished himself by exceptional heroism by serving as a unit advisor to heavily armed vietcong battalions attacked the providence capital of chau phu resulting in complete breakdown and fragmentation of defenses of the city sergeant dix with a patrol of vietnamese soldiers was recalled to assist in the defense of the city learning that a nurse was trapped in a house near the center of the city sergeant dix organized a relief force successfully rescued the nurse and returned her safely to the tackle operations ceiter but that is not all being informed that now there were other trapped civilians within the city sergeant dix voluntarily led another force to rescue eight civilian employees located in a building which was under heavy mortar and small arms fire sergeant dix then returned to the center of the city upon approaching a building he was subjected to intense automatic rifle and machine gun fire from an unknown number of vietcong he personally assaulted the building killing six of the vietcong and rescuing two philippinos the following day sergeant dix still onhis own volition assembled a 20man force and though under intense enemy fire cleared the vietcong out of the hotel the theater and other adjacent buildings within the city during this portion of the attack army republic of vietnam soldiers inspired by the heroism and success of sergeant dix rallied and commenced firing upon the viet cong sergeant dix individually captured 20 prisoners including a high ranking viet cong official he then attacked enemy troops who had entered the residence of the deputy providence chief and was successful in rescuing the officials wife and children sergeant dixs personal heroic actions resulted in 14 confirmed viet cong killed in action and possibly 25 more the capture of 20 prisoners 15 weapons and the rescue of 14 united states and free world civilians the heroism of sergeant dix was in the highest tradition and reflects great credit upon the united states army raymond jerry murphy and if you ever go to pueblo colorado you will see murphy boulevard i mean these guys are real heroes their community loves them our country has deep respect for medal of honor winners excuse me not winners they did not win it medal of honor recipients and i stand corrected on that raymond jerry murphy united states marine corps korea citation for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as a platoon commander of company a an action against enemy aggressor forces although painfully wounded by fragments froman enemy mortar shell while leading his evacuation platoon in support of assault units attacking a cleverly concealed and wellentrenched hostile force occupying commanding ground second lieutenant murphy steadfastly refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small arms fire skillfully maneuvering his force from one position to the next and shouting words of encouragement undeterred by the increasing intense enemy fire he immediately located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire swept hill to direct evacuation teams to the wounded personally carrying many of the stricken marines to safety when reinforcements were needed by the assaulting elements second lieutenant murphy employed part of his unit as support and during the ensuing battle personally killed two of the enemy with his own pistol with all of the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units beginning to disengage he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of friendly forces of the hill and although suffering intense pain from his previous wounds he seized an automatic rifle to provide more firepower when the enemy reappeared from the trenches after reaching the base of the hill he organized a search party and again ascended the slope for a final check on missing marines locating and carrying the bodies of machine gun crew back down the hill wounded a second time while conducting the entire force to the line of departure through a continuing barrage of enemy small arms artillery and mortar fire he again refused medical assistance until assured that every one of his men including all of the casualties had preceded him to the main lines his resolute and inspiring leadership and exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon second lieutenant murphy and enhance the finest traditions of the united states marine corps william crawford our third pueblo citizen united states army world war ii for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of life and above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy in italy 13 september 1943 whencompany i attacked an enemyheld position on hill 424 the third platoon in which private crawford was a squad scout attacked as a base platoon for the company after reaching the crest of the hill the platoon was pinned down by intense enemy machine and small arms fire locating one of these guns which was dug in on a terrace on his immediate front private crawford without orders and on his own initiative moved over the hill under enemy fire to a point within a few yards of the machine gun emplacement and singlehandedly destroyed the machine gun and killed three of the crew with a hand grenade thus enabling his platoon to continue its advance when the platoon after reaching the crest was once more delayed by enemy fire private crawford again in face of intense fire and on his own volition advanced directly to the front midway between two hostile two this time hostile machine gun nests located on a higher terrace and placed in a small ravine moving first to the left with a hand grenade he destroyed one gun emplacement and killed the crew then he worked his way to the right and under continuous fire from the other machine gun emplacement he used one hand grenade and the use of his rifle and he killed one enemy and blew out the machine gun nest and forced the remainder of the enemy to flee seizing the enemy machine gun that was left from the one emplacement he fired on the withdrawing germans and facilitating his companys advance these are remarkable individuals carl sitter united states marine corps korea for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as a commanding officer of company g in action against enemy aggressor forces ordered to break through enemy infested territory to reinforce his battalion the morning of 29 november captain sitter continuously exposed himself to enemy fire as he led his company forward and despite 25 percent casualties suffered in the furious action he succeeded in driving the group to its objective assuming the responsibility of attempting to seize and occupy a strategic area occupied by a hostile force of regiment strength deeply entrenched on a snow covered hill commanding the entire valley southeast of town as well as the line of march of friendly troops withdrawing to the south he reorganized his depleted units the following morning and boldly led them up that steep frozen hillside under blistering fire encouraging and redeploying his troops as casualties occurred and directing forward platoons as they continued the drive to the top of the ridge during the night when the vastly outnumbered enemy launched a sudden vicious counterattack setting the hill ablaze with mortar machinegun and automatic weapons fire and taking a heavy toll in troops captain sitter visited each foxhole and gun position coolly deploying and integrating reinforcing units consisting of service personnel unfamiliar with infantry tactics into a coordinated combat team and instilling in every man the will and determination to hold his position at all costs with the enemy penetrating his lines in repeated counterattacks which often required handtohand combat and on one occasion infiltrating to the command post with hand grenades he fought gallantly with his men in repulsing and killing the fanatic attackers in each encounter painfully wounded in the face wounded in the arms and wounded in the chest by bursting grenades he staunchly refused to be evacuated and he continued to fight on until a successful defense of the area was assured with a loss of the enemy by more than 50 percent of their troops dead or wounded or captured his valiant leadership superb tactics and great personal valor throughout 36 hours of bitter combat reflect the highest credit upon captain sitter and the unitedstates naval service these four gentlemen that i just described as heroes who got the medal of honor are from pueblo colorado but i want to remind all of my colleagues there is what we call the medal of honor society and 110 members of that society will be in pueblo colorado this week to be honored by our community and to be honored by our nation for what they have done those four stories i told are but a drop in the bucket of the stories of valor the stories of courageous brave men and women who stepped out above the call of duty because they believed in america they believed in freedom and they were willing to lay their life down for it this weekend i had a wonderful opportunity to spend with my wife and my parents in meeker colorado and we were up at the cemetery an old cemetery we were in the old section of the cemetery and i walked by a grave and it was a young man not much on the gravestone had the gentlemens name had his birth he was 22 years old and all it said on the gravestone was he died for his country as we know we have thousands and thousands and thousands of men and women in this country who have died for their country and we have hundreds of thousands of men and women who have fought bravely for what this country stands for for the freedom of this country for the benefit of all of us we cannot acknowledge everybody with a medal of honor so we know that there are brave and courageous individuals out there who should have received the medal of honor who earned the medal of honor but did not receive it but we do know we still have a group of individuals who did receive the medal of honor and they truly should own lock stock and barrel the title of hero"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "tonight we are going to talk about an issue which i suspect most of our colleagues and anyone else who might be watching on cspan tonight would say how in the world can the issue of milk be a controversial issue i think if they pay any attention tonight they will find that milk is an enormously controversial issue particularly for those of us in the upper midwest it is a very difficult issue i think for the average person to completely understand and we hope that we do not bore our colleagues who may be watching tonight it is a little like the story of the little boy who came in and asked his mother a question his mother was kind of busy and she said well why dont you ask your dad the little boy said well i didnt want to know that much about it i suspect a lot of people who may tune in tonight may say well i did riot want to know that much about milk policy here in the united states to start off though i think we have to kind of look at this chart and begin to understand the history first of all let me say that this is june it is dairy month some people know that a lot of people do not know that but june is dairy month for a very interesting reason back in the thirties farmers recognized that in june we reach what is called the peak of the spring flush that is when dairy cows produce the most amount of milk they are going to produce all year at the same time schools get out a lot of kids go home they drink less milk more soft drinks more lemonade and so forth and so at the very time milk production goes to its peak consumption drops back in the thirties the chain drugstore association got together with the dairy association and had the first dairy month now it has become a very big event particularly in the upper midwest and we encourage people all over the country to enjoy milk but more importantly cheese and cottage cheese and yogurt ice cream all the other things made from the real thing dairy products real cheese real milk back in the thirties we were suffering from some rather difficult financial circumstances for all americans but for farmers in particular and they came up with a rather convoluted system back in 1937 as part of the agricultural marketing agreement in 1937 to create various regions around the country and price milk based on where it came from and what it went into we are going to talk about this whole issue a little bit tonight but i want to talk about the disparities that this system is creating this is the 1998 average blend prices for current federal milk marketing orders what it demonstrates and i think the numbers may be too small to really pick up on the television screen so any of the members who may be watching in their offices who would like a smaller version of this so that they can actually look at it and read the numbers i am going to read some of them for you but in effect what we have is a system where milk is priced to the dairy farmer based on what it goes into and where it comes from now this may seem bizarre but in 1937 eau claire wisconsin was considered the epicenter of the dairy production area in the united states anybody who has ever watched a green bay packers game understands that there is an awful lot of cheese produced in wisconsin there is also a lot of cheese produced in my district as a matter of fact there is one cheese plant in my district that produces 500 000 pounds of cheese every single day that is a lot of cheese and of course we cannot eat all of that cheese in the upper midwest but what they did is they created this system because they decided that eau claire wisconsin was the epicenter of the dairy production area for the united states they said the closer you are to eau claire wisconsin the less you will get for your milk because of all the cheese plants and because back in 1937 we did not have the interstate highway system and refrigerated trucks it probably made some sense back in 1937 to have a system so that it would encourage production in places like texas los angeles the pacific northwest particularly out here in the populated areas of the eastern seaboard boston new york washington they wanted to encourage more dairy production in those areas relative to wisconsin minnesota northern illinois and iowa so they came up with this rather convoluted system which may have made some sense in 1937 but guess what since 1937 we built the interstate highway system we have refrigerated trucks that can now get milk almost anywhere in the united states within a matter of a few days while the milk is still absolutely fresh delicious and wonderful to enjoy but we still have the system it is interesting once you create a federal government program in fact mark twain once observed the most permanent thing on earth is a temporary government program back in 1937 they created this system and to give you some of the numbers that are shown on this chart to kind of give you an idea of the differences the average blended price for the upper midwest including minnesota most of wisconsin the eastern dakotas part of northern iowa and i think it actually gets into northern illinois the average blended price last year that was paid to dairy farmers was 13 57 per hundred pounds of milk now that is another thing most people do not understand the dairy farmer always receives his milk check based on the number of hundreds of pounds of milk so the average dairy farmer in the upper midwest got 13 57 that was what the federal government mandated mandated is an important word we are going to talk about that a little bit now if you were a dairy farmer for example in washington or oregon the federal government mandated a price of 14 75 if you were in central arizona that price was 14 90 but if you lived down here in the southeast one of the states that produced milk for example in southern tennessee mississippi alabama georgia that dairy farmer got 16 13 mandated by the federal government if you lived in southern florida for example down in the tampa bay region your price was 16 82 the differential 13 57 if you live in my district or wisconsin or parts of illinois 13 57 but if you are down in florida it is 16 82 again that may have made sense back in 1937 when we did not have the interstate highway system did not have refrigerated trucks but it does not make a whole lot of sense today so we are here tonight to talk about this and sort of raise some of the questions rhetorical questions and ask if anybody can honestly defend a system that says to dairy farmers that your product will be based on where it comes from and what it goes into incidentally to make things even more complicated yes milk is priced based on what it goes into if your milk goes into fluid milk the stuff that comes in containers that you drink and everybody loves good for your body gives you a white mustache if it goes into fluid milk it is worth more than if it is going into what is called class 2 milk which is spoonable that would include ice cream cottage cheese yogurt class 3 milk is products like cheese and butter class 4 milk is powdered milk so we have four classes of milk and again that determines the price that the dairy farmer gets that does all of the work that gets up every morning at 5 oclock in the morning because cows have to be milked at least twice a day this is not a job for the faint of heart anybody who wants to go into the dairy business see me because there are lots of people looking for folks who want to get up at 5 oclock every single morning 365 days a year and milk those cows that is what they have to do but the real problem is if you live in minnesota wisconsin what we call the upper midwest region the eastern dakotas you get 13 57 if you live in southern florida you get 16 82 now is it any wonder that some of our producers in the upper midwest say this is not fair it is absolutely not fair that is a system that we hope to change i started this conversation tonight by saying you would not think that milk is a particularly controversial issue well it is because believe it or not the people in florida think this is a pretty good system what is wrong with the system that pays our dairy farmers 16 82 in fact i am in my third term in congress i have learned in those three terms that whenever you talk about leveling the playing field you can always bet that at least half of the people participating in that debate do not want to level the playing field why because relatively speaking their constituents lose well the point that we have been making in the upper midwest since 1937 now let me do a little arithmetic it is now 1999 less 37 that amounts to what 62 years for 62 years the dairy farmers in our region have been receiving less money relative to dairy farmers in anywhere else in the united states so for 62 years we have been saying it is time to level the playing field i have got another chart here and again if anyone would like a copy of these charts we would be more than happy to send them out if you contact my office we will send them to you but this gives some idea of the producer class 1 blended price benefit a regional average it shows how the differences work out between the northeast the average what the average is in the appalachian region florida for example as i mentioned you can see by this bar chart florida receives the best of all the deals and unfortunately the region that we represent is down here way at the bottom again we are not asking for special privileges we are not asking for special favors but we are asking in the day and age when we have the interstate highway system we have refrigerated trucks all we are asking is for equal pay for equal milk i have joining me tonight a couple of my colleagues one from illinois and one from the state of wisconsin and i want to yield some time to my colleague a freshman member the gentleman from wisconsin from i believe the first congressional district i represent the first congressional district in minnesota the gentleman from wisconsin represents the first congressional district in wisconsin i wonder if you want to talk a little bit about this and what the dairy farmers are talking about and ultimately the unfairness of the system we have"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today i rise in strong support of s 2425 the bend feed canal pipeline project act of 2000 thvis bill was sponsored in the senate by my good friend senator smith of oregon and i sponsored the companion legislation in the house s 2425 would authorize the bureau of reclamation to participate in the planning design and construction of the bend feed canal pipeline project in oregon the bend feed canal is built on pumice and other porous volcanic rock because of the porous rock over 20 cubic feet per second of water is lost over the length of the bend feed canal this loss causes the tumalo irrigation district district to use all available water and in drought years even that is not enough to supply the needs of its irrigators the existing bend feed canal has several segments currently piped this creates a dangerous situation as a person falling into an open section of the canal will soon find themselves approaching a piped section which would mean almost certain death although the beginning of each piped section has a trash rack with the urbanization of bend and the development around the bend feed canal the risk to small children is great this legislation will allow the district to replace six segments of open canal with pipeline in addition to the water conservation benefits once the project is complete the district will have increased system reliability and the customers in the area will have fewer safety concerns this is a very important step for a once largely rural community that is experiencing rapid growth the bend feed canal pipeline project act of 2000 is supported by the tumalo irrigation district and the oregon

are or seem to be by an independent panel review panel they still under erisa law cannot change the fact that a health plan could define medical necessity as the cheapest least expensive care we could take a little boy with a cleft palate a health plan could say all we are going to provide treatment for that is a plastic obturator a piece of plastic stuck up into that hole if that is the way the plans employer has defined medical necessity there is no recourse even if it does not fit any prescribed standards of care that is such a fundamental problem that is not addressed in the boehner bill

bill ought to be allowed to stand notwithstanding the fact that other provisions are declared unconstitutional is exactly why we are where we are today because back in the 1970s they attempted to use the model and we have heard this phrase repeatedly on the floor that we want to stop corruption or the appearance of corruption the court i think quite properly looked at contribution limits and said if we limit the amount that someone was given it certainly could be plausible that the limit was there to stop corruption or the appearance of corruption but in no way should it extend to the expenditure of money how does spending money corrupt the court then took that same logic and applied it to individuals who spent their own money and a key portion of shaysmeehan that we have been

i hope our colleagues will ponder that we frankly do not look to the unitedstates department of education the federal government to define the terms of quality in education across the country we do have 50 individual states each a laboratory in and of themselves and each that we see is free to be innovative to weigh the risks of new programs and new ideas against the successful models and the record of their 49 counterparts and colleagues throughout the rest of the country and states are in a better position to act more swiftly than the federal government is states are closer to the people the elected officials are much more accountable than the bureaucrats down the street here from where we are here at the unitedstates department of education that is the front line the states are the front lines of education reform and states differ some states have a more decentralized approach where local school districts are able to innovate each further at a more local level some states are a little more centrally controlled at their state capitals but in no case should we ever not be willing to trust the future of our children and their ability to grow intellectually to a small group of folks here in washington d c over at the department of education whose goal today facilitated by this centralized governing types down at todays white house to collect this authority and power in washington d c to define the terms of quality to define how a dollar will be spent in a classroom and of course with the track record of the unitedstates department of education it is the last organization we should trust to get the nations precious resources and tax dollars to the children that we ultimately care about most this is an important topic for the whole country the usa today newspaper i do not have the date on here it was just a few days ago and i ripped this out of the bottom of the newspaper this is a survey among web users and the top five problems in our society according to a survey of internet users and of the people that they surveyed on the internet 37 7 percent identified education as the number one priority i contrast that with again five priorities total the next one was government intrusion into peoples lives that was down at 10 2 percent then you have crime political corruption and rising health care costs which trail just a few percents behind that but given the huge number of individuals that responded an overwhelming majority identified education as their top priority we are hearing this around the country that parents care about how much money they are spending on taxes they care about the corruption and the lack of integrity we have seen in the white house over the last 8 years they care about a strong national defense they care about foreign policy they care about the environment and health care and all the rest but education repeatedly as a topic comes up as the number one concern among the people we speak with and

health care the president proposed a budget that basically flatlined it there was no increase in veterans health care and congress recognizing the importance of living up to the commitments that we have made to our veterans increased the funding by about 1 7 billion i have a few letters from folks in montana veterans health care is a pretty interesting issue in montana one of the interesting aspects of the montana experience in world war ii is that there is a larger proportion of montanas population that served in world war ii than any other state in the country that had a lot to do with the census during the 1930s montana lost a lot of population and the allocation of forces and the draft quotas were based upon population numbers that predated 1940 so montanans sent more men and women to fight in world war ii than other states did proportionately so as a consequence of that we have a larger proportion of veterans and of course we have a very large state also to deal with they just recently closed a veterans facility in miles city a veterans hospital in miles city in fact one veteran wrote to me and said im wondering what message you are trying to send to us you expanded the veterans cemetery and you closed the veterans hospital does that tell us that you have something in mind for the world war ii and korean war veterans in any event this congress has approved a budget that will increase spending to provide health care to veterans and it is extremely important that we live up to the commitment that we made to these disabled veterans and other senior citizens who are veterans who need to secure their health care budgets are about more than numbers budgets are about priorities and the budget that we just passed i think is an important one because i think it tells the american people what our priorities are for the future of america and i want to just outline again what those are i talked briefly for a few minutes about increasing spending for veterans health care but also we included in our budget a provision to set aside all of the social security taxes that are collected for social security which is something that is unique congress has not done that over the last 20 years the surpluses coming from social security as i know most of my colleagues know has been spent on other things we established a milestone we say from now forward all of the social security taxes 100 percent will be set aside to save social security we also want to strengthen our national defense i think it is obvious to everyone who is paying attention to the situation in kosovo the war in kosovo it is obvious that our military is strapped to the absolute limit we cannot fly many of our airplanes we are running short of armaments it is clear we have inadequate training or insufficient training in many cases that our men and women are being stretched to the limit and perhaps beyond it we need to put more resources to the national defense also as part of this budget there is a plan to lower taxes on the american people i think it is important for us to have some discussion about why it is important for us to lower taxes for the american people the portion of our national income today that is going to taxes to the burden of taxes of the federal government is the third highest it has ever been in the national history in fact the only time the percentage of our national income was higher going to taxes was in world war ii in 1945 and 1946 so it is a simple matter of fairness that the tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden on american families i think it is really important that we talk about and have a clear debate about where we think we ought to reduce taxes there are two areas i think that are particularly important one is eliminating the marriage penalty i think it is grossly unfair that 70 000 of my constituents in montana pay on average 1 400 more in taxes because they are married than if they were single i also believe that we need to do something about the estate tax there is not a tax that is more unfair than the estate tax the fact that we tax somebody simply because they die seems to me to be extraordinarily unfair while it is often perceived as a tax on the rich the very wealthy do not pay that tax it is working men and women small business owners and people who have saved and have been prudent with their money farmers and ranchers particularly are hard hit by the death tax we just passed on may 8 tax freedom day the american people have been working all year long until may 8 to support government now they get to work for their families one of the ways we can help them live up to the responsibilities of their families be able to provide for their families is by reducing taxes we did that in the last congress we passed the 400 per child tax credit it will go to 500 this year it is surprising how many montanans have written to me thanking me for that 400 per child tax credit saying that that is going to allow them to be able to spend more money on education for their children or perhaps even clothing or food or the necessities of the family or even maybe a family vacation but montanans are grateful for that incidentally that is 50 million more that will be made available to the citizens of montana to spend in montana which will of course strengthen the economy of the state of montana so many montanans write to me and say that both the husband and the wife have to work in order to support their family or a woman might even write and say that her husband has two jobs a fulltime job and a parttime job just to support the family forty percent of that income is going to the government that is too high of a percentage we ought to be 20 or 25 percent total going to government and the best way to do that is a downpayment with the marriage penalty"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as a cochairman of the congressional task force on fatherhood promotion i am very pleased to rise to speak in favor of this resolution first of all i want to thank the gentleman from indiana for his leadership in putting together this bipartisan effort to move the resolution statistics show that the american family is under siege as an institution divorce rates are very high single parenthood is becoming more and more common in communities all across the nation about onethird of all babies in this country born are born out of wedlock today for some demographic groups that rate is as high as 70 percent tonight one in four american children that go to bed will go to bed in a home in which their father does not reside times have certainly changed in 1960 more than 80 percent of americas children lived with both of their parents in a home where both parents were married in the last census that number dropped to 57 7 percent when a family breaks apart in divorce children most often live with their mother the effects of growing up without a father are becoming clear according to the 1996 gallup poll 79 1 percent of americans feel and i quote the most significant family or social problem facing america is the physical absence of the father from the home i will never forget hearing the famous psychiatrist dr armond nicoli speak about fathers and the importance of spending time with their children he had done a study of the fathers in the 128 corridor around boston and actually calculated the amount of time in minutes that a father spent with his children today and compared that with fathers in russia and he made this point he said some people say well i do not spend a lot of time with my children but the time i spend is quality time and then he said you know quality of time like the quality of air and oxygen is very important but the lack of it will kill you it is important that we spend time and spend a good amount of time with our children what role does a father play in a home well i am sure we all have our own stories and mine is not necessarily right but some of the things i used to try to do is i spent 3 days a week in the state capitol away from my children and every night i would get them on the phone and talk to each one of them on the phone i would schedule breakfast every quarter every third month with each of them individually out in a restaurant with them to listen to them to talk to them it was a wonderful time and my kids are all grown they still like to have breakfast with me i still send them each a letter every month there are lots of different kinds of things that we can do as fan ilies we can read to them every evening there are so many times and things that we can do to express our love and spend our time with our children some men perhaps make better fathers than others i suppose but clearly overall children with two parents are greatly benefitted by it thank god for our single parents and our single moms but they need help and studies show that even in a high crime or an innercity neighborhood well over 90 percent of children from safe stable two parent homes do not become delinquents children with fathers at hdme tend to do better in school they are less prone to depression and they have more successful relationships the national fatherhood initiative founded by dr wade horn and don eberly frommy district have helped to stem the tide of children being raised in homes without fathers dr horn tells us that when the national fatherhood initiative was founded the topic of fatherhood was still not considered an issue of national significance the first and the most important task that nf1 set out to accomplish was to stimulate a broadbased societywide social movement on behalf of involved committed responsible fatherhood the national fatherhood initiative is doing a very effective job i think and celebrities like tom selleck james earl jones tiger woods and his father earl general colin powell coach joe paterno have all lent their names and efforts to this cause i along with several other members in congress have come together to form this task force on fatherhood promotion trying to raise the profile of the issue by legislative have means and the nfi has been very successful thousands of communitybased grassroots programs designed to provide support skills encouragement to fathers have sprung up all over the country dozens of governors have held fatherhood conferences fatherlessness isgetting theattention that it finally deserves according to the 1996 gallup poll 90 9 percent of parents believe it is important for children to live in a home with both father and mother this resolution recognizes that the creation of a better country depends in large part on the active involvement of both parents fathers in helping rearing and developing their children this resolution urges each father in america to accept his full share of responsibility for the lives of his children to be actively involved in rearing his children to encourage the academic moral spiritual development of his children this resolution urges governments and institutions at every level to remove barriers to father involvement to enact public policies that are father friendly that encourage and support the efforts of fathers who want to become more engaged in the lives of their children it encourages each father to devote time energy and resources to his children recognizing that children need not only material support but also more importantly a secure and nurturing family environment finally this resolution expresses our support for the national fatherhood initiative its work to inspire and equip fathers to be positively involved in raising and developing their children the family is the core of american society as goes the american family so goes

speak on this but i think we lose touch with reality here now the reality is that the responsibility for educating these children is really not the federal governments it is the local school districts responsibility the reason that the federal government got into it at all was because there was a court case brought that proved that the local people were not educating those children with disabilities because it was so much more expensive to do so now i understand that so when the federal government got into it they made a commitment that they would fund 40 percent of that extra cost of educating these children with disabilities i do not like to call it disabilities i think it is more challenges to them it is disabilities in our mind but the fact is that when we did we made that commitment and like a lot of people here i have felt badly that we have never lived up to that commitment but we never lived up to the commitment of full funding head start or full funding a lot of other programs that are doing equally responsible jobs but remember this that the responsibility for educating children lies at the local level our colleagues on the other side constantly remind us of that that that responsibility lies there so the decisions should be made there so how about the decisions to funding the cost of educating these children they did not want to make that decision so we made it for them we said that they will educate those children then i think magnanimously we offered to fund 40 percent of it now all of a sudden that becomes a burden to us not that i disagree with the fact that we ought to live up to that commitment because we made it because we do not want to be people who go back on promises as elected officials and leaders of the communities so i agree with
