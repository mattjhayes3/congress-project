the budget crisis his director of omb leon panetta stated that republicans would have killed to be able to offer this budget and we have been exposed to democrat after democrat crowing about the

billion in 1997 256 billion in 2001 and 365 billion in 2004 in washington this is considered success obviously something stronger is needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the

will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second

detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work

shown tonight in this debate all the canadian system can claim is that everyone has access to the system but you have to stop and ask yourself what is the quality of the system how long will i have to wait to getthe test or procedure i need how much more will i pay in taxes they promise that theyll be able to expand access to everyone and no one will have to pay more but remember what your mother

say well have lower costs next year and then forbid hospitals from getting the latest and best equipment but is that how we want costs lowered fortunately there are other options out there if we want to control costs we should target the key cost drivers we should reform our malpractice system to eliminate the unnecessary procedures that are done simply to protect the provider if theyre dragged into court we should adopt a single insuranceform and electronic billing so that administrative costs are lowered we should tighten our fraud laws to eliminate this cost in our system we should reform our antitrust laws so that communities have the opportunity to coordinate the delivery of health care no longer will each hospital have to buy the latest and often most expensive diagnostic tool and if we want someone to control costs it should be the consumer in consultation with his her physician who decides if a treatment is appropriate or not we should allow the creation of medical savings accounts or medisave accounts that are integrated with a catastrophic plan let me explain how this would work on average employers nationwide pay 4 500 per year to buy health coverage for an employee family under our legislation employers would be encouraged to take 1 500 of that 4 500 and purchase a major medical insurance policy that would give employers everything they have now except the insurance policy would have a 3 000 deductible in other words the employee would pay the first 3 000 of health care costs the company would cover that possible 3 000 expense to employees by setting up a medical savings account in the employees name and depositing 3 000 in it each year whenever an employee needed medical service he would go get it wherever he chose and then would present a debit card and the bill would be paid from the 3 000 in his medical savings account anything he didnt spend at years end he would get to keep all of a sudden people have an incentive to make a choice between 200 at the emergency room or 50 at the doctors office because they are spending their own medical savings account money if a family had multiple illnesses the 3 000 would be spent from the account and then the major medical policy would kick in the employee is as well off as he is under the high premium low or no deductible plan he has today but if the employee be exercising prudence can save some of the 3 000 year after year that account can grow as a taxfree ira that money could then be used later in life to purchase longterm care or for other medical services the debate on

pregnant women in the following manner because of the potential risk to the fetus women requesting therapeutic abortion were employed as subjects these volunteers received the vaccine and underwent the abortion 11 to 30 days later examination of tissues from the dead aborted fetuses showed that in contrast to the results in monkeys the vaccine virus did cross the human placenta and infect the

as guinea pigs and then killed by the abortionist and then their bodies were dissected to see what happefied what happens if some of those women decided not to abort and these children were affected

dc politicians is outrage because they say the people of the district would never support becoming a city in maryland however after i introduced retrocession legislation i received several hundred

needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the balanced budget amendment first they fear a balanced budget amendment will tie the hands of congress and force it to cut some programs in order to fund others in other words they fear that congress will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second there are those groups who question the effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work or not the answer is the balanced budget amendment will establish the framework under which congress will have to make its spending decisions congress will still have to make the spending decisions but it will be done without the openended funding option now available this is the third time in the last 4 years the house will vote

ask yourself what is the quality of the system how long will i have to wait to getthe test or procedure i need how much more will i pay in taxes they promise that theyll be able to expand access to everyone and no one will have to pay more but remember what your mother told you if it sounds too good to be true it is they cite government estimates and reports produced by the cbo and gao but remember the government has never correctly estimated the cost of its programs thats why congress keeps going back to hardworking americans to ask them to pay more in taxes this case is no different their sole cost containment mechanism is simply to have the government say well have lower costs next year and then forbid hospitals from getting the latest and best equipment but is that how we want costs lowered fortunately there are other options out there if we want to control costs we should target the key cost drivers we should reform our malpractice system to eliminate the unnecessary procedures that are done simply to protect the provider if theyre dragged into court we should adopt a single insuranceform and electronic billing so that administrative costs are lowered we should tighten our fraud laws to eliminate this cost in our system we should reform our antitrust laws so that communities have the opportunity to coordinate the delivery of health care no longer will each hospital have to buy the latest and often most expensive diagnostic tool and if we want someone to control costs it should be the consumer in consultation with his her physician who decides if a treatment is appropriate or not we should allow the creation of medical savings accounts or medisave accounts that are integrated with a catastrophic plan let me explain how this would work on average employers nationwide pay 4 500 per year to buy health coverage for an employee family under our legislation employers would be encouraged to take 1 500 of that 4 500 and purchase a major medical insurance policy that would give employers everything they have now except the insurance policy would have a 3 000 deductible in other words the employee would pay the first 3 000 of health care costs the company would cover that possible 3 000 expense to employees by setting up a medical savings account in the employees name and depositing 3 000 in it each year whenever an employee needed medical service he would go get it wherever he chose and then would present a debit card and the bill would be paid from the 3 000 in his medical savings account anything he didnt spend at years end he would get to keep all of a sudden people have an incentive to make a choice between 200 at the emergency room or 50 at the doctors office because they are spending their own medical savings account money if a family had multiple illnesses the 3 000 would be spent from the account and then the major medical policy would kick in the employee is as well off as he is under the high premium low or no deductible plan he has today but if the employee be exercising prudence can save some of the 3 000 year after year that account can grow as a taxfree ira that money could then be used later in life to purchase longterm care or for other medical services the debate on health care reform has just begun whatever reforms we adopt we should make sure that it controls spiraling costs and makes health
