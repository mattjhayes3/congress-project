care institution in montana the one that was there was forced to close down a year ago i sat down with hcfa the clinton administration and that hmo to try to keep it alive a year ago and one of the things that i discovered is that when the clinton administration forced the closure of that hmo it knew that it was going to cost more to provide health care to those seniors under the feeforservice medicare than it would under the hmo and this was a providerbased hmo i thought to myself why in the world would they do that would they force people into poor coverage no prescription drug coverage and higher deductibles when they knew it was going to cost more then it dawned on me the clinton administration wants to destroy managed care medicare choice what we have here is democrats coming to this floor pretending that they want to keep those seniors who have that program covered when the reality is they want to destroy that program because they do not want seniors to have a choice but they want to blame repiublicans for doing it and it is wrong and they are wrong for doing it we did the right thing by voting that resolution down"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "2 months ago the diabetes research working group released its report entitled conquering diabetes a strategic plan for the 21st century this document was a result of over a year of effort on the part of 12 scientific experts and four representatives from the lay diabetes community support was provided by dozens of other individuals both from within the national institutes of health and from outside the nih the working group was established by congress as part of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations act and based on legislation i introduced in the last session of congress it requested that nih establish the group to develop a comprehensive plan for nihfunded diabetes research dr ronald kahn is an outstanding physician and scientist he was selected the chairman of the group he has spent literally thousands of hours meeting and talking with countless individuals to establish a consensus on the direction of diabetes research the report has exceeded all expectations it clearly details the magnitude of the disease both on the individual and on our society on an individual level diabetes affects virtually every tissue of the body with severe damage since 1980 the ageadjusted death rate due to diabetes has increased by 30 percent while the death rate has fallen for other common diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke diabetes affects about 16 million americans with 800 000 new cases diagnosed each year the societal impact is likewise staggering one in four medicare dollars are spent to treat people with diabetes and over one in 10 health care dollars spent are spent for diabetes in economic terms the cost to society is over 105 billion each year the report identifies five areas of extraordinary research opportunities for making progress in understanding and treating and ultimately preventing and curing diabetes these five areas are the genetics of diabetes and its complications autoimmunity and the beta cell cell signaling and cell regulation obesity and clinical trials and research within each area specific research recommendations are made and in all areas rapid advancements are anticipated finally conquering diabetes the name of this report presents an analysis of current spending and estimates programbyprogram of the cost of implementing each opportunity current spending the group reports is far short of what is required to make progress on this complex and difficult problem they calculate that an increase of 384 million in fiscal year 2000 rising to 1 166 billion in fiscal year 2004 is quote required to have a robust and effective diabetes research effort one which will reduce the rising burden created by this debilitating disease the release of the report has generated extraordinary interest among the scientific community some argue that advances in research must be present to generate an increased nih portfolio while others argue that the presence of research dollars will generate advances as in the case of aids by either standard the time to establish a national commitment to diabetes research is now congress must seize upon the momentum in diabetes research and fully enact the diabetes research working group report recommendations it will take a commitment of 827 million in the next fiscal year the scientific community has united to develop a concrete plan and now it is up to the congress to unite to make this plan a reality i must conclude by saying that this is a very important initiative for our country i know it is going to be a difficult year economically for the appropriations subcommittee that has to deal with this issue but i must say it is in the nations best interest it is in the interest of scientific research and the diabetic and all the complications that come from diabetes that the congress step up and say 827 million is the number i urge my colleagues to support this initiative in the house"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "3 weeks ago i first learned the story of a lieutenant colonel working for the department of

peltier is currently in the penitentiary federal penitentiary for the assassination of two fbi agents he has been in prison for 25 years i need to be fair to all of my colleagues here and give you some disclosures first of all i used to be a police officer as a result of being a police officer over the years and especially during the time of my tenure as a police officer i developed a very close relationship with agents of the federal bu reau of investigation over the years i have also developed a great deal of respect for the federal bureau of investigation but i must also tell my colleagues that over these years i have also had an opportunity to carefully scrutinize the federal bureau of investigation because you see i think it is a very important agency for our country but i think the integrity of the agency is also very very important in the past i have been very critical of the federal bureau of investigation when they messed up i can give you an excellent example ruby ridge the agents involved at ruby ridge in my opinion should have been immediately terminated what happened at ruby ridge i will not repeat this evening but i will tell you that the command officer from the federal bureau of investigation was not terminated in fact the command officer was put on a paid leave of absence for 1 or 2 years and retired and received in my opinion no punishment at all i am also looking with a very careful eye at the federal bureau of investigations role at the waco texas goofup that too is a very tragic situation in the history of our country and i think unfortunately there will be revealed within the report about the incident at waco texas that the federal bureau of investigation misstated their role understated their contribution so to speak or their involveient in the situation at waco texas so i am not necessarily in lockstep with the federal bureau of investigation but i can tell you when i look at all of the law enforcement agencies i have seen over the years and as a former law enforcement officer i have had the opportunity to be involved with many of them at the very highest when you look at the picture as an average the federal bureau of investigation comes out at the very top and i think it isi incumbent colleagues of every one of us when we see an attack launched against the federal bureau of investigation that is launched without justification or when we see an action being taken against the federal bureau of investigation without justification we have a commitment to step forward and say something about it as i mentioned at the beginning of my comments i saw an article the other day about this individual this gentlemans name is leonard peltier i saw today in fact an article in the usa today the article is indians fbi face off in washington first of all i am not sure why the author of the usa today article uses the word indians in a broad or general descriptive form in imy particular district which is the third congressional district of the state of colorado we have the indian tribal lands and i have yet to hear from any of the leaders of those indian tribes of which i work with very closely on projects such as the animus laplata the kind of appeal that may be suggested by all indians as a result of this particular article it is my opinion that the native american involvement in this case is limited and it is also my opinionthat if you sit down with the average native american in this country and you look at the facts of this case that there will be very few native americans who would step forward and say that this particular convict is a political prisoner i think this is a stage being set by the defense attorneys for this convict actually using the word convict is somewhat gentle he is not a convict he is a murderer and he is a coldblooded murderer he killed two fbi agents in cold blood now 25 years ago as one defense attorney would suggest is something that enough time has passed by that perhaps he has served his time for this violent and horrible crime i will quote exactly from the usa today peltier that is the convict the murderer that i am talking about has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in attorney carl nadler says can you believe this let me repeat what this defense attorney says peltier has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in prison what he is suggesting is that 25 years is enough time for somebody to serve that goes out and in cold blood assassinates two officers of the federal bureau of investigation well r stand here tonight colleagues in deep disagreement with this defense attorney and i urge that all of my colleagues on the floor take time to review what is going on in the month of november in regard to this case now why have i suggested the month of november well apparently this murderers defense team has put together a little political show and tell and they call november the month of publicity or the month to get reprieve for this convicted murderer what i mean by that it is this month that they are submitting papers to the president of the united states request ing that clemency be granted to leonard peltier a convicted murderer a couple of days ago i read an open letter this open letter is a joint letter authored by the federal bureau of investigation agents association located in new rochelle new york and the society of former special agents of the federal bureau of investigation located in quantico virginia the above organizations which are professional nongovernmental associations rep resent over 20 000 active duty and former fbi agents i was so moved by this letter that i ask my colleagues to follow me closely this evening as i read verbatim that open letter to the american people as many of you know i do not often read from notes when i speak from this podium but i am going to be very careful this evening that i read this letter verbatim because i think it is important that every one of us in this room have a clear understahding of the facts of this case before peltiers defense attorney arrives here in washington d c sets up this political show and tell and tries to convince through propaganda that for some reason this convicted murderer deserves clemency from the president of the united states we should not take this lightly we had a very difficult situation about 1 month ago when clemency was given to the puerto rican terrorists as i pointed out from this house floor you can look right up in the roof of this fine room and you can see the bullet hole or i could walk over here to this desk drawer and show you the bullet holes through that desk from the puerto rican terrorists who entered this floor many years ago firing weapons well this case is somewhat similar except in this case we know we have the person who conducted two savage cold blooded murders on these fbi agents let me begin the letter june 26 1975 was a hot dusty thursday on the pine ridge indian reservation in southwestern south dakota when two fbi agents arrived from their office in rapid city it was about noon when special agents ronald a williams age 27 and jack r coler age 28 pulled into the jumping bull compound area of the remote reservation seeking to arrest a young man in connection with the recent abduction and assault of two young ranchers observing their suspect peltiers vehicle the agents pursied it unknown to special agent coler and special agent williams one of the three men in the vehicle was leonard peltier a violent man with a violent past he was a fugitive wanted for attempted murder of an off duty milwaukee police officer knowing that the two vehicles pursuing him were occupied by fbi agents and believing they were seeking t arresthim on that attempted murder case peltier and his associates abruptly stopped their vehicle and began firing rifles at the agents surprised by the sudden violence outmanned outgunned and at an extreme tactical disadvantage coler and williams were both wounded and defenseless within minutes coler sustained a severe wound the force of the bullet nearly tearing his right arm off williams wounded in the left shoulder and the right foot removed his shirt during the hail of incoming rifle fire and fashioned a tourniquet around the arm ofcoler who had by then fallen unconscious agents coler and williams were then at the mercy of leonard peltier and his associates but there was to be no mercy for these fine young law enforcement officers not satisfied with the terrible injuries that they had inflicted peltier and the two other men walked down the hill towards the ambushed agents three shots were fired from peltiers rifle williams kneeling and apparently surrendering was shot in the face directly through his out extended shielding handled he died instantly coler who was still unconscious was shot twice in the head at closerange he died instantly from those shots the crime scene examination testified to the brutality of the ambush coler and williams had little chance to defend themselves they had fired only five shots in contrast over 125 bullet holes were found in into the car following the murder peltier fled the reservation in november 1975 an oregon state trooper stopped a recreational vehicle in which peltier was hiding peltier fired at the trooper and escaped coler the fbi agent who had been assassinated earlier on his revolver which was stolen when he was murdered was found in a paper bag under the front seat of the recreational vehicle peltiers thumb print was on that bag when arrested later in canada by the royal canadian mounted police peltier remarked that had he known the royal canadian mounted police officers were there to arrest him he would have blown them out of their shoes these are not the comments of an innocent man and they pottray the true character and the violent nature of leonard peltier in april 1977 a jury convicted peltier of themurders of those two fbi agents coler and williams a judge sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences while incarcerated in the lompoc california federal prison and with outside assistance peltier shot his way out of jail using a smuggled rifle to make his escape several days later after assaulting a rancher and stealing a pick up peltier was captured he was tried and convicted of escape and ofbeing a felon in possession of a firearm peltier has since appealed his various convictions numerous times each time the federal courts have upheld earlier legal decisions the united states supreme court has twice denied peltier review without comment the record is clear there were no new facts there are no new facts the old facts have not changed and peltier is guilty as charged i several times on national television peltier has admitted to firing at the two agents in his most recent public interview peltier has even reluctantly conceded what he had previously denied that he had in fact gone down to where the agents were executed still he openly states that he feels no guilt no remorse nor even any regret for the murders leonard peltier has lived a life of crime he has earned and deserves a lifetime of incarceration leonard peltier is a murderer without compassion or feeling towards his fellow man in turn he deserves no compassion mr president there is no justification for relieving leonard peltier from his punishment our judicial system has spoken in this case again again and again leonard peltier is a vicioug violent and cowardly criminal that hides behind legitimate native american issues leonard peltier was never a leader in the native american community he is simply a brute thug and murderer with no respect no regard for human life our citizens on and off the reservations must be protected from predators like peltier mr president since leonard peltier could not fool the federal courts he is now trying to fool you to fool the public he is shading and hiding the facts and playing on sympathy he and his advocates want to confuse the fact of his guilt with matters completely extraneous to that fact do not let him get away with it mr president sympathy is appropriate only for dead heroes and surviving families do not let their sacrifice be forgotten that was somewhat of a lengthy letter but as you can tell it is a subject that should be dear to every one of our hearts in this room to the heart of every american out there that believes in law and justice to every law enforcement family out there that currently has someone in law enfordement or has had a member of their family in law enforcement if we let if we let this kind of violent assassin out of prison after serving only 24 years it will in my opinion be a crippling blow to the message that we need to send to the law enforcement in this country that message really is fairly simple that is that you work as a law enforcement officer to provide as your duty peace and justice in our system and that when eace and justice are attacked in our system our system has a price it has a consequence it has a punishment it is the only way we can uphold the integrity of our system of law enforcement is to have a zero tolerance or a limited tolerance of any type of direct attack against our system of peace and justice the assassination of two federal bureau of investigation agents no matter how many years ago is a direct attack against the legal and justice process in this country i urge all my colleagues to join with me in attempting to be persuasive with the president of the united states and the american public in saying how important it is that this politicalcharade being put on by the defense attorneys for this convicted assassin that this kind of show be stopped that this kind of show be denied their goal their goal of course is to let this convicted assassin walk the streets of america again do not let him hide under the shield of being a native american that is a disgrace to the native americans do not pull native americans down to the level of this convicted killer do not affiliate this convicted killer with the native americans in this country that is an insult in my opinion if we do do not forget the facts of the case just so that i can remind the members let me go through the facts again in a little briefer form than the letter two fbi agents were assassinated they attempted to pursue a vehicle which contained this suspect at the time suspect now a convicted killer leonard peltier they were wounded they were disarmed by the wounds that they had in othef words they could not fight back they didnt have any weapons left to fight back with they were not physically capable one the fbi agents was unconscious the other fbi agent was rendering first aid to the unconscious fbi agent this convicted killer who by the way was a fugitive from justice for the attempted assassination of an offduty police officer in milwaukee walked up to these two fbi agents and executed them in cold blood he was later stopped in a recreational vehicle in that vehicle they found one of the deceased agents pistols in a paper bag that bag had evidence peltiers fingerprints on it peltier was captured in canada he was convicted of two counts of murder for these fbi agents he escaped from the federal prison do not let people tell us this guy is a nonviolent guy he was in federal prison and he shot his way out of federal prison think of the last time since the john dillinger days or bonnie and clyde and so on that somebody shot their way out of the federal prison that is who this individual is now today now today he is in front of the american people in front of the president of the united states asking for mercy look 25 years ago may seem like a long time to some but it has been a real long time for the families of those young fbi agents that were assassinated in cold blood in conclusion on this particular issue let me ask for members support in standing up strong for the law enforcement community of the country in standing up strong for the families and the agents and professionals of the federal bureau of investigation in standing up strong for the concept of peace and justice within the boundaries of our country let us all have our voice heard that in the united states of america if you assassinate a police officer or just as soon two federal bureau of investigation officers you will pay a price and we will stick with the punishment that we deal out we are not a bunch of patsies do not come back to us and think you are going to get a free walk 25 years later after that kind of action if we fail to do this if we fail to do this we are sending the wrong message out there and we are crippling justice and peace in our country i would like to do an update on a couple of other subjects this evening while i have the opportunity to visit with the members as members will recall about 2 or 3 weeks ago maybe a month ago there is a museum in new york city called the brooklyn art museum the brooklyn art museum it was discovered with taxpayer dollars with taxpayer dollars was sponsoring an art exhibit that depicted among other things a portrait of the virgin mary which is one of the holiest symbols of the catholic religion throughout the world and of christianity throughout the world this art museum was allowingin this art exhibit with taxpayer dollars this portrait of the virgin mary with elephant dung as they say crap as i say thrown all over the portrait can members imagine that how long do members think that type of art exhibit would have been tolerated or should have been tolerated in this country at taxpayer dollars if it was an exhibit of martin luther king for example or if it were an exhibit of an outstanding jewish rabbi for example or if it were an exhibit of some other outstanding leader that meant so much to a religious organization anywhere in this world they would not put up with that but for some reason there seems to be some justification out there by some people that an attack on christianity should be separated from an attack say on martin luther king or an attack on the image of a jewish rabbi and so on and so forth what happened is that the mayor of new york city mayor rudy giuliani i think had some guts he stood up and he said we are drawing the line that has gone too far there is a strong freedom of expression in this country there is a first amendment in this country but there is a balance that we have in this country just the same as under the freedom of speech we do not allow individuals to go into a theater and yell fire fire fire we do not allow that that is not a violation of your first amendment rights but we do not allow you to go into a theater and do that we draw a line this thing is not carte blanche this first amendment to do anything that you feel like doing especially when you do it with taxpayer dollars the mayor came under heavy criticism by the very elite that were dealing with the brooklyn art museum the board of directors who i think were acting very pompous in somehow defending this disgraceful work of art not a work of art that is just controversial that brings up lots of discussion but a work of art that hit at the very integrity of a large religious group throughout the world that was the maximum type of insult that you could throw at that particular religion and did it with ainerican taxpayer dollars why do i keep bringing up the fact of american taxpayer dollars because therein lies the distinction as to whether or not this is an issue under the first amendment of our constitution under our constitution frankly had the united states taxpayer dollars not been used to fund this portrait of the virgin mary of which dung was thrown all over it had taxpayer dollars not been used i am afraid to say that this would have been probably protected or would have been protected underthe first amendment we can tolerate that it is horrible and i cannot imagine for example why the first lady hillary clinton stood up for this thing she said however in her comments that while she would not go see it but she certainly stood up for the right to go around and exhibit this with taxpayer dollars iunderstand where some would say it is a first amendment right if there is not taxpayer dollars being used although i can tell the members that the press in this country and the liberal left in this country would not have stood for 2 seconds if it were martin luther king or a jewish rabbi or some other celebrated figure being treated in that fashion but the key here is taxpayer dollars 0 2320 the point here is very clear and i think the citizens of this country i think we need to go out and ask our constituents do the citizens of this country really think it is a justified and constitutionally protected right under the constitution to fund this kind of art with taxpayer dollars or should this type of art be denied the access of taxpayer dollars and allowed to be funded in society with private dollars remember that my objection tonight and the mayor of new york citys objection to this art was not that the art should iot be shown now it is disgraceful do not get me wrong i do not condone this kind of art but there is a constitutionally protected right to show this art without taxpayer dollars that argument has some legitimacy but that was not the debate that is being carried forward here what the mayor said what i said and mr speaker what i think most of our constituents believe is that this kind of art i e the virgin mary with dung splashed all over her with taxpayer dollars has gone over that line you draw a line you have gone over that line do not use taxpayer dollars the brooklyn art museum in new york they could easily fund this through other monies they just want to try and make an issue what they want to do is open that door so that taxpayers in this country will have to pay out of their hardearned dollars will have to use those taxpayer dollars to let the socalled art community especially the elite of the brooklyn art museum fund anything they would like no matter how offensive no matter how derogatory it is that is wrong this art museum knows that it is wrong well there has been a new step a new report to update you on and that is that a federal court judge this week actually came out and said that the art museum has a right to use taxpayer dollars to exhibit this type of art i e the virgin mary with dung thrown all over her in very obviously a disgraceful fashion intended to be as derogatory as possible not only towards christianity but towards one of the most important symbols of christianity i am telling you federal judge you made a mistake you are wrong there is not a constitutionally protected provision that says you can use taxpayer dollars in this country to fund that kind of art why do you not use some common sense why do you have to offend the people of christianity why do you do an allout attack you would not do it with martin luther king and the black community you would not do it in the jewish community with some rabbi of theirs you would not do it with some other type of religious entity or important entity in this country with their leader why are you doing this why do you decide to use taxpayer dollars to offend every christian in the world it is wrong you have got a temporary victory from this federal judge but in the end i think the mayor of new york city one had a lot of guts to do what he did and number two i think he is going to prevail i also think that the general opinion in this country is look that kind of art as violent and as horrible and as disgraceful as it is is protected but not with the use of taxpayer dollars our constituents i do not believe are in any way about to buy the argument that we ought to take the tax dollars out of their paycheck every week and put a percentage of that towards the funding of this kind of art"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "a dear colleague letter will be delivered to each members

florida in the city of tampa at the turn of the century the world was a far different place for bill mote back in the early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers

people who knew bill to understand how his passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries ecology and enhancement at florida state university he also encouraged younger people to become interested in marine life schoolchildren were exposed to the smallest creatures as well as the magnificent sharks and dolphins at mote marine laboratories aquarium a new state of the art marine mammal rescue center gives all visitors a firsthand look at the expert veterinary care that motes marine biologists provide bill will always be remembered as a promoter of education as well as an excellent educator himself he was at the helm when the jason

the titanic the bismarck and other landmark discoveries beneath the depths of our oceans mr mote was constantly expanding the depths of our understanding even to the bottom of the sea even larger than his love of the oceans was his love for education he gave not only to the studies of marine biology and oceanography but also relentlessly promoted the fields to youth and professionals alike with his own special blend of enthusiasm in 1968 mr mote was awarded the gold medal of the international oceanographic foundation many of us who knew bill mote have our own stories to tell after meeting a

psychiatric care saying that somebody has to try to commit suicide three times before one can qualify that may sound absurd but let us just say that the plan does that a little boy goes out a teenager tries to commit suicide once tries to commit suicide twice and finally on the third time commits suicide now under the boehner bill that plan followed its own criteria guess what under the boehner

this document was a result of over a year of effort on the part of 12 scientific experts and four representatives from the lay diabetes community support was provided by dozens of other individuals both from within the national institutes of health and from outside the nih the working group was established by congress as part of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations act and based on legislation i introduced in the last session of congress it requested that nih establish the group to develop a comprehensive plan for nihfunded diabetes research dr ronald kahn is an outstanding physician and scientist he was selected the chairman of the group he has spent literally thousands of hours meeting and talking with countless individuals to establish a consensus on the direction of diabetes research the report has exceeded all expectations it clearly details the magnitude of the disease both on the individual and on our society on an individual level diabetes affects virtually every tissue of the body with severe damage since 1980 the ageadjusted death rate due to diabetes has increased by 30 percent while the death rate has fallen for other common diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke diabetes affects about 16 million americans with 800 000 new cases diagnosed each year the societal impact is likewise staggering one in four medicare dollars are spent to treat people with diabetes and over one in 10 health care dollars spent are spent for diabetes in economic terms the cost to society is over 105 billion each year the report identifies five areas of extraordinary research opportunities for making progress in understanding and treating and ultimately preventing and curing diabetes these five areas are the genetics of diabetes and its complications autoimmunity and the beta cell cell signaling and cell regulation obesity and clinical trials and research within each area specific research recommendations are made and in all areas rapid advancements are anticipated finally conquering diabetes the name of this report presents an analysis of current spending and estimates programbyprogram of the cost of implementing each opportunity current spending the group reports is far short of what is required to make progress on this complex and difficult problem they calculate that an increase of 384 million in fiscal year 2000 rising to 1 166 billion in fiscal year 2004 is quote required to have a robust and effective diabetes research effort one which will reduce the rising burden created by this debilitating disease the release of the report has generated extraordinary interest among the scientific community some argue that advances in research must be present to generate an increased nih portfolio while others argue that the presence of research dollars will generate advances as in the case of aids by either standard the time to establish a national commitment to diabetes research is now congress must seize upon the

article that i read about an individual by the name of leonard peltier mr peltier is currently in the penitentiary federal penitentiary for the assassination of two fbi agents he has been in prison for 25 years i need to be fair to all of my colleagues here and give you some disclosures first of all i used to be a police officer as a result of being a police officer over the years and especially during the time of my tenure as a police officer i developed a very close relationship with agents of the federal bu reau of investigation over the years i have also developed a great deal of respect for the federal bureau of investigation but i must also tell my colleagues that over these years i have also had an opportunity to carefully scrutinize the federal bureau of investigation because you see i think it is a very important agency for our country but i think the integrity of the agency is also very very important in the past i have been very critical of the federal bureau of investigation when they messed up i can give you an excellent example ruby ridge the agents involved at ruby ridge in my opinion should have been immediately terminated what happened at ruby ridge i will not repeat this evening but i will tell you that the command officer from the federal bureau of investigation was not terminated in fact the command officer was put on a paid leave of absence for 1 or 2 years and retired and received in my opinion no punishment at all i am also looking with a very careful eye at the federal bureau of investigations role at the waco texas goofup that too is a very tragic situation in the history of our country and i think unfortunately there will be revealed within the report about the incident at waco texas that the federal bureau of investigation misstated their role understated their contribution so to speak or their involveient in the situation at waco texas so i am not necessarily in lockstep with the federal bureau of investigation but i can tell you when i look at all of the law enforcement agencies i have seen over the years and as a former law enforcement officer i have had the opportunity to be involved with many of them at the very highest when you look at the picture as an average the federal bureau of investigation comes out at the very top and i think it isi incumbent colleagues of every one of us when we see an attack launched against the federal bureau of investigation that is launched without justification or when we see an action being taken against the federal bureau of investigation without justification we have a commitment to step forward and say something about it as i mentioned at the beginning of my comments i saw an article the other day about this individual this gentlemans name is leonard peltier i saw today in fact an article in the usa today the article is indians fbi face off in washington first of all i am not sure why the author of the usa today article uses the word indians in a broad or general descriptive form in imy particular district which is the third congressional district of the state of colorado we have the indian tribal lands and i have yet to hear from any of the leaders of those indian tribes of which i work with very closely on projects such as the animus laplata the kind of appeal that may be suggested by all indians as a result of this particular article it is my opinion that the native american involvement in this case is limited and it is also my opinionthat if you sit down with the average native american in this country and you look at the facts of this case that there will be very few native americans who would step forward and say that this particular convict is a political prisoner i think this is a stage being set by the defense attorneys for this convict actually using the word convict is somewhat gentle he is not a convict he is a murderer and he is a coldblooded murderer he killed two fbi agents in cold blood now 25 years ago as one defense attorney would suggest is something that enough time has passed by that perhaps he has served his time for this violent and horrible crime i will quote exactly from the usa today peltier that is the convict the murderer that i am talking about has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in attorney carl nadler says can you believe this let me repeat what this defense attorney says peltier has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in prison what he is suggesting is that 25 years is enough time for somebody to serve that goes out and in cold blood assassinates two officers of the federal bureau of investigation well r stand here tonight colleagues in deep disagreement with this defense attorney and i urge that all of my colleagues on the floor take time to review what is going on in the month of november in regard to this case now why have i suggested the month of november well apparently this murderers defense team has put together a little political show and tell and they call november the month of publicity or the month to get reprieve for this convicted murderer what i mean by that it is this month that they are submitting papers to the president of the united states request ing that clemency be granted to leonard peltier a convicted murderer a couple of days ago i read an open letter this open letter is a joint letter authored by the federal bureau of investigation agents association located in new rochelle new york and the society of former special agents of the federal bureau of investigation located in quantico virginia the above organizations which are professional nongovernmental associations rep resent over 20 000 active duty and former fbi agents i was so moved by this letter that i ask my colleagues to follow me closely this evening as i read verbatim that open letter to the american people as many of you know i do not often read from notes when i speak from this podium but i am going to be very careful this evening that i read this letter verbatim because i think it is important that every one of us in this room have a clear understahding of the facts of this case before peltiers defense attorney arrives here in washington d c sets up this political show and tell and tries to convince through propaganda that for some reason this convicted murderer deserves clemency from the president of the united states we should not take this lightly we had a very difficult situation about 1 month ago when clemency was given to the puerto rican terrorists as i pointed out from this house floor you can look right up in the roof of this fine room and you can see the bullet hole or i could walk over here to this desk drawer and show you the bullet holes through that desk from the puerto rican terrorists who entered this floor many years ago firing weapons well this case is somewhat similar except in this case we know we have the person who conducted two savage cold blooded murders on these fbi agents let me begin the letter june 26 1975 was a hot dusty thursday on the pine ridge indian reservation in southwestern south dakota when two fbi agents arrived from their office in rapid city it was about noon when special agents ronald a williams age 27 and jack r coler age 28 pulled into the jumping bull compound area of the remote reservation seeking to arrest a young man in connection with the recent abduction and assault of two young ranchers observing their suspect peltiers vehicle the agents pursied it unknown to special agent coler and special agent williams one of the three men in the vehicle was leonard peltier a violent man with a violent past he was a fugitive wanted for attempted murder of an off duty milwaukee police officer knowing that the two vehicles pursuing him were occupied by fbi agents and believing they were seeking t arresthim on that attempted murder case peltier and his associates abruptly stopped their vehicle and began firing rifles at the agents surprised by the sudden violence outmanned outgunned and at an extreme tactical disadvantage coler and williams were both wounded and defenseless within minutes coler sustained a severe wound the force of the bullet nearly tearing his right arm off williams wounded in the left shoulder and the right foot removed his shirt during the hail of incoming rifle fire and fashioned a tourniquet around the arm ofcoler who had by then fallen unconscious agents coler and williams were then at the mercy of leonard peltier and his associates but there was to be no mercy for these fine young law enforcement officers not satisfied with the terrible injuries that they had inflicted peltier and the two other men walked down the hill towards the ambushed agents three shots were fired from peltiers rifle williams kneeling and apparently surrendering was shot in the face directly through his out extended shielding handled he died instantly coler who was still unconscious was shot twice in the head at closerange he died instantly from those shots the crime scene examination testified to the brutality of the ambush coler and williams had little chance to defend themselves they had fired only five shots in contrast over 125 bullet holes were found in into the car following the murder peltier fled the reservation in november 1975 an oregon state trooper stopped a recreational vehicle in which peltier was hiding peltier fired at the trooper and escaped coler the fbi agent who had been assassinated earlier on his revolver which was stolen when he was murdered was found in a paper bag under the front seat of the recreational vehicle peltiers thumb print was on that bag when arrested later in canada by the royal canadian mounted police peltier remarked that had he known the royal canadian mounted police officers were there to arrest him he would have blown them out of their shoes these are not the comments of an innocent man and they pottray the true character and the violent nature of leonard peltier in april 1977 a jury convicted peltier of themurders of those two fbi agents coler and williams a judge sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences while incarcerated in the lompoc california federal prison and with outside assistance peltier shot his way out of jail using a smuggled rifle to make his escape several days later after assaulting a rancher and stealing a pick up peltier was captured he was tried and convicted of escape and ofbeing a felon in possession of a firearm peltier has since appealed his various convictions numerous times each time the federal courts have upheld earlier legal decisions the united states supreme court has twice denied peltier review without comment the record is clear there were no new facts there are no new facts the old facts have not changed and peltier is guilty as charged i several times on national television peltier has admitted to firing at the two agents in his most recent public interview peltier has even reluctantly conceded what he had previously denied that he had in fact gone down to where the agents were executed still he openly states that he feels no guilt no remorse nor even any regret for the murders leonard peltier has lived a life of crime he has earned and deserves a lifetime of incarceration leonard peltier is a murderer without compassion or feeling towards his fellow man in turn he deserves no compassion mr president there is no justification for relieving leonard peltier from his punishment our judicial system has spoken in this case again again and again leonard peltier is a vicioug violent and cowardly criminal that hides behind legitimate native american issues leonard peltier was never a leader in the native american community he is simply a brute thug and murderer with no respect no regard for human life our citizens on and off the reservations must be protected from predators like peltier mr president since leonard peltier could not fool the federal courts he is now trying to fool you to fool the public he is shading and hiding the facts and playing on sympathy he and his advocates want to confuse the fact of his guilt with matters completely extraneous to that fact do not let him get away with it mr president sympathy is appropriate only for dead heroes and surviving families do not let their sacrifice be forgotten that was somewhat of a lengthy letter but as you can tell it is a subject that should be dear to every one of our hearts in this room to the heart of every american out there that believes in law and justice to every law enforcement family out there that currently has someone in law enfordement or has had a member of their family in law enforcement if we let if we let this kind of violent assassin out of prison after serving only 24 years it will in my opinion be a crippling blow to the message that we need to send to the law enforcement in this country that message really is fairly simple that is that you work as a law enforcement officer to provide as your duty peace and justice in our system and that when eace and justice are attacked in our system our system has a price it has a consequence it has a punishment it is the only way we can uphold the integrity of our system of law enforcement is to have a zero tolerance or a limited tolerance of any type of direct attack against our system of peace and justice the assassination of two federal bureau of investigation agents no matter how many years ago is a direct attack against the legal and justice process in this country i urge all my colleagues to join with me in attempting to be persuasive with the president of the united states and the american public in saying how important it is that this politicalcharade being put on by the defense attorneys for this convicted assassin that this kind of show be stopped that this kind of show be denied their goal their goal of course is to let this convicted assassin walk the streets of america again do not let him hide under the shield of being a native american that is a disgrace to the native americans do not pull native americans down to the level of this convicted killer do not affiliate this convicted killer with the native americans in this country that is an insult in my opinion if we do do not forget the facts of the case just so that i can remind the members let me go through the facts again in a little briefer form than the letter two fbi agents were assassinated they attempted to pursue a vehicle which contained this suspect at the time suspect now a convicted killer leonard peltier they were wounded they were disarmed by the wounds that they had in othef words they could not fight back they didnt have any weapons left to fight back with they were not physically capable one the fbi agents was unconscious the other fbi agent was rendering first aid to the unconscious fbi agent this convicted killer who by the way was a fugitive from justice for the attempted assassination of an offduty police officer in milwaukee walked up to these two fbi agents and executed them in cold blood he was later stopped in a recreational vehicle in that vehicle they found one of the deceased agents pistols in a paper bag that bag had evidence peltiers fingerprints on it peltier was captured in canada he was convicted of two counts of murder for these fbi agents he escaped from the federal prison do not let people tell us this guy is a nonviolent guy he was in federal prison and he shot his way out of federal prison think of the last time since the john dillinger days or bonnie and clyde and so on that somebody shot their way out of the federal prison that is who this individual is now today now today he is in front of the american people in front of the president of the united states asking for mercy look 25 years ago may seem like a long time to some but it has been a real long time for the families of those young fbi agents that were assassinated in cold blood in conclusion on this particular issue let me ask for members support in standing up strong for the law enforcement community of the country in standing up strong for the families and the agents and professionals of the federal bureau of investigation in standing up strong for the concept of peace and justice within the boundaries of our country let us all have our voice heard that in the united states of america if you assassinate a police officer or just as soon two federal bureau of investigation officers you will pay a price and we will stick with the punishment that we deal out we are not a bunch of patsies do not come back to us and think you are going to get a free walk 25 years later after that kind of action if we fail to do this if we fail to do this we are sending the wrong message out there and we are crippling justice and peace in our country i would like to do an update on a couple of other subjects this evening while i have the opportunity to visit with the members as members will recall about 2 or 3 weeks ago maybe a month ago there is a museum in new york city called the brooklyn art museum the brooklyn art museum it was discovered with taxpayer dollars with taxpayer dollars was sponsoring an art exhibit that depicted among other things a portrait of the virgin mary which is one of the holiest symbols of the catholic religion throughout the world and of christianity throughout the world this art museum was allowingin this art exhibit with taxpayer dollars this portrait of the virgin mary with elephant dung as they say crap as i say thrown all over the portrait can members imagine that how long do members think that type of art exhibit would have been tolerated or should have been tolerated in this country at taxpayer dollars if it was an exhibit of martin luther king for example or if it were an exhibit of an outstanding jewish rabbi for example or if it were an exhibit of some other outstanding leader that meant so much to a religious organization anywhere in this world they would not put up with that but for some reason there seems to be some justification out there by some people that an attack on christianity should be separated from an attack say on martin luther king or an attack on the image of a jewish rabbi and so on and so forth what happened is that the mayor of new york city mayor rudy giuliani i think had some guts he stood up and he said we are drawing the line that has gone too far there is a strong freedom of expression in this country there is a first amendment in this country but there is a balance that we have in this country just the same as under the freedom of speech we do not allow individuals to go into a theater and yell fire fire fire we do not allow that that is not a violation of your first amendment rights but we do not allow you to go into a theater and do that we draw a line this thing is not carte blanche this first amendment to do anything that you feel like doing especially when you do it with taxpayer dollars the mayor came under heavy criticism by the very elite that were dealing with the brooklyn art museum the board of directors who i think were acting very pompous in somehow defending this disgraceful work of art not a work of art that is just controversial that brings up lots of discussion but a work of art that hit at the very integrity of a large religious group throughout the world that was the maximum type of insult that you could throw at that particular religion and did it with ainerican taxpayer dollars why do i keep bringing up the fact of american taxpayer dollars because therein lies the distinction as to whether or not this is an issue under the first amendment of our constitution under our constitution frankly had the united states taxpayer dollars not been used to fund this portrait of the virgin mary of which dung was thrown all over it had taxpayer dollars not been used i am afraid to say that this would have been probably protected or would have been protected underthe first amendment we can tolerate that it is horrible and i cannot imagine for example why the first lady hillary clinton stood up for this thing she said however in her comments that while she would not go see it but she certainly stood up for the right to go around and exhibit this with taxpayer dollars iunderstand where some would say it is a first amendment right if there is not taxpayer dollars being used although i can tell the members that the press in this country and the liberal left in this country would not have stood for 2 seconds if it were martin luther king or a jewish rabbi or some other celebrated figure being treated in that fashion but the key here is taxpayer dollars 0 2320 the point here is very clear and i think the citizens of this country i think we need to go out and ask our constituents do the citizens of this country really think it is a justified and constitutionally protected right under the constitution to fund this kind of art with taxpayer dollars or should this type of art be denied the access of taxpayer dollars and allowed to be funded in society with private dollars remember that my objection tonight and the mayor of new york citys objection to this art was not that the art should iot be shown now it is disgraceful do not get me wrong i do not condone this kind of art but there is a constitutionally protected right to show this art without taxpayer dollars that argument has some legitimacy but that was not the debate that is being carried forward here what the mayor said what i said and mr speaker what i think most of our constituents believe is that this kind of art i e the virgin mary with dung splashed all over her with taxpayer dollars has gone over that line you draw a line you have gone over that line do not use taxpayer dollars the brooklyn art museum in new york they could easily fund this through other monies they just want to try and make an issue what they want to do is open that door so that taxpayers in this country will have to pay out of their hardearned dollars will have to use those taxpayer dollars to let the socalled art community especially the elite of the brooklyn art museum fund anything they would like no matter how offensive no matter how derogatory it is that is wrong this art museum knows that it is wrong well there has been a new step a new report to update you on and that is that a federal court judge this week actually came out and said that the art museum has a right to use taxpayer dollars to exhibit this type of art i e the virgin mary with dung thrown all over her in very obviously a disgraceful fashion intended to be as derogatory as possible not only towards christianity but towards one of the most important symbols of christianity i am telling you federal judge you made a mistake you are wrong there is not a constitutionally protected provision that says you can use taxpayer dollars in this country to fund that kind of art why do you not use some common sense why do you have to offend the people of christianity why do you do an allout attack you would not do it with martin luther king and the black community you would not do it in the jewish community with some rabbi of theirs you would not do it with some other type of religious entity or important entity in this country with their leader why are you doing this why do you decide to use taxpayer dollars to offend every christian in the world it is wrong you have got a temporary victory from this federal judge but in the end i think the mayor of new york city one had a lot of guts to do what he did and number two i think he is going to prevail i also think that the general opinion in this country is look that kind of art as violent and as horrible and as disgraceful as it is is protected but not with the use of taxpayer dollars our constituents i do not believe are in any way about to buy the argument that we ought to take the tax dollars out of their paycheck every week and put a percentage of that towards the funding of this kind of art"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a dear colleague

russell mote he was not only my friend he was the members too and a friend of all americans as well as a matter of fact he was a friend to people all over the world i would like to tell the members why bill mote was born in my state of florida in the city of tampa at the turn of the century the world was a far different place for bill mote back in the early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers a vast one at that covering threefourths of the world to bill mote that was just as exciting as man landing on the moon discovering and protecting our oceans became his passion it is not surprising to people who knew bill to understand how his passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries ecology and enhancement at florida state university he also encouraged younger people to become interested in marine life schoolchildren were exposed to the smallest creatures as well as the magnificent sharks and dolphins at mote marine laboratories aquarium a new state of the art marine mammal rescue center gives all visitors a firsthand look at the expert veterinary care that motes marine biologists provide bill will always be remembered as a promoter of education as well as an excellent educator himself he was at the helm when the jason project began at mote marine that was developed as an educational venture between dr ballard and mote marine dr ballard is using jason and jason ii remote submersibles credited with the discoveries of the titanic the bismarck and other landmark discoveries beneath the depths of our oceans mr mote was constantly expanding the depths of our understanding even to the bottom of the sea even larger than his love of the oceans was his love for education he gave not only to the studies of marine biology and oceanography but also relentlessly promoted the fields to youth and professionals alike with his own special blend of enthusiasm in 1968 mr mote was awarded the gold medal of the international oceanographic foundation many of us who knew bill mote have our own stories to tell after meeting a person like bill his energetic and passionate love for the ocean was magnetic his relentless drive passion and vigor was rivaled only by his charismatic personality bill mote was to all of us and will remain in our hearts a true example of what one person can do with a little determination i served on the board of mote marine before i came to congress i had the pleasure of knowing bill mote well he was a devoted husband and brother he was a counselor to marine biologists he was a teacher to all ages of students most of all he was a true conservationist a selfeducated man who saw a need in the world and went ahead to do something about it he definitely graduated life with honors"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a fundamental flaw a fundamental flaw in the bill that passed the senate and in the boehner bill is that it does not address the issue of medical necessity the problem in the erisa plan and that is under erisa law a health plan can define medical necessity in any way they want to the gentlemans bill does nothing to change that he would agree with me on that let me cite an example of why that could be a problem let us say that a health plan sets up its definition for getting psychiatric care saying that somebody has to try to commit suicide three times before one can qualify that may sound absurd but let us just say that the plan does that a little boy goes out a teenager tries to commit suicide once tries to commit suicide twice and finally on the third time commits suicide now under the boehner bill that plan followed its own criteria guess what under the boehner bill and under the bill that passed the senate there is no recourse because erisa says that the health plan can define medical necessity in any way they want to no matter how unreasonable the criteria are or seem to be by an independent panel review panel they still under erisa law cannot change the fact that a health plan could define medical necessity as the cheapest least expensive care we could take a little boy with a cleft palate a health plan could say all we are going to provide treatment for that is a plastic obturator a piece of plastic stuck up into that hole if that is the way the plans employer has defined medical necessity there is no recourse even if it does not fit any prescribed standards of care that is such a fundamental problem
