negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is that really the deal that the democrats would have us sign on to i

appropriations amounts in the bill a percentage reduction at this level will reduce total appropriations in the bill by 300 million down to 9 14 billion this amount would still be nearly 900 million above fiscal year 1987 levels and more than 1 2 billion above the administration request my colleagues will ask why a 300 million cut is the right amount to cut from the interior appropriations bill the response is that a 300 million reduction would reduce by one half the level of increase in appropriations from last year to this year except for the increase in the fillrate of the strategic petroleum reserve last year the congress approved 8 3 billion for the department of interior and related agencies appropriations bill as part of the omnibus continuing resolution this year the committee is recommending a 9 45 billion bill an increase of almost 1 2 billion if one sets aside the decision to provide 600 million in strategic reserve funds this leaves an increase in discretionary spending of approximately 600 million the amendment i am offering would cut this increase in half i believe my amendment is necessary to compensate for the blatantly artificial and unrealistic assumptions made by the budget conference agreement this budget agreement assumes 7 2 billion in revenues from early payment of rea loans my colleagues know that this is not going to happen in todays interest rate market is the rea going to go out and borrow private money to repay subsidized public funds of course not this 7 2 billion savings is no savings at all another assumption is that congress is going to raise nearly 20 billion in taxes this year the conference agreement assumes that 1988 revenues will be in the range of 932 billion is this really going to happen are twothirds of my colleagues in the house and twothirds of the members of the other body going to put their names on the line to6 override a presidential veto of a tax increase that is what it would take to raise 16 billion in taxes this year i dont think its going to happen finally the conference agreement reconciles only 4 billion of the 30 billion savings requiired for fiscal year 1988 my colleagues know that the amount of unreconciled savings slips and slips and slips through the budget process is this year going to be any different i dont think so mr chairman i think it is clear that we have nearly 30 billion in furmy money in the budget resolution in order to reduce this funny money a bipartisan group of members have gotten together and agreed that congress needs to make the tough choices to achieve real deficit reduction our goal is to reduce this funny money by around one half or 15 billion this works out to be a need for approximately a 300 million reduction in the interior appropriations bill this is what my amendment does it simply reduces each and every appropriated amount by 3 2 percent i recognize the concerns of some of my colleagues that this is a meat ax approach well weve tried the scalpelweve tried to make careful measured cuts in programs weve tried to work with members of the committee to achieve 300 million in reductions but our efforts have not been successful given the urgency and enormity of our deficit problems maybe its time for a small and clean mr tidy 3 2 percent meat ax that i was accused of throwing away on the last

whether there are insufficient funds in some programs and not others and then without waiting to see what that agency does assigns the money appropriates the money and spends the money this amendment puts the horse back in front where it belongs and really implements the will of the authors of this bill it says that this interagency commission which now has 30 days to report back to the congress under the wording of the bill would simply have 6 months to do so but that no money shall be spent under the appropriations until that agency which this bill creates reports back to the congress and determines whether or not there has been overlapping whether or not there has been overspending in any or underspending in any and if that report confirms the levels of funding that appear in the main body of this bill then that will be the end of it and the appropriation will take place if the money is too much in one area because of overlapping then the congress will have another opportunity to cut back on that one to meet the needs on the funding that is already in place members of the committee my amendment will do no harm to the commitment that we have to the homeless because the stream of funding that is already in the pipeline will continue to flow it simply means that in order to make sure that we have the right amounts in the right places that we are going to wait until the

indecisiveness and procrastination on the part of congress relative to the budget process while we had an omnibus continuing resolution that contained all federal spending last year at least that cr was enacted by midoctober 1986 only a couple weeks after the start of the fiscal year this years bickering for 3 months after the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require each full year appropriations bill to be passed by congress individually and sent to the president in that form in lieu of separate movement of appropriations bills i have also cosponsored congressman mickey edwards bill h r 3199 that would require separation of any cr into the 13 individual appropriations bills upon presention to the president for signature i would hope that in view of the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many americans to sacrifice for the good of fiscal responsibility the least that members of congress can do is to contribute their 2 percent cola to that effort this legislation also contains language applauded by environmental groups that allows an 8month delay in sanctions for noncompliance with clean air act standards on ozone and carbon monoxide emissions this will pressure congress to reauthorize the clean air act this coming year instead of letting it slip into the next congress as some members had wished the cr also contains a provision that is very important to our nations dairy farmers the conferees on the agriculture appropriations section have included the text of my bill that will ensure that grammrudman sequestration does not unfairly impact dairy farmers back in 1986 congress and the president approved legislation i introduced h r 4188 public law 99260 to correct a flaw in the original grammrudman that would have cost dairymen 360 million in lost income in order to produce only 80 million in budget savings unfortunately in approving this years grammrudman fix the conferees neglected to incorporate this change senator bob kasten who was also instrumental in helping gain passage of public law 99260 back in 1986 inserted the language of h r 3344 in the senate version of the agriculture

strikingly clear particularly in the northeast the decline of highelevation forests in vermont is well documented as is the acidification of hundreds of lakes throughout the northeast most recently sugar maple trees in vermont have been dying at an alarming rate acid rain is threatening to turn vermontthe green mountain state and the home of maple syrupinto the brown mountain state with sour syrup dead lakes and stunted trees despite the abundance of evidence vermonters are repeatedly told that more study is necessary but i dont think vermont sportsmen maple producers and outdoorsmen would agree and scientific experts dont either their message is the science does support the bill last august the epa released the preliminary results of its eastern lakes survey which showed startling new signs of damage in the east over 1 000 lakes are dead and over 4 000 lakes have virtually no buffering capacity left to neutralize acid rain the presitigious national academy of sciences has found a direct link between sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain damage in a march 1986 report the nas concluded that a casual relationship exists between so2 emissions and acidification of lakes in the admirondacks research conducted by the unitedstates forest service made public at a senate envionment and public works committee hearing last december turned up alarming declines in growth through the southeastern united states in yellow pines an important commercial species the regional survey of southern pine stands found growth reductions of 40 to 50 percent over the last 20 years this study is significant for two critically important reasons first it illustrates that acid rain is not exclusively a northeastern problem florida lakes and southern appalachian forest are dying while fragile alpine environments in the west are also threatened second this study is especially significant because it illustrates the economic costs of not acting to reduce acid rain opponents of the bill complain loudly about the cost of reducing emissions but they ignore the costs of inaction forest decline could have a devastating economic impact on the forest products industry in the east in addition a draft study prepared by epa brookhaven national laboratory and the army corps of engineers estimated that materials damage to statues monuments and historical buildings may be as high as 6 billion per year if congress weighs the costs of action against the costs of inaction i am confident that congress will move expeditiously and favorably on this legislation after 4 years and a number of approaches we have finally developed an acid rain bill which can pass the house of representatives h r 4567 as approved by the health and environment subcommittee will mandate the emissions reductions necessary to curb acid rain and it will give the states maximum flexibility in achieving these emissions reductions this bill has several advantages the first is flexibility the bill mandates tough new statewide average emissions standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the governor of each state will have the flexibility to choose from a wide array of options to meet this statewide emissions standard the bill does not mandate scrubbers in many states switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur coal will be sufficient to meet the emissions standard by providing this flexibility h r 4567 will promote leastcost methods of meeting emissions standards and saving ratepayers millions of dollars the flexibility of h r 4567 also allows governors concerned about the loss of highsulfur coal jobs to preserve these jobs the second criterion is ratepayer protection the bill would create a pollution control trust fund with a small fee on fossil fuel power produced in or imported into the untied states this trust fund would be used to cap residential rate increases attributable to the bill to no more than 10 percent this fee would increase the average residential customers monthly rate by an average of only 25 to 50 cents per month the inclusion of this provision in the bill illustrates the willingness of the sponsors to reduce to the extent possible the regional inequity in rate impacts the third and most important criterion large and meaningful reductions recent scientific evidence suggests that reductions of sulfur dioxide alone is not enough to ensure the future protection of our forests lakes and streams in addition to a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide our bill requires a 4millionton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions nitrogen oxide is a precursor of ozone which has been linked to forest decline and crop damage in numerous studies nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by tightening emissions standards on cars and trucks the tough emissions reductions contained in h r 4567 will insure that our forests lakes and streams do not meet a fate similar to those in europe this is the year for acid rain legislation this

over 200 years we have had october 4 1988 discussions and debate on whether or not the members of the unitedstates house and the unitedstates senate should be limited in the number of terms that they might serve obviously they are not limited at the present time but many of us feel that it would serve this countrys best interest now more than ever if those terms were limited in 1980 when i was first elected to congrese i believed that and i believe it even more today in 1980 i introduced a resolution in congress calling on this body and on the public to have a constitutional amendment to limit congress to six 2year terms in the house and two ayear terms in the senate i also introduced a resolution that was a companion to that as an alternative that called for three 4year house terms and two 6yeat senate terms as a constitutionally mandated limit we limit the term of our president why do we not limit the terms of our house and our senate well there are a lot of reasons i suppose politically why that is not very palatable for this body to do to itself or to do to the voters but it is something this year in particular because we have just gone through a celebration of the constitutions anniversary it is noteworthy that in the republican convention in our platform one of my former colleagues from south carolina tommy hartnet offered in the resolution forum of the platform a particular provision that to the best of my knowledge and our research has never been offered before in any convention of any political party in the history of our country and it was adopted in that portion of the platform dealing with term limitation it reads as follows we favor a constitutional amendment which will place some restrictions on the number of consecutive terms a man or woman may serve in the unitedstates house of representatives or the unitedstates senate so this evening i thought it was appropriate to talk about that for a little bit to see what we might join together to do about this process and perhaps to gain some new adherents to the purposes and objectives of this term limitation concept the earliest proposed constitutional amendment to limit was introduced in the first congress in 1789 the resolution n that congress stipulated that no person could serve more than 6 years in an 8year period actually the concept predated the constitution the continental congress adopted a proposal by john dixon of delaware in 1777 limiting delegates tinder the articles of confederation to serving 3 years in any 6year period however after the first congress the issue of limiting terms laid dormant until the mid1940s the primary reason for this dormancy was in the early years of our country to serve only 2 years in the unitedstates house and then retire nobody served longer than that they just did not as late as the 1840s 40 to 50 percent of the congress left office after each election 40 to 50 percent as late as the 1840s from 1860 to 1920 the average length of service doubled from 4 to 8 years by 1901 when the 57th congress convened for the first time less than 30 percent of its members were freshmen in 1981 when the 97th congress convened only 17 percent of the unitedstates house of representatives were freshmen a remarkably low number i think most of us are aware that with increasing frequency we reelect incumbents i think last time we had an election in this country a couple of years ago we reelected 98 percent of our colleagues back to the house there are some who think we will reelect approximately that percentage again this time i do not think that is healthy for our nation we need new ideas vigorous concerns here not just a question of some of the issues we are going to talk about tonight that might otherwise be a good idea why we should limit the terms of congressmen but just for the sake of getting bright new faces in this body with greater frequency than simply based upon a retirement prospect perhaps the most significant growth issue in this whole idea has been the public support for the concept in 1946 a gallup poll showed 40 percent of the american public favored lengthening the terms of house members to 4 years by 1961 51 percent of the public supported 4year terms and this was about the same in 1977 however in the most recent gallup poll published in the washington post on may 17 1981 a clear 59 percent of the american people supported the lengthening of terms of house members to 4 years that same poll showed that by a margin of better than 2 to 1 the american people want to limit unitedstates senators and representatives to a maximum of 12 years in office i think that is the most important issue of this it does not seem to me that the two should be separated but there are some who strongly do not believe in the lengthening of house terms but whatever the case may be those of us who support the concept of lengthening terms also support the concept of limiting them and those who join us only on that issue i must say to them that i think that this is the single most issue important issue and that is the one that we are here to talk about tonight the simple fact is that the concern of most congressmen for getting reelected causes them to spend a good deal of time and energy on matters related to that and that is unfortunately what all of us do that influences the decisionmaking away from what otherwise would be the course of better judgment in many cases not all case but in many cases a limitation on terms would assure that a substantial portion of congress at any time would be ineligible for reelection and vitually unfettered by the constraints of reelection in addition to limiting terms if there were a lengthening of terms i think the effect would be even greater the bottom line is simply that there is not enough time for us to do all the duties that are expected of us today as opposed to back in 1840 or 1900 or 1940 for that matter we have career congressmen back in the early days of this country we found people who served were really here for only a couple months a year in fact well into the 1940s and 1950s it was the practice to stay no more than 3 months a year at one time not very long ago it was 6 months now it is a yearround proposition and it is very difficult to find anyone who could conceive of congressmen going back home after a couple months here and working in other jobs they do not do that and that is really the most seriouz problem when coupled with the pressaires that come with todays society that is really the bottom line problem we are career oriented here once you get elected to congress at a certain stage of your life and you are here it is like any other job there is a security blanket factor there is a great desire to be reelected instead of going back out into public life while for some people and for the public in some instances that is a great service a great sacrifice as a matter of fact for many others and for the public as a whole i think that it is not it is jnst tile opposite of that but the fact of life is that you are not going to change we are not going to change the business of congress there are so many issues so many subject matters to be brought up the government of the united states has grown so large that a yearround functioning body is really a necessity and i think it will always be with us but coming with that comes again this pressure for remaining here this desire this lack of going back and being reinvigorated by going back to a job and being a businessman in a business somewhere back home or being a doctor or a lawyer or whatever the profession is and then staying here year after year and getting somewhat isolated from it it is a difficult thing but that is what has happened and unless we limit the terms of congressmen we are going to continue to see this trend and it will not be an easy one to break coming along with that come the pressures o fundraise the pressures that come on us in the voting process when it comes to making a decision on what is the best thing to do i remember when i was here in the first term of congress there was a vote on the question of funding for libraries in this country nobody is against libraries there was a 10 million program that had come out of lyndon johnsons great society 10 million a year not billion but million now that is a lot of money to me and to you and to everybody else but by the way we do things around here 10 million a year is not comparatively a lot of money there was a proposal to eliminate that program and that proposal was supported by a number of the original adherents of it saying really the purpose of the federal government is not to support libraries that is a comnmunity thing back home the reason we had the 10 million was to get the rural libraries going to stimulate libraries to be started and we have done most all we need to do in that regard and if we are going to get this budget of ours in balance it is time that we proceed and do something about that and go ahead and eliminate this program well it came to a vote on the floor here i remember some of my good conservative colleagues as well as others here in this body scratching their heads a minute and i heard a murmuring around the room here as that vote was in progress you know we ought to get rid of this thing it isnt serving any purpos6 it has already done what its supposed to do we have seeded some rural libraries but you know i wonder what the friends of the library back home would think of me if i were to go on record and appear to have voted against libraries so our friends my colleagues voted overwhelmingly despite the recommendations of even the authors of that proposal and the original adherents to it voted overwhelmingly to continue the funding of that 10 million a year program that is one small example of what goes on here that is indeed a real big problem for us so that is one of many reasons why i became convinced more so than ever after i got here that we ought to limit the terms of congresmen in this body and get back to more of a citizen legislator and have an opportunity for there to be a relief of that pressure so that there is not so much a concern about what is somebody back home over every little issue going to think of how i did it and more concern of what is right and what should be done in restricting the budget and getting some common sense back into the government that is just one of a number of reasons i have had a number of my good friends who have supported this concept since we all came together here in 1980 who are with us tonight one of them is the gentleman from oregon mr denny smritm the gentleman looks like he is wanting me to yield to

house to the president of the united states urging him to begin negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is

there is money wasted whether there are insufficient funds in some programs and not others and then without waiting to see what that agency does assigns the money appropriates the money and spends the

the worst case of indecisiveness and procrastination on the part of congress relative to the budget process while we had an omnibus continuing resolution that contained all federal spending last year at least that cr was enacted by midoctober 1986 only a couple weeks after the start of the fiscal year this years bickering for 3 months after the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require each full year appropriations bill to be passed by congress individually and sent to the president in that form in lieu of separate movement of appropriations bills i have also cosponsored congressman mickey edwards bill h r 3199 that would require separation of any cr into the 13 individual appropriations bills upon presention to the president for signature i would hope that in view of the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many americans to sacrifice for the good of fiscal responsibility the least that members of congress can do is to contribute their 2 percent cola to that effort this legislation also contains language applauded by environmental groups that allows an 8month delay in sanctions for noncompliance with clean air act standards on ozone and carbon monoxide emissions this will pressure congress to reauthorize the clean air act this coming year instead of letting it slip into the next congress as some members had wished the cr also contains a provision that is very important to our nations dairy farmers the conferees on the agriculture appropriations section have included the text of my bill that will ensure that grammrudman sequestration does not unfairly impact dairy farmers back in 1986 congress and the president approved legislation i introduced h r 4188 public law 99260 to correct a flaw in the

our environment has become strikingly clear particularly in the northeast the decline of highelevation forests in vermont is well documented as is the acidification of hundreds of lakes throughout the northeast most recently sugar maple trees in vermont have been dying at an alarming rate acid rain is threatening to turn vermontthe green mountain state and the home of maple syrupinto the brown mountain state with sour syrup dead lakes and stunted trees despite the abundance of evidence vermonters are repeatedly told that more study is necessary but i dont think vermont sportsmen maple producers and outdoorsmen would agree and scientific experts dont either their message is the science does support the bill last august the epa released the preliminary results of its eastern lakes survey which showed startling new signs of damage in the east over 1 000 lakes are dead and over 4 000 lakes have virtually no buffering capacity left to neutralize acid rain the presitigious national academy of sciences has found a direct link between sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain damage in a march 1986 report the nas concluded that a casual relationship exists between so2 emissions and acidification of lakes in the admirondacks research conducted by the unitedstates forest service made public at a senate envionment and public works committee hearing last december turned up alarming declines in growth through the southeastern united states in yellow pines an important commercial species the regional survey of southern pine stands found growth reductions of 40 to 50 percent over the last 20 years this study is significant for two critically important reasons first it illustrates that acid rain is not exclusively a northeastern problem florida lakes and southern appalachian forest are dying while fragile alpine environments in the west are also threatened second this study is especially significant because it illustrates the economic costs of not acting to reduce acid rain opponents of the bill complain loudly about the cost of reducing emissions but they ignore the costs of inaction forest decline could have a devastating economic impact on the forest products industry in the east in addition a draft study prepared by epa brookhaven national laboratory and the army corps of engineers estimated that materials damage to statues monuments and historical buildings may be as high as 6 billion per year if congress weighs the costs of action against the costs of inaction i am confident that congress will move expeditiously and favorably on this legislation after 4 years and a number of approaches we have finally developed an acid rain bill which can pass the house of representatives h r 4567 as approved by the health and environment subcommittee will mandate the emissions reductions necessary to curb acid rain and it will give the states maximum flexibility in achieving these emissions reductions this bill has several advantages the first is flexibility the bill mandates tough new statewide average emissions standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the governor of each state will have the flexibility to choose from a wide array of options to meet this statewide emissions standard the bill does not mandate scrubbers in many states switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur coal will be sufficient to meet the emissions standard by providing this flexibility h r 4567 will promote leastcost methods of meeting emissions standards and saving ratepayers millions of dollars the flexibility of h r 4567 also allows governors concerned about the loss of highsulfur coal jobs to preserve these jobs the second criterion is ratepayer protection the bill would create a pollution control trust fund with a small fee on fossil fuel power produced in or imported into the untied states this trust fund would be used to cap residential rate increases attributable to the bill to no more than 10 percent this fee would increase the average residential customers monthly rate by an average of only 25 to 50 cents per month the inclusion of this provision in the bill illustrates the willingness of the sponsors to reduce to the extent possible the regional inequity in rate impacts the third and most important criterion large and meaningful reductions recent scientific evidence suggests that reductions of sulfur dioxide alone is not enough to ensure the future protection of our forests lakes and streams in addition to a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide our bill requires a 4millionton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions nitrogen oxide is a precursor of ozone which has been linked to forest decline and crop damage in numerous studies nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by tightening emissions standards on cars and trucks the tough emissions reductions contained in h r 4567 will insure that our forests lakes and streams do not meet a fate similar to those in europe this is the year for acid rain legislation this approach has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the new england governors conference it has also been strongly endorsed by the league of women voters the league of conservation voters the sierra club the national audubon society the national clean air coalition and numerous other groups i urge all members to join this bipartisan effort by supporting my amendment"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as is often thecase in this body we appear to be headed in the direction of taking an oversimplified approach to solving a complex problem this time it happens to be in the form of trade protectionism to be included in h r 3 the omnibus trade bill of 1987 it would be nice if our trade deficit problem could be solved by slapping on import quotas or raising import duties it sounds easy and for some it makes good political sense but there is no getting around the fact that protectionism is bad public policy trade protectionism raises prices for ameri can consumers limits their freedom of choice and removes incentives for american industry to continue with their efforts to become more competitive a particularly troublesome problem with protectionist measures at this time is that the countries theyre aimed at are some of our best agricultural export customers in the current world market glutted with agricultural commodities our agricultural exports are extremely vulnerable to the retailatory action that would result from trade protectionism the agricultural export markets we currently enjoy and badly need to expand would simply shift to other exporting countries i am urging my colleagues to keep in mind that in the long run protectionist measures cannot and will not lead to a more open world marketplace particularly for agricultural exports this approach is a fundamental contradiction of the purpose of trade legislation and should be rejected by this congress"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "at the outset let me first of all congratulate the chairman of the committee on the judiciary and the appropriate subcommittees along with the ranking minority members of those subcommittees for a piece of legislation that i think has long been needed in this country i am of course talking about the omnibus drug control bill it will go a long way ini beginning to build some controls on the streets and education with our young people that is so critically necessary to fight this national plague let me address myself though specifically to title vi subsqction 6503 this is an important issue and an important area and i have to believe that the subcommittee on crime in large part added a portion to this legislation that is if not needed at least unworkable i am talking about a 7day waiting period on handguns this morning i was privileged to introduce 115 rankandfile cops on the beat you could call them from over 27 states in this nation they came here to lobby they came here to lobby us membprs of congress on this legislation not in opposition to the omnibus crime control bill but certainly in opposition to this section because as they said so clearly this morning it will not deter the criminal it will be the honest lawabiding citizen that might be without a gun or that will be limited in his or her right to acquire a gun while the criminal the drug dealer on the street will still be bzying his gun from behind the bar for an exorbitant amount of money because he has it or out of the back of a car that moves into a community to sell handguns to young kids on the street that are pushing crack that is really the issue i hope as we debate this bill and as we move toward amendments that we will look at some reasonable alternatives that are valuable to us as we move to amend this important legislation i hope when we arrive at this section we will look most clearly at the mccollum alternative or the mccollum substitute that will devise a mechanism by which we will be able to track and identify those individuas who are criminals attempt ing to acquire a gun that really is the issue here to take guns away from criminals and not take guns away from lawabiding citizens or in sorne way to restrict the right of the individual lawabiding citizen to do so we have provided positive alternatives for the lawenforcement community alternatives that 115 rankandfile cops on the street supported and endorsed today as they came to lobby us here let us make the appropriate amendments pass this most important legislation for our country and hopefully improve the climate on the streets for the young people
