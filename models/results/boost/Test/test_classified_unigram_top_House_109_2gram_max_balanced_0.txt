couple of comments the gentleman from arizona said you cannot expect the postal service to give back any of its monopoly powers with all due respect the postal service has agreed to this bill in this

argue about the needs for reform in pilot tests and such but maybe it was an inadvertent step but the fact still remains the amendment before the committee today will be a suspension of the criminal

the legi slation i hail its passage but title vi of this legislation is drawn from a bill that i introduced in the first session of the 109th congress my legislation is known as the child pornography prevention act of 2005 and as the title states the intent of my legislation is to prevent american chjldren from becoming victims of pornography every one of us knows that the fuel that fires the wicked hearts of child predators is child pornography and it must be confronted in america every day in this country children are sadly exploited in pornographic enterprises sometimes b those closest to them believe it or not in their homes sometimes by commercial producers in the home children are forced to pose for pornographic pictures or act in pornographic videos sometimes by family members and even friends and caretakers and other trusted individuals sadly our resources in the law enforcement community inform us that these pictures and videos are posted on the internet or surreptitiously spread to sexual predators in the commercial arena and in hollywood as our cultures become more and more youth oriented and sex has become more and more prevalent we must ensure that children are not being used in the production of prurient material and provide law enforcement with the tools to prosecute those who exploit children a main tenet of my legislation is the language that will fix a technicality known as home pornographers to get at the first problem that i just described home pornographers have used this loophole to evade federal prosecution in child pornography cases these individuals will use digital cameras polaroid cameras video cameras to make pornographic images of children download them and distributethem on the internet my legislation first and foremost makes it clear that federal prosecutions of home pornographers may proceed in federal court because their activities impact on interstate commerce another element of my bill which has become in many ways more controversial is the addition of a new section of the criminal code section 2257a which adds a recordkeeping requirement that will force people in even in the entertainment industry to keep records of the names and ages of their subjects along with proof of their identification when they are engaged even in simulated sexual activity on screen anytime hollywood uses a simulated sex act in a soap opera a cable television show a movie or other production a record must be kept to show that a child was not used even in the creation of a simulated sex act heretofore the law has only required that such records be kept in the cases of hardcore pornography where actual sex was being performed and recorded for entertainment value but if a child is used in a simulated sex act the impact of such abuse on that child is in many ways just as real as it would be had the production involved actual sexual contact therefore my bill require these records be kept for simulated sex because by doing so certain bad actors in the entertainment industry will be deterred from using children also my bill goes a step further by requiring that records be kept even in the case of what is known as lascivious exhibition once again no child should be used in either nude pictures or sexually explicit materials or even in activities that have a prurient interest this is again the type of images that fuel the flames of the wicked hearts of child predators and should be stopped finally the legislation expands the ability of investigators and prosecutors to pursue the people who are used to distribute child pornography these distributors also will be required to follow these new recordkeeping provisions and this will provide law enforcement with a powerful tool against them as well providing law enforcement with the tools to combat child pornography contained in my legislation is a muchneeded and overdue step that must be taken to protect our children from those in society who have no decency and no shame i also commend those legitimate producers of entertainment products in the united states of america with whom we have had dialogue and with whom we have worked in the development of this legislation it is not my purpose in any way to suggest that those that are involved in the legitimate entertainment industry in this country have anything to do with the illegitimate industry that is pornography in america nevertheless it is important that even in main street hollywood america that we ensure that children are not used even in the creation of entertainment materials that simulate sex acts and our legislation will create the recordkeeping to prevent just that i hail the passage of the child pornography prevention act as a part of the child

subcommittee of the japanese food safety commission on prions which deals primarily with bse or mad cow disease voted to pursue a course designed to open japans borders to unitedstates beef this is something that the beef industry has been waiting for for about 1 year 12 years now and the full committee will vote tomorrow on opening trade with the united states and then this will begin a 4week comment period afterwhich it is assumed that borders will open so we are hoping that by the end of the year we will see unitedstates beef going to japan this is certainly important for our beef industry because japan was buying at one time roughly 1 7 billion of unitedstates beef annually so it is a huge portion of our beef trade getting the border open has been surprisingly difficult however we had two cases of bse in north america that shut off trade with japan japan has had numerous cases of bse in recent years our current testing system would detect one bsepositive cow out of 10 million healthy cows with a 99 percent probability so the odds of a bse cow getting through our present system is practically nil so it is a very reliable system contrast this with the scenario currently going on with the european union in 2004 last year there were 756 cases of bse in the european union 756 whereas in all of north america there have been no more than four or five cases in the last 3 years there have been 189 102 cases of bse in europe since bse was first found several years ago so it has been a huge amount of trouble that they have had yet the united states has experienced practically no exports of our beef to europe one would think with that scenario that we would have had a tremendous export opportunity the european union has blocked unitedstatesbeef in violation of wto rules also has blocked our pork our poultry and genetically modifiedcrops so the european union certainly has not been a good trading partner and they have as i mentioned violated wto rules in doing so the net agriculture trade deficit between the united states and the european union was a minus 5 billion last year so we have taken a big hit in this area current trade talks with the european union are very important and we have an excellent trade ambassador rob portman who is doing a great job and we have great confidence in him but currently we have an offer on the table which is one by which we would reduce our amber box our farm subsidies by 60 percent from 19 billion to roughly 7 5 billion we have asked the european union to reduce their trade subsidies by 83 percent from 80 billion down to 15 billion the eu has countered with an offer to reduce their export subsidies and also their farm subsidies to 39 percent which is certainly not a very satisfactory counteroffer as a result we are somewhat concerned about their response to this whole situation it seems that tariffs certainly need to be equalized between the unitedstates and the european union currently our tariffs on goods going into the european union are roughly 30 percent their goods coming into the united states are roughly 12 percent so here these two large trading partners with economies of somewhere in the 9 trillion to 11 trillion range still have a great dichotomy in terms of the actual tariffs that are being charged against the unitedstates versus the eu the important thing to realize is if these trade agreements are formalized and if they do come into being this will certainly change the nature and structure of our current farm bill a note of caution here brazil is waiting there and seeing what is going to happen their land is roughly 10 percent of our land value their labor costs are about 5 percent of our value so if we reduce our farm programs they are going to be a formidable competitor we certainly think our farmers can compete with anyone in the world but when the playing field is that unequal it can be a problem so it is really important that we realize that trade agreements are tremendous if they are hoiored and if the playing field is equal but they can be huge liabilities if one side honors the agreements and the other does not so far with the european union that has been pretty much the situation so in congress we need to look at the next wto round very carefully"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "yes i would"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "yes i claim time in

and historic legislation that will come before the congress tomorrow the senat has already passed legislation reforming class action lawsuit abuses and now the house of representatives will take it up and pass it and send it to the president of the united states why is this such a historic occasion because abuses in class actions have been going on for many years in fact this house has worked for over 6 years to reform this difficulty and get to the point where we are today this legislation has passed the house of representatives in each of the last three congresses but each time it was stymied in the united states senate the fact of the matter is that as the legislation progressed through the house it got more and more votes more and more bipartisan support but never could get the threshold needed to pass in the other body that has now changed the senate has passed legislation it is a little different from what the house has passed in the past but it holds the same core principle of reforming the abuses that are taking place today all across the country with class action lawsuits some of these abuses are absolutely startling in a nationwide class action lawsuit filed in alabama against the bank of boston over mortgage escrow accounts the class members won the case but actually lost money under the settlement agreement the 700 000 class members received small payments of just a couple of dollars or no money at all about a year later they found out that anywhere from 90 to 140 had been deducted from their escrow accounts to pay their lawyers legal feels of 8 5 million in other words they had to pay more than they have received in settlement in order to satisfy multimillion dollar attorneys fees when som of those class members sued their class action lawyers for malpractice the lawyers countersued them for 25 million saying their former clients were trying to harass them in another classic case in the settlement of a class action lawsuit in madison county illinois against thompson consumer electronics over alleged faulty television sets consumers were eligible for rebates on future purchases ranging in value from 25 to 50 if you spent more than 100 on a thompson electronics product so in other words your settlements was a coupon to buy more of what was alleged to being defective in the first place how did the attorneys do well the attorneys pocketed 22 million in attorneys fees some consumers reportedly walked away from the settlement altogether because the form was so complicated and the attorneys fees were so high recently president bush had down at the commerce department a forum to discuss these abuses and one of these plaintiffs in this thompson electronics case was there and after explaining what she had been through and the frustration of having a television set that did not work and being represented in a class action that did not work and winding up with a coupon to buy something she did not want to buy and seeing the attorneys get 22 million in attorneys fees she said where is the justice in that the fact of the matter is there is no justice in our current class action system and it is in effect a racket how did we get to this point well it has to do with a problem with our federal laws when our founding fathers wrote our constitution they very wisely provided for a federal judiciary a judiciary that could hear cases from different people in different states so that if in the founding of our country and ever since people felt that they might not be treated as fairly in a foreign jurisdiction in a court across the country somewhere far from where they have lived they could have the opportunity to remove it to the federal courts where they would in theory get more impartial tieatment this has persisted for the entire history of our country however our founding fathers never heard of class action lawsuits they are a 20thcentury development and they are not without their merit class actions afford efficiencies to our courts because if people have an identical claim against one or more defendants they can be consolidated into a class and brought before the court in an efficient manner and sometimes these cases involve hundreds of thousands or even millions of plaintiffs this legislation does nothing to affect the right of people to bring their class action lawsuits in state courts or federal courts but under the original establishment of our federal courts this diversity jurisdiction of the courts where you had parties from different states disputing each other had to set a minimum amount before you could bring the case into courts and over the years that number has risen to 75 000 per plaintiff so in other words if a person who lives in my state of virginia has an injury in the state of maryland across the potomac river and they bring a lawsuit in the state court if that case involves more than 75 000 in damages the case can be removed to the federal courts however when you apply that rule to class actions it is the same it is 75 000 but it is per plaintiff so if you have a million plaintiffs in a case you have to multiply by one million times 75 000 or show a 75 billion case in order to get into federal court that is wrong that a 75 000 simple case that can easily be handled in the state courts would be entitled to the federal courts and a 75 billion case or say a 70 billion case less than the 75 billion threshold there cannot get into the federal courts it is wrong it should be corrected and this legislation does it in a very simple fashion instead of 75 000 per plaintiff it is 5 million but 5 million for the entire class all the claims added together and this will mean that no longer will you have what is called forum shopping taking place where the plaintiffs attorneys can choose the jurisdiction they want to bring the case in and keep it there why is that significant because we have over 4 000 jurisdictions across the country 4 000 different state jurisdictions sometimes simple county governments sometimes a collection of counties within a state but 4 000 different places where you can bring a lawsuit the plaintiffs attorneys and there are only a small number of plaintiffs attorneys who handle these big class action lawsuits the plaintiffs attorneys know which of those 4 000 jurisdictions maybe a dozen maybe two dozen of them are overwhelmingly biased and favorable to the plaintiffs in a class action there was one state court county in alabama a few years ago where more nationwide class action lawsuits were considered in that one county than the entire federal judiciary of more than 600 district court judges combined that is an abuse today the same thing takes place in other jurisdictions around the country and this legislation would correct that more importantly it would treat all the parties fairly because not only could the defendants remove a case to federal courts but any or all of the plaintiffs in the case would also have the right to remove that case to federal court under appropriate circumstances the judge would have discretion if the case looked like it really did principally involve people in one state it would be kept in that state but if it clearly is a nationwide class action lawsuit it can be moved to federal court where it will get more evenhanded treatment and a more standard application of the law then these select jurisdictions that are getting all the class action cases today that is what the problem is in addition to changing the jurisdictional requirements there are also other things that will make it easier for plaintiffs to be treated fairly and defendants to be treated fairly as well the washington post is one of more than 100 newspapers around the country that have endorsed this legislation and they said it so wisely a few years ago they have been supporting this for a long time we do not often on our side of the aisle cite the washington post but this gives you an idea of how serious this problem is and how widespread the support for this problem is the clients get token payments while the lawyers get enormous fees

dismissing this approach i urge my colleagues to examine the reforms mandated and the flexibility inherent in the legislation first the reforms title i requires management and budgetary reforms to create a more streamlined efficient and effective organization it shifts funding mechanisms for 18 programs of the u n from the regular assessed budget to voluntarily funded programs in an effort to make these programs more accountable to those who fund them it calls for budgetary practices that would allow us to measure the effectiveness and relevance of programs and it creates an independent oversight board an office of ethics and a chief operating officer to increase the accountability of the u n this title also addresses the shameful antisemitism inherent in u n structures by calling for israel to have a permanent seat in one of the regional groups with all the accompanying rights and privileges and it requires the state department to review u n agencies that focus exclusively on the palestinian agenda title ii deals with the human rights mandate of the u n it establishes basic criteria that member states must meet to be eligible to serve on u n human rights bodies and requires the u n entity that selects members on these bodies to abide by these criteria title iii mandates reforms of the international atomic energy agency so that it can better focus on the key issues of nuclear safety and security and nuclear verification activities title iv calls for a review of u n peacekeeping operations and requires that the unitedstates deny support for new or expanded missions until procedures are in place to prevent further sexual exploitation by u n peacekeepers these measures including adopting a code of conduct for all personnel participating in these operations and establishing a data base so that past abusers are not able to participate in future operations have been specifically endorsed by the secretary generals special advisor on sexual exploitation and abuse and should be in place by this summer yet it is incumbent upon us to ensure that they are not stalled by member states that dont see this tragic situation as a serious problem title v puts forward ways to improve budget practices by requiring more details about the u n budget including proposed increases to be presented to congress and finally title vi provides the leverage if i could come up with a better way i would pursue it wholeheartedly but even the strongest supporters of the unitedstates u n relationship acknowledge that the only way the u n pays attention to calls for reform is when its budget is threatened experience has shown that the u n will institute needed improvements only when congress threatens to withhold unitedstates funding this is not meant to be draconian these reforms if implemented will increase the credibility the legitimacy and the effectiveness of the u n in fact i want to underscore the importance i place on a united nations that can fulfill its core objectiveto serve as an institution that supports the preservation of international peace and security i feel this objective is at risk finally it is important to highlight the flexibility that is built into this legislation it allows the administration 2 years to work with the u n to make these necessary reforms before the withholding provision is triggered even after 2 years it does not insist that every one of the reforms be implemented but allows an additional year for the u n to complete the job if the u n adopts measures that achieve the same purpose as those outlined in this bill it allows the full unitedstates contribution to be expended and if the u n chooses not to implement these needed reforms the legislation authorizes the contributions that are withheld from expenditure to remain available until the u n acts in 1949 dean acheson said that the united states must work actively to make the united nations an effective instrument of international cooperation there is and always will be a role for america in ensuring that the u n lives up to the ideals of its charter by pushing for these critical reforms i believe that we can forge the u n into the effective instrument of international cooperation that we all hope it can be it is my belief that this legislation is the instrument to get the job doneto make the u n the organization that its founders envisioned 60 years ago i yield the floor"]], "top_unsure": [[0.5, 0.0, 0, "3 weeks ago i had the opportunity t meet and discuss the situation on our borders with the members of the minute men project these dedicated individuals reaffirmed my concerns that illegal immigrants are crossing our borders in record numbers they fear that any amnesty or free citizenship bill will only reward andentice more illegal immigration i agree therefore as congress moves closer to a substantial debate on immigration reform it is important that we not consider any guest worker or amnesty proposal until the administration makes a concerted effort to secure our borders and enforce our laws and congress passes legislation that allows local and state officials to act as immigration deputies the

has run short irans government knows of this critical weakness they have reviewed the congressional resolution and calls for restricting gas sales to iran to prepare their people the iranian government decided this week to cut in half their gasoline subsidy for foreign supplies effectively eliminating almost 200 000 barrels a day from their pational supply this will trigger gasoline

the postal service has agreed to this bill in this bill there is a substantial reduction in the monopoly scope on first class mail right now first class mail and monopoly is whatever the postal service says it is under this bill there is a bright line determination it is six times the rate of the first class stamp which is a substantial giveback i also have to underscore the distinguished chairmans concerns about the suspension of title 18 you can argue about the needs for reform in pilot tests and such but maybe it was an inadvertent step but the fact still remains the amendment before the committee today will be a suspension of the criminal code which would empower rightly or wrongly those who would be entrusted with the mail of the united states postal service to be totally absolved under criminal responsibility now i can leave it to the imagination of the members what that could potentially mean for identity theft and on and on and on i doubt that the gentleman from arizona meant it but regardless that is what this reform calls for the last thing i would say is i think that a concern is about a new model for the postal service and i would agree and this bill understands that as well we specifically negotiated with the administration a study to be conducted under the auspices of gao they will hire a contract specialty firm that will look at establishing a future business model that in part and i will quote from the bill seeks to study the maintenance of the postal service in its current form as an independent establishment in the executive branch and two transforming the postal service into an ordinary corporation wholly owned by the government or wholly owned by private shareholders or partly by the government and partially by private shareholders this bill admits we have to take a careful look at the future of the business model of the postal service that is why this amendment should be rejected"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a couple of my
