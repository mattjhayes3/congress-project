it at that time there was a lot of rhetoric that we do not need a balancedbudget amendment what we need is a congress with the guts to balance the budget well ladies and gentlemen on wednesday of this week a bipartisan group of us will be offering this body as well as the other body a balanced budget for the first time in the history of this congress since we got onto these unbalanced budgets back in the late 1940s and early 1950s we are doing so without touching the social security trust funds we are doing so without touching the earned veterans benefits which are a contractual agreement to the people that have served in our armed services i hope you will all pay attention to it it is a budget that is fiscally responsible it will lower the interest rate debt service by 80 billion over that 5year period i would invite all of you to cosponsor that substitute balanced budget which i will be offering in the committee on rules on tuesday"]]}
