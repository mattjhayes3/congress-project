committee makes in order three amendments submitted to the rules committee which were germane to the legislation and provides for a motion to recommit in addition the resolution provides a closed rule for consideration of h r 511 the tribal labor sovereignty act of 2015 the rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the education and workforce committee and provides for a motion to recommit in addition the rule facilitates a conference with the senate on reauthorization of the elementary and secondary education act by replacing the text of s 1177 with the text of h r 5 as passed by the house and provides for a motion by the chair of the committee on education and the workforce to request a conference with the senate finally the rule directs the clerk to strike a provision from the reconciliation bill which was already enacted into law in the bipartisan budget act of 2015 facilitating consideration of the bill by the senate h r 1737 passed out of the financial services committee by a vote of 4710 it nullifies a guidance put forward by the consumer financial protection bureau which the cfpb was specifically exempted from making in the first place in addition to the cfpbs disregard for its statutory limitation the cfpbs methodology is severely flawed according to a study by charles river associates the cfpbs methodology overestimates minorities by up to 41 percent leading many to question the reliability of these results in addition and more importantly to me the rule provides for consideration of h r 511 the tribal labor sovereignty act of 2015 when congress passed the national labor relations act in 1935 it specifically recognized all governments were excluded subsequent regulations and case law further recognized this exemption applies to territories possessions the district of columbia and stateoperated port authorities from the 1970s until 2004 the nlrb recognized that tribal governments are exempt from the nlra as sovereign governments unfortunately in 2004 the nlrb decided to reverse 69 years of prior precedent and strip tribes of their ability of selfgovernment in our first terms in congress chairman kline and i both worked to try and restore the sovereignty this board had stripped away while unsuccessful at that time i am happy we are now able to rectify this injustice h r 511 the tribal labor sovereignty act would unequivocally state that tribal governments are not subject to the national labor relations act i respect my friends who hold different opinions but in this case they are simply wrong in the nlrbs 2004 decision they made an arbitrary distinction between commercial activity and government activity if you are a tribe and it is commercial activity they said the nlrb could regulate it but that same standard isnt applied to any other government exempted from the nlra regardless of whether it engages in commercial activities or not their nature as a government precludes their regulation under the nlra practically every county and city in this country has a golf course most states have a lottery the national park service operates hotels virginia and other states sell alcohol many cities operate convention centers all of these activities are not regulated under the nlra it should be the same with tribes in addition i am pleased that this rule

iraqi city of mosul there was an eerie silence one morning for the first time in two millennia the church bells didnt ring mosul is one of those diverse cities in the middle east it had a rich tapestry a vibrancy of various faith traditions christians yazidis muslims there were differences of religious perspectives sometimes tension but they found a way to continue to contribute an interdependency toward the wellbeing of that community they were invaded by eighth century barbarians with 21st century weaponry isis the christians who were there were told to leave convert or die by the sword many fled with just what was on their back the remaining christians in the homes had this painted on their door this is the arabic symbol for the letter n it stands for nazarene which is a derogatory term used by some in the middle east to describe the christians this was painted on their door as a sign that it was time for them to go or they would die except it wasnt painted in nice gold like this it was painted blood red we have so many tragedies and difficulties facing humanity we can sometimes become numb to the violence that is happening in so many places in the world because it is overwhelming but when you have one group of people who has extreme disregard for that sacred space of humanity for that sacred space of conscience and individual rights that are expressed in religious freedom you not only have a threat to a group of people far away but you have a threat to the underpinnings of civilization itself i happened to be in the room when pope francis was given a small christian cross a crucifix this cross had belonged to a young syrian man he had been captured by the jihadists he was told convert or die so he chose he chose his ancient faith tradition he chose christ he was beheaded his mother was somehow able to recover his body and this cross and bury him she fled and came to austria through this means the small cross came into the possession of the holy father this is not an isolated story it has happened over and over and over again as persons who were denied their life or denied the very conditions for life and they had to flee this is called

labeled this a genocide pope francis has said so presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle have said so now the house of representatives has declared it so as well i live in lincoln nebraska and i am privileged to represent the largest yazidi community in america it is not a community that i have gotten to know just recently because of all the difficulties that they have had we have worked with them for many many years many of these yazidi families were translators for the united states army during the height of the iraq war because of that this body by law gave them special citizenship options to live here in america and many settled in lincoln nebraska about a year and a half ago a number of young men in the yazidi community came to see me they were on the verge of

have the capacity to stop them help us you are the only ones who can help us please do something there is no more time the yazidi community also took its case to washington around the same time a resolution that was led by my good friend congressman vargas who will speak momentarily and passed by us in the house of representatives which called for international humanitarian assistance in northern iraq for the besieged people laid some of the groundwork which was a very prudential decisionand i commend president obama for itto stopping what was certain to be a slaughter on mount sinjar saving the remnants of the yazidi people who were still there so today we as a body are calling upon the international community as well as the fullness of our own government to act and to call this genocide this is one of those yazidi translators his name is omar again he gained his citizenship because he was so sacrificially helpful to us during the height of the iraq war he has lost 36 family

man that does not share the christian traditionto put a makeshift cross over the site where the christians previously lived why is this genocide designation important it is just to omar and his family it is just to the christians who died or had to flee it is just to the other people who are under severe persecution by the way i should note that the people who have been killed the most by isil are innocent muslims the genocide declaration though declares that there is a systematic attempt to exterminate this ancient faith tradition of the christians yazidis and others what it means is we are

there what was happening in darfur to be a genocide in doing so it helped put an end to that grim reality so today the house has spoken and i am proud that we have done so in a transpartisan manner with unanimity what i hope this does is again elevate international consciousness calling upon the responsible communities of the world to seek out constructive creative ways to help stop the violence

proud to stand with the gentleman from pennsylvania in support of this strong bipartisan bill he has truly championed the first major mental health reform in this country in 50 years right now our healthcare system does not allow families of those suffering from mental illness to become partners in their health care and this bill ensures that adult patients struggling with mental illness will receive the healthcare treatment they need while allowing their families to become close partners in their care it expands the mental health workforce and increases the number of psychiatric hospital beds for those experiencing an acute mental health crisis this legislation is a significant important step toward comprehensive communitybased care that will work better for people and most

miles of the border and it was great to see how the san diego sector and tucson and my fellow texans in mcallen are doing the same thing as the gentlewoman knows i spent 9 years as an undercover officer in the cia i chased groups like al qaeda and the taliban i have chased narcotraffickers all over the world and the threat is increasing and the threat is sophisticated the drug trafficking organizations in mexico are making 50 billion a year in the united states that is a big number their tactics techniques and procedures are sophisticated and we need to keep up it is about moves and countermoves what i like about this bill is it empowers our members of border patrol to do their job a lot of people talk about border security i like to refine it a little bit part of it is interdiction stopping people before they get to the border it is grabbing them it is having them in custody and then it is removal this bill is focused on this first piece of border security which is interdiction we need to make sure that our men and women that are on the border every single day have the tools that they need in order to do their job it is different in tucson it is different in eagle pass it is different in san diego what i like about this bill that was developed under the leadership of chairman mccaul is that it gives them that freedom and flexibility having spent a lot of time overseas i know the disconnect between the field and headquarters and that is going on right here on our border we need to make sure that the guys and gals that are on the border have the tools
