insurance coverage could be fined 2 000 per employee per year and the obama administration will force catholics to buy insurance coverage that includes coverage for services that many of them find morally wrong for many catholics this requirement violates their core beliefs about the sanctity of life of the unborn the health care law that is forcing catholics to put their government ahead of their god includes a religious conscience exemption it allows people with certain religious objections to opt out and some religious groups have been allowed to opt out but catholics have been denied an optout instead the obama administration is forcing catholics to violate their religious conscience this is not the united states of america that i know religious tolerance has been a bedrock principle of the american government for almost 240 years its one of the reasons why the united states came to exist in the first place the first amendment states that americans have the right to religious freedom religious freedom isnt just the ability to believe and worship as we see fit its also our right to keep other beliefs from being imposed on us the federal government has respected those rights by being sensitive by creating tolerant policies regarding our military service our tax policies and even our airport screenings american catholics are not asking for special rights were asking for equal rights i am proudly prolife and i will stand here to defend the rights of the unborn but this isnt about abortion this isnt a question of when life begins this is about the fundamental rights of all americans as spelled out in our founding documents and this decision by the obama administration is a devastating blow against the freedom of religion its one thing for the federal government to try to take over our health care system and we can all debate the merits of such legislation but i think we can all agree no matter on what side of the aisle we stand that the right to freely express our religious beliefsand more importantly not have other beliefs forced upon usis a core value of this country it is nonnegotiable good people of all faiths should be outraged

thereof theyre first and theyre first for a reason the united states of america has long been a place of religious freedom its one of the things that separates us from foreign countries just as the federal government should not endorse a religion it should not punish a religion either all religions must be treated equally they must be respected thats the american way today catholics all across

payroll taxes go up for at least a year the house bill does that if you want your payroll taxes to go up in 2 months then you would support the senate bill we are sending this bill back to conference

bill doesnt do those things so were obviously sending this bill back to conference the house bill also gives states the flexibility to require unemployment beneficiaries to submit to drug testing

you would support the house bill if you want your payroll tax to go up in 2 months then youd support the senate bill this is not a complicated debate this is very straightforward we in the house want

ignoring one of the most basic of american valuesthe freedom of religion im referring to the decision by the obama administration to force catholic employers to provide insurance that includes coverage for sterilization abortioninducing drugs and contraception catholic employers who fail to provide that insurance coverage could be fined 2 000 per employee per year and the obama administration will force catholics to buy insurance coverage that includes coverage for services that many of them find morally wrong for many catholics this requirement violates their core beliefs about the sanctity of life of the unborn the health care law that is forcing catholics to put their government ahead of their god includes a religious conscience exemption it allows people with certain religious objections to opt out and some religious groups have been allowed to opt out but catholics have been denied an optout instead the obama administration is forcing catholics to violate their religious conscience this is not the united states of america that i know religious tolerance has been a bedrock principle of the american government for almost 240 years its one of the reasons why the united states came to exist in the first place the first amendment states that americans have the right to religious freedom religious freedom isnt just the ability to believe and worship as we see fit its also our right to keep other beliefs from being imposed on us the federal government has respected those rights by being sensitive by creating tolerant policies regarding our military service our tax policies and even our airport screenings american catholics are not asking for special rights were asking for equal rights i am proudly prolife and i will stand here to defend the rights of the unborn but this isnt about abortion this isnt a question of when life begins this is about the fundamental rights of all americans as spelled out in our founding documents and this decision by the obama administration is a devastating blow against the freedom of religion its one thing for the federal government to try to take over our health care system and we can all debate the merits of such legislation but i think we can all agree no matter on what side of the aisle we stand that the right to freely express our religious beliefsand more importantly not have other beliefs forced upon usis a core value of this country it is nonnegotiable good people of all faiths should be outraged by this decision if this administration can trample on the beliefs and rights of the american catholics those of other religions should ask are we next yesterday i read in the new york times that legal scholars say the american constitution is old and outdated that it isnt relevant in the modern world now as this administration ignores our most treasured valuesnot religious values but american valuesour constitution could not be more relevant the first words of the american bill of rights are congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof theyre first and theyre first for a reason the united states of america has long been a place of religious freedom its one of the things that separates us from foreign countries just as the federal government should not endorse a religion it should not punish a religion either all religions must be treated equally they must be respected thats the american way today catholics all across the united states feel like outsiders they feel as if their government has betrayed them catholic leaders including three bishops that lead catholics in my district have clearly said they cannot and will not comply with this unjust decision by the obama administration no one should have to choose between their god and their government and no one especially a government founded on religious freedom should force them to the decision by this administration to make catholics violate their most basic principles is a violation of the most basic american principle i strongly condemn the obama administration for this outrageous overreach of federal authority and i strongly encourage

40 have been killed by the trainees and when you factor in the coalition troops trying to train the afghans 70 have been killed including the 40 americans we need to continue this process of remembering those who have given so much to our country because too many times we get so wrapped up with major issues like the debt the deficit and jobs and so many important things but there is nothing more important than those young men and women over there in afghanistan who are giving their limbs and their life i went to walter reed about 3 weeks ago and saw three marines from my district
