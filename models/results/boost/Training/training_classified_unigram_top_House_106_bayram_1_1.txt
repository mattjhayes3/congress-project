treasures of the 2nd congressional district historically the great state of california is most often associated with the gold rush northern california was the main destination of those in search of quick wealth the banks of the feather river yielded great riches to those who were in the right place at the right time but the precious metal that caused a rush to the west was not the only treasure that california possessed young settlers whose dreams had not materialized in the gold fields soon turned to the fertile central valley and envisioned golden acres of grain today those acres are covered with fruit trees rice fields and almond and walnut orchards as the valley continues to yield its agricultural treasure making california the leading agricultural economy in the world others looked at the golden promise in the vast forests their labor provided the lumber for the growing towns and cities of northern california a tremendous renewable resource to the american people our forests provide materials for homes and businesses as well as endless recreational opportunities and habitat for unique plant and animal species some entrepreneurs recognized that there were other ways to gather gold than simply panning in a streambed they opened dry goods stores banks and hotels women found that they could earn a living utilizing their household skills cooking and cleaning for miners who couldnt california was born a land of golden opportunities and to this day she continues to call to those willing to take a risk in order to improve their own lives many came to california for only a visit but stayed a lifetime the specious skies majestic mountains and rushing rivers of northern california stirred their souls while her fertile valleys gentle climate and endless opportunities captured their imagination yes gold fever may have lured early settlers here but even though the stores of that precious metal have mostly given out people still flock to california today as a third generation northern californian i am very proud of the beauty and resources of my native land i am proud to celebrate the 150 years that this jewel has been an important part of our

troops invaded south korea pouring across the 38th parallel and precipitating the korean war unprepared south korean or rok forces and the handful of americans on the ground were incapable of halting this swift and brutal assault in a matter of days the badly battered unitedstates and rok units had been pushed back to a tiny toehold on the southern tip of the korean peninsula it was only with determination and unbelievable courage that american forces together with south korean and allied troops were able to push back the attacking north korean army the breakout of the pusan perimeter the inchon landing battles like pork chop hill and heartbreak ridge the terrible fight against overwhelming odds at the frozen chosin reservoir on these and countless other unnamed battlefields we beat back the invaders the korean conflict reflected the absolute determination of the united states to halt the spread of tyranny and totalitarianism but the cost was high the war that north korea started resulted in 39 000 unitedstates deaths and over 100 000 wounded and severely undermined unitedstates relations with russia and china it took decades for our south korean ally to recover in the socalled democratic peoples republic of korea the dprk there is certainly a very different and distorted interpretation of the events that occurred 50 years ago incredibly according to the north korean news agency quote the unitedstates instigated the rok army to start a surprise armed invasion of north korea on june 25 1950 it was commanded by the unitedstates military advisory group end of quote the newscast goes on to explain that in precipitating this unprovoked attack the unitedstates supposedly indiscriminately carpet bombed throughout north korea these lies from north korea newscasts are not from some ancient historical record no this was the broadcast in the last several weeks it is worth noting that this slanderous pack of lies was broadcast right after the recent historic meeting between south korean president kim dae jung and north korean leader kim jong il it was broadcast the day after the united states had announced the delivery to north korea of an additional 50 000 tons of grain and about the same time that north korea was reinventing history secretary of state albright was announcing that north korea is not a terrorist state or even a rogue state but merely a state of concern this member points this out because of the recent changes in perception regarding north korea on the verge of collapse the hermit kingdom is at least attempting to give the impression that it is reaching out to south korea and to the west if north korea is in fact sincere in its peaceful overtures that certainly would be a dramatic positive development however it would be premature to assume that the dprk has irrevocably reformed its behavior it would be naive in the extreme to believe that a few gestures constitute a reversion of 50 years of violently confrontational behavior and terrorism and it would be foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary he must continue to view north korea as a terrorist state and to regard the korean peninsula as the place on the globe where american forces might again be attacked and a tragically costly war begun

would request that we have a clean rule in other words a rule that is limited to patient protection legislation and does not involve tax matters for which one could then get into discussions about offsets and other difficult problems well humor sometimes shows that the public is aware of a problem i remember a few years ago my wife and i went to the movie as good as it gets many people saw this movie it featured helen hunt and mr nicholson it was about a waitress played by helen hunt she had a young son who had asthma in one of the lines of the movie which i cannot repeat here on the floor helen hunt with expletive waste language described her hmo as preventing her son who had asthma from getting the type of care that he needed the forcefulness of her statement caused audiences not just to laugh but in many instances to stand up and clap and cheer as occurred in the movie theater that my wife and i attended this movie indicating that the public understands that there is a problem in the delivery of health care by hmos it is not so funny when we look at real life cases we have headlines and this probably is directly related to the humor or at least the understanding of the statement by helen hunt in the movie as good as it gets we have a headline here from the new york post hmos cruel rules leave her dying for the doc she needs just like the hmos cruel rules would not allow helen hunts son in the movie to get the asthma care that he needed so he was also ending up in the emergency room how about this headline from the new york post what his parents did not know about hmos may have killed this baby which brings us to an issue in hmo reform that we have been working on which deals with an issue that started this debate several years ago now before i came to congress i was a reconstructive surgeon in des moines iowa i still go overseas and do charitable surgery so i am still involved with the practice of medicine in some respects but a few years ago it became known that hmos were writing contracts in which they said that before a physician could tell a patient all of their treatment options they would first have to get an okay from the hmo these are called gag rules that then spawned a number of cartoons here we have one and i will read this for my colleagues because it is hard to see we have a physician sitting at his desk and he says your best option is cremation 359 fully insured the patient is sitting there saying this is one of those hmo gag rules isnt it doctor or how about this one the physician is sitting talking to his patient the physician says i will have to check my contract before i answer that question now think of that now say one is a woman one has a lump in ones breast and one goes in to see ones doctor he takes ones history does ones physical exam then he says excuse me i have to leave the room he goes out in the hallway he has to get on the phone phone the hmo and says mrs soandso has a lump in her breast she has three treatment options one of which may be expensive is it okay if i tell her about all three treatment options is that bizarre is that ridiculous does that strike at the heart of a patient having confidence that his physician is going to tell him all of his treatment options well it was not such a funny story for a real life patient this woman in the middle of this picture is dead today because her hmo prevented her from knowing all of her treatment options this story is fully documented in time magazine from about 2 years ago or how about the problem that one has had withhmos in delivering emergency care frequently hmos if one has gone to an emergency room will deny payment let me give my colleagues an example you wake up in the middle of the night you have crushing chest pain you are sweaty you know that the american heart association says this could be a sign that you are having a heart attack so you go to the emergency room right away like you should because if you delay you may be dead you have the tests run and the electrocardiogram shows it is normal but instead you have severe inflammation of your stomach or your esophagus so the hmo ex post facto says see the ekg was normal you were not having a heart attack you are stuck with the bill man because you did not need to go next time somebody thinks about that and then delays going to the emergency room when they should under what a common layperson would say is truly an emergency they may not get a second chance so here you have a cartoon that sort of deals with this you have a medical reviewer saying cuddly care hmo my name is joan how may i help you you are at the emergency room and your husband needs approval for treatment he is gasping writhing eyes rolled back in his head does not sound all that serious to me the medical reviewer at the hmo says then she says clutching his throat turning purple uhhuh have you tried an inhaler he is dead well then he certainly does not need treatment does he then the medical reviewer from the hmo turns to us and says gee people are always trying to rip us off that is black humor that is black humor i will tell my colleagues but that rings a bell with a lot of people who have trouble with their hmos here you have a picture from a tv show a long time ago you have a nurse here she is on the phone and she is saying chest pains let me find the emergency room preapproval forms how about a real life example of an hmo patient having significant problems with their hmo during an emergency this young woman who is strapped to a board was hiking not too far from washington she fell off a 40foot cliff she was lying at the base of the cliff semicomatose with a fractured skull a broken arm and a broken pelvis fortunately her boyfriend had a cellular phone and they got her airlifted into an emergency room she was in the icu on morphine drip for a long time but she is doing okay now but then she got a refusal of payment from her hmo they would not pay for her hospitalization do my colleagues know why they said well she did not phone ahead for preauthorization i mean think of that she was supposed to know that she was going to fall off the cliff break her skull break her arm fracture her pelvis maybe her hmo thought that as she was laying at the bottom of the cliff she should wake up with her nonbroken arm pull a cellular phone out dial a 1800 number and say hello i just fell off a cliff i broke my pelvis i need to go to the emergency room and then when she was in the hospital on a morphine drip in the icu after it became silly when the hmo was confronted with their denial they said well she was in the hospital and she did not notify us in the first couple of days so now we are not going to pay for it on that reason well she was finally able to get some help from her state ombudsman but many people who have health insurance particularly through their employers would not have that option so what we have in the bill that we are talking about the patient protection bill the bipartisan consensus managedcare reform bill is a provision that says look if an average person has what they would say truly is an emergency they get to go to the emergency room and the hmo has to pay how about some of these plan guidelines the hmos use to determine medical necessity remember these remember when the hmos were talking about drivethrough delivery of babies or mandating only 24hour stays in the hospital boy they were embarrassed by that but under federal law they can define medical necessity anyway they want to and even if a patient suffers an jury they have no recourse under federal law here we have a cartoon with dr welby and he is saying she had her baby 45 minutes ago discharge her i mean imagine that line on that program years ago people would have thought that was absolutely crazy and yet that is what the hmos have mandated in some cases here we have a cartoon that says maternity hospital and then we have the drivethrough window with the caption now only 6minute stays for new moms and the person at the window says congratulations would you like fries with that and look at the mother her hair is all out like this the baby is crying and then there is a little thing that says looking a little like scalding coffee situation in the corner now this may be a little bit funny but it was not funny to a woman by the name of florence corcoran whose baby was sent home within the mandated 24 hours the baby ended up dying of an infection that would have been discoveredhad the baby been allowed to stay in the hospital just a little bit longer i was talking a little bit about the hmos ability under federal law for employer plans to define medical necessity any way they want to well i have taken care of a lot of children with this birth defect a cleft lip and a cleft palate there are some hmos out there that are defining medical necessity as the cheapest least expensive care think of that for a minute they can deny any treatment that is not the cheapest least expensive care so for this child with this birth defect instead of authorizing a surgical correction of the roof of this childs mouth that would enable the child to be able to learn to speak correctly not to mention not having food go out of his nose that hmo under federal law as it currently exists could say no that is not the cheapest care we are going to prescribe a little piece of plastic to shove up in that hole in the roof of the mouth what is called an obturator of course will the child be able to learn to speak properly with that no but quality does not matter to the hmos when they are defining care as the cheapest least expensive care and under federal law they could do that with impunity we need to fix that here we have another cartoon we have the operating table we have the doctors the hmo bean counters and anesthesiologist at the head of the table and the doctor says scalpel the hmo bean counter says pocketknife the doctor says suture the hmo bean counter says bandaid the doctor says let us get him to intensive care and the hmo bean counter says call a cab they can do that under current federal law because they can define medical necessity as the cheapest least expensive care here is a cartoon that says remember the old days when we took refresher courses in medical procedures one doctor is saying to a colleague as they walk in the hmo medical school and the course directory in the hmo medical school is first floor basic bookkeepingand accounting second floor advanced bookkeeping and accounting third floor graduate bookkeeping and accounting now look i think some hmos do a reasonable job and they should be a choice for people to have and some hmos are truly trying to do an ethical job as well but the hmo field is very competitive particularly on prices and there are some bad apples out there that are cutting corners too close and they are able to do that because this federal law that i was talking about that passed 25 years ago put nothing in place of state insurance oversight it took the oversight on quality away from the states not a very republican idea it took it away from the states put it in the federal arena but then placed nothing in its place in terms of some standard rules on fairness to patients or on quality here we have another cartoon that says the hmo bedside manner time is money is the sign on the edge of the bed bed space is loss turnover is profit and the health care provider is saying after consulting my colleague in accounting we have concluded youre well enough now go home and here we have a patient with his arms in traction looking like he has a fractured face with his jaw in traction the bottom line should not be the bottom line if it is going to interfere with quality health care here we have another cartoon where the patient is saying to the hmo physician do you make more money if you give patients less care the hmo spokesperson says thats absurd crazy delusional the patient then says are you saying im paranoid and the answer is yes but we can treat it in three visits it reminds me of the wellknown joke about the three physicians who died and went to heaven one of them was a neurosurgeon and he said to saint peter you know i fixed people who were in accidents and had blood clots on their brains and i saved their lives and saint peter said enter myr son the next person is an obstdtician and she says to saint peter a have delivered hundreds of thousands of babies and i have given a lot of free care and saint peter says enter my daughter and the last one is an hmo medical director who says well saint peter i was able to save millions of dollars by denying care and getting people out of the hospital earlier and saint peter says enter my son for 3 days here we have a cartoon that is the hmo claims department and the hmo bureaucrat says no we dont authorize that specialist then she says no we dont cover that operation and then she says no we dont pay for that medication and then apparently there is some strong language or something as she is listening and then she looks rather cross and says no we dont consider this assisted suicide now look if all of this seems a little off the wall let me just say that it has reallife consequences when hmos are not accountable for their medical decisions and is there anyone that doubts that hmos are making medical decisions every day not by the hundreds not by the thousands but by the tens of thousands every day they are making medical decisions and under federal law they are not liable for the bad results the negligent results of those decisions that could result in loss of life or limb now if an insurance company sells a policy as an individual and they are under state insurance oversight that insurance company does not have that kind of legal liability shield but under this antiquated federal law it is the only group in this country other than foreign diplomats that have legal immunity for the decisions that they are making the automobile manufacturers do not have that kind of legal immunity the airplane manufacturers or the airlines do not only the group that provides health care for employers is totally immune from the consequences or responsibility of their decisions so let me tell my colleagues about a case where this makes a real difference where an hmo made a medical decision i have here a picture of a little boy who is tugging his sisters sleeve he is about 6 months old a few weeks after this picture was taken he is awake at about 3 in the morning with a temperature of about 105 and he is sick and as a mother can tell he is really sick and he needs to go to the emergency room so mom does what she should do she phones that 1800 number for that hmo and says my baby jimmy is sick he has a temperature of 104 105 and he needs to go to the emergency room and this voice from some distant place certainly not familiar with her state says well all right i will authorize you to take little jimmy to this hospital and mom says well where is it and the reply from the medical bureaucrat is well i dont know find a map well it turns out that it is a long ways away but mom and dad know that if they take little jimmy to a different hospital then their hmo is not going to cover any of the cost so they wrap up little jimmy and start the trek halfway through the trip they pass three emergency rooms with pediatric care facilities that could have taken care of little jimmy but they cannot stop they are not medical professionals but they do know if they stop at those unauthorized hospitals they would be stuck with potentially a huge bill so they keep driving before they get to the hospital that has been designated little jimmy has a cardiac arrest and he stops breathing and his heart stops beating imagine that while mom and dad are driving mom is trying to keep this beautiful little boy alive they come screeching finally into the emergency room mom leaps out screaming help me help me help my baby a nurse runs out and does mouthtomouth resuscitation they start ivs they give him medicines they pound his chest and they get him back alive but because of that medical decision that that hmo made they do not get him back whole because of that circulatory arrest he ends up with gangrene of both hands and both feet and they have to be amputated here is little jimmy after his hmo treatment sans hands and sans feet under federal law the hmo which made this medically negligent decision is liable for nothing zero nada because they have already paid for his amputations and that is all they are liable for is that fairness is that justice this little boy will never play basketball i would remind the speaker of the house that this little boy will never wrestle i would remind my colleagues that some day when he grows up and he gets married he will never be able to caress the cheek of the woman that he loves with his hand i would remind the hmo people who always say do not legislate on the basis of anecdotes like little jimmy adams that this little boy if he had a hand and you pricked his finger it would bleed we need justice i am a republican i have stood on this floor and i have voted for responsibility for ones ac1 tions if a murderer or a rapist is convicted they should suffer the con sequences when we passed the welfare reform bill we said it is your responsibility if you are ablebodied and you could work it is your responsibility to get some education we will help you with that but you need to get out and get a job and support your family republicans are big on responsibility but look are my fellow republicans going to say to the hmos when they are responsible for a little boy losing his hands and feet that that hmo should not be responsible and furthermore we republicans have said you know what we should devolve power back to the states let us get these things back to the states this was a federal law that took this oversight away from the states in the name of justice we should say that if an hmo makes this type of decision that results in this type of injury they should be responsible for that that is only fair i will tell my colleagues what those bottomline hmos that are cutting the corners too close will be much more careful so we will not see injuries like this a judge reviewed this case the judge in reviewing the hmos decision making on this said that their margin of safety was razor thin i would add to that as razor thin as the scalpel that had to cut off little jimmys hands and feet what we are talking about next week when we have this debate is an issue that has a lot of importance to people every day around the country we will have an opportunity to correct a wrong to right a wrong the bill as it was written in erisa 25 years ago did not anticipate the changes that we have seen in the management of health care by hmos where they are now managing medical decisions i am a physician i would never argue that if i had made a negligent decision that had resulted in an injury like this that i as a physician should be immune from the consequences i do not know any physicians who would make that argument i do not know an airplane manufacturer that if it is negligent and a plane goes down and 200 people are killed would make an argument on this floor that anyone would vote for that would give them legal immunity for their negligent actions i just do not see it well we are going to have an opportunity to debate several bills next week there is a difference in those bills there is a bill that my good friends the gentleman from oklahoma"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "well i would like to approach it in a different way and i think a consensus has been built on the floor of this house from everyone i have heard no one stand up and say that this is something that should not be done i have heard the gentleman from california and the gentleman from california obviously has not read the legislation because he says that it will go to monsters in countries who abuse human rights in the legislation it restricts money for those countries so i would simply say to you when you speak on this legislation have some understanding of it do not claim that we need things in the legislation which are already there and have been since the beginning of this legislation but despite that let me simply say this a consensus is building here tonight and whether it is on the floor of this house tonight or it is 2 weeks from tonight if everyone has spoken the truth on the floor of this house tonight with some exception some are not supporting debt relief some do not believe that it is a good idea and i applaud their honesty i applaud their honesty to say 1 20 is to6 much to h5930 co spend to save 40 000 people a day if my colleagues believe that say it and we will have a vote but sometime before we go home this year we should fund this if we believe that we should do something about 40 000 people a day that we could save a number of those people no one that has looked at this issue believes that it will not help there is no one that has looked at this issue that has said it is not the first step if we are not concerned enough for children half the children in these countries who never go to school not attend one day in school if we are not concerned that children in these countries are not vaccinated a 50 cent shot and as a result they are dying every day if 1 20 a year is too much then vote against debt relief but i would say that the majority of this body recognizes that it is not only in their interest it is in our interest it is in our best interest if my colleagues have looked at this if they have looked at this issue far more than anything else they are convinced that this is in our national interest we have diseases that were thought to be extinct that are now spreading across the globe because of conditions in these countries they are reaching our shores they are killing our people we cannot turn our backs on these conditions without them spilling over our shores we spend 400 billion and 500 billion making the world safe through arms yet we turn our back on 1 billion for food for security and peace why can we not do as eisenhower did with the marshall plan why can we not give peace a chance do we have to change the world only through shipping arms around the world and if we do it and it is necessary is it necessary to the tune of 400 billion yet we cannot find a billion for this those are questions we will all have to answer"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "well here we are again with a difficult rule we will see whether we can work this out i think i need to spend a

controls the access and health costs of 60 percent of insured oregonians market competition in texas is all but gone twentyfour competing companies have compressed into four megamanaged care companies

275 mergers and acquisitions of health plans there are now seven managed health care plans and blues control the cost and access of the majority of people in this country what does that mean that means if one is a provider a doctor and that hmo controls 50 or 60 percent of their patients and they present a contract and say take it or leave it and that doctor has a child in college they are making mortgage payments how do they turn them down when they have a contract clause that says medical necessity means the shortest least expensive or least intense level of care as defined by us or maybe they say like this blue cross blue shield contract of iowa where the health plan shifts responsibility to physicians for the health plans breaches of confidentiality that they release any liability for disclosure made by the company or how about the gag clauses that companies want providers to sign on to a lot of providers just do not have a choice i have had a lot of republican

presentation with proposing a toast and perhaps we can raise our glasses to propose a toast to the health of the american people because that is what this special order is all about the health of the american people for a long time now many of us in the house have been about the business of trying to double over a period of 5 years the funding for the national institutes of health in doing so we are focusing directly on the reason for the toast that we made to start the proceedings namely preventive medicine for the health of the american people remedies for some of the maladies that afflict the american people and longterm strategies to bring about a world safer for our people and to rid the world eventually of all of our diseases that so ravage the livesof so many people so doubling the funding for the nih for the national institutes of health is a worthy goal and it accomplishes so many facets of goals for the american people and for the citizens of the world for that matter that sometimes we wonder why there is not more support than there sometimes is shown but last year last session we were successful those of us who participate in this endeavor in making the first downpayment on the doubling effort over a period of 5 years by succeeding in having our appropriators list 2 billion into the then budget the downpayment on the doubling we are now in the posture where we must do the same thing in order to maintain the momentum by bringing about increased funding for the nih for the current session in doing so we have introduced h res 89 i believe it is which asks our congress our house of representatives to consider doubling the funding for nih i submit for the record the copy of h res 89 which takes care of what we are after in the funding for the national institutes of health h res 89 whereas past investments in biomedical research have resulted in better health an improved quality of life for all americans and a reduction in national health care expenditures whereas the nations commitment to biomedical research has expanded the base of scientific knowledge about health and disease and revolutionized the practice of medicine whereas the federal government represents the single largest contributor to biomedical research conducted in the united states whereas biomedical research continues to play a vital role in the growth of this nations biotechnology medical device and pharmaceutical industries whereas the origin of many of the new drugs and medical devices currently in use is based on biomedical research supported by the national institutes of health whereas women have traditionally been underrepresented in medical research protocols yet are severely affected by diseases including breast cancer which will kill over 43 900 women this year ovarian cancer which will claim another 14 500 lives and osteoporosis and cardiovascular disorders whereas research sposored by the national institutes of health is responsible for the identification of genetic mutations relating to nearly 100 diseases including alzheimers disease cystic fibrosis huntingtons disease osteoporosis many forms of cancer and immune deficiency disorders whereas many americans still face serious and lifethreatening health problems both acute and chronic whereas neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly such as alzheimers and parkinsons disease threaten to destroy the lives of millions of americans overwhelm the nations health care system and bankrupt the medicare and medicaid programs whereas 4 000 000 americans are currently infected with the hepatitis c virus an insidious liver condition that can lead to inflammation cirrhosis and cancer as well as liver failure whereas 250 000 americans are now suffering from aids and hundreds of thousands more with hiv infection whereas cancer remains a comprehensive threat to any tissue or organ of the body at any age and remains a top cause of morbidity and mortality whereas the extent of psychiatric and neurological diseases poses considerable challenges in understanding the workings of the brain and nervous system whereas recent advances in the treatment of hiv illustrate the promise research holds for even more effective accessible and affordable treatments for persons with hiv whereas infants and children are the hope of our future yet they continue to be the most vulnerable and underserved members of our society whereas approximately one out of every six american men will develop prostate cancer and over 49 200 men will die from prostate cancer each iear whereas diabetes both insulin and noninsulin forms afflicts 15 700 000 americans and places them at risk for acute and chronic complications including blindness kidney failure atherosclerosis and nerve degeneration whereas the emerging understanding of the principles of biometrics has been applied to the development of hard tissue such as bone and teeth as well as soft tissue and this field of study holds great promise for the design of new classes of biomaterials pharmaceuticals and diagnostic and analytical reagents whereas research sponsored by the national institutes of health will map and sequence the entire human genome by 2005 leading to a new era of molecular medicine that will provide unprecedented opportunities for the prevention diagnosis treatment and cure of diseases that currently plague society whereas the fundamental way science is conducted is changing at a revolutionary pace demanding a far greater investment in emerging new technologies and research training

democracy the nld during this period and indeed since 1962 when general ne win and the military seized control the burmese military has engaged in egregious systematic violence and abuse of the fundamental human rights of ethnic minorities and other people of the country the abuses of the junta in rangoon again came under international scrutiny when on august 24 of this year aung san suu kyi was denied the ability to visit nld party offices outside the capital for 9 days she was detained at a roadblock and eventually was forcibly removed to her residence she and other nld party leaders were placed under virtual house arrest despite the militarys denials no independent observer was allowed to visit her and the british ambassador for example was roughed up when he attempted to force his way into her compound in addition party offices were ransacked and papers seized to justify their action the junta has issued the ludicrous charge that the nld had formed an alliance with rebels in the provinces on september 21 the day the committee passed this measure aung san suu kyi was again blocked from traveling outside rangoon by the military regime she planned to travel by train to mandalay in order to visit with nld party members officials at the rangoons central train station insisting that there were no train tickets available refused to sell tickets to her and her accompanying party eventually after hours of stalemate police removed her from the train station and forced her to return home since her september 21 attempt to travel to mandalay aung san suu kyi and

general khin nyunt despite his mandate to promote human rights and restore democracy in burma ambassador razali has yet to meet with aung san suu kyi or any other nld party leaders this is razalis second visit to burma as the u n secretary generals special envoy clearly not meeting with aung san suu kyi or any other nld leaders brings the u n s credibility into question it is entirely proper therefore that the house of representatives go on record condemning these human rights abuses since her electoral victory in 1990 daw aung san suu kyi has repeatedly been arrested threatened and harassed the illegal sdpc military regime has done everything possible to discredit nld and its leaders this is simply wrong and this body should say so at the subcommittee markup an amendment was approved that had the concurrence of the resolutions distinguished author the gentleman from illinois and whichwas designed to update the situation in burma the amendment updated the current standoff between aung san suu kyi and the military by including six new whereas clauses these clauses detailed the denial of right to movement and association and the seizure of documents at nld party offices

certainly a very different and distorted interpretation of the events that occurred 50 years ago incredibly according to the north korean news agency quote the unitedstates instigated the rok army to start a surprise armed invasion of north korea on june 25 1950 it was commanded by the unitedstates military advisory group end of quote the newscast goes on to explain that in precipitating this unprovoked attack the unitedstates supposedly indiscriminately carpet bombed throughout north korea these lies from north korea newscasts are not from some ancient historical record no this was the broadcast in the last several weeks it is worth noting that this slanderous pack of lies was broadcast right after the recent historic meeting between south korean president kim dae jung and north korean leader kim jong il it was broadcast the day after the united states had announced the delivery to north korea of an additional 50 000 tons of grain and about the same time that north korea was reinventing history secretary of state albright was announcing that north korea is not a terrorist state or even a rogue state but merely a state of concern this member points this out because of the recent changes in perception regarding north korea on the verge of collapse the hermit kingdom is at least attempting to give the impression that it is reaching out to south korea and to the west if north korea is in fact sincere in its peaceful overtures that certainly would be a dramatic positive development however it would be premature to assume that the dprk has irrevocably reformed its behavior it would be naive in the extreme to believe that a few gestures constitute a reversion of 50 years of violently confrontational behavior and terrorism and it would be foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary he must continue to view north korea as a terrorist state and to regard the korean peninsula as the place on the globe where american forces might again be attacked and a tragically costly war begun again"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a couple of years ago when ratings for television were

house thatfirst year i was here not only did we take social security money and spend it we took every cent of social security money and spent it not only did we take all of the social security

telling us our national security will suffer a fatal blow if we choose to give up air dominance in the next century in a letter to congress last week secretary of defense william cohen told us that canceling the f22 program means we cannot guarantee air superiority in future conflicts six former secretaries of defense have echoed secretary cohens words calling the f22a essential program that must be fully funded make no mistake about it if we cancelthe f22 we are making a decision to stake the lives of american soldiers on inferior equipment because some in congress think they know more about air warfare than the united states air force ironically canceling the f22 wont even accomplish its stated goal of saving money secretary cohen has told us the alternative to the f22 an upgraded f15 already over 25 years old will cost the same as the f22 but will not provide air dominance the secretary has also told uscorrectlythat not only will the joint strike fighter or jsf be unable to fill the air superiority role it will also be unable to handle its strike role without f22 support this is the legislative equivalent of rejecting a cadillac in order to buy a yugo for twice the price the jsf is not was never contemplated to be and cannot be made into the f22 it is not an airsuperiority fighter it is a subsonic tactical fighter that goes into a conflict after the f22 establishes air dominance the jsf cannot itself establish air dominance in september of 1939 neville chamberlain told the british people to go home and rest easy because he hadpurchased peace for our time the
