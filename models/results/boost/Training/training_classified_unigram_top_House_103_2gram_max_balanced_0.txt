congress should be able to reform the mining law without causing great harm to another domestic industry of vital interest to this nation and our competitiveness but congress is about to do it again about to pass legislation which overregulates a domestic industry and makes it virtually iapossible for it to stay in business if we continue to drive the ranching mining and timber industries off public lands there will be nothing left out there the people and communities will go away move to the cities and the consumers living in the cities will foot the bill by paying higher prices for these goods its too bad that some members of congress have not seen fit to draft responsible legislation on these lic lands issues dealing with the ranching mining and the timber industries some of us from the west have tried but our proposals never see the light of day on the house floor congresswoman vucanovia introduced a mining law reform bill which would not destroy this countrys competitiveness

the nation we should stop treating this industry as a blight and trying to destroy it the mining industry is important to this nation it provides benefits to the consumer workers and the surrounding communities madam chairman i rise in strong opposition to h r 322 as reported by the committee on natural resources this bill isan arrow aimed squarely at the heart of my constituents oh yes it will have plenty of impacts elsewherehero and abroadbut nevada miners are destined to pay the freight on h r 322 until all our mining capital has taken flight that is let me begin madam chairman with a brief rebuttal to charges we have heard and will hear some more no doubt yes the mining law is 121 years old and was signed by president ulysses s grant but the 42d congress just 2 months earlier passed the bill establishing the worlds first national parkyellowstone is this park and that concept antiquated too besides the act of may 10 1872 has been amended per se at least 35 times more importantly however it has been amended in effect each time congress or state legislatures enact environmental laws that is right despite the rhetoric of the antimining lobby the 1872 act does not immunize miners from one single environmental law we have heard some complaints about the details of h r 322 already i would like to put my general concerns in the context of the principles of the mining law important to us if we are to keep a domestic industry first is the concept of free access to the public domain and the selfinitiation of rights free acess does not mean without fee it means unfettered by bureaucratic redtape the unsuitability provisions of this bill contradict this concept in a big way i oppose letting unelected bureaucrats do the job of congress other principles completely thrashed in h r 322 are security of tenure and the associated right to mine under current law these concepts are absolutely fundamental to investment in mineral exploration and deyelopment worldwide h r 322 has nothing like the property right associated with unpatented mining claims today nor even the colitractual rights a leaseholder for coal has nothing ones investment is entirely at risk to the whims of congress and the secretary it would appear career officials at the justice department fully agreedkr 322 represents a diminishment of rights so severe as to be labeled a taking of a property interest of some magnitude those officials suggested a major retrenchment of h r 322 to escape this consequence but it is not in this substitute now i do not argue that the current right to mine is without qualification it certainly is limited by the ability to meet current environmental thresholds in law cant meet clean water act standards well you cant mine until you demonstrate compliance but the right is predicated upon meeting standards applicable to everyone how do todays miners gain secure tenure well one way is to seek fee title to lands what we call a patent some members complain bitterly this is a big giveaway but it has been grossly distorted all we hear is 32 50 per acre when the truth is that it costs a mining claimanttens of thousands of dollars on average to develop ones claim to this point these are dollars working in our economy only a portion of which are sent to washington thank goodness and say some people with amazement miners have patented an area the size of connecticut since 1872 let me put this in perspective here is a map of the western states sans alaska in which this law operates here is my state and district and here is a map of connecticut at the same scale can you see it twentytwo connecticuts would fit into my district alone what is the big problem are we concerned that at this pace the public do main may be privatized by the year 6000 or beyond another chart i have here puts the lie to the magnitude of lands disturbed by mining versus other uses mining is way down the list again what is the problem perhaps those members from states settled under the homestead act would like to explain the cost to patent those lands i recall it was free from a fee but we all know those pioneering people busted their backs proving up the homestead to land office satisfaction and so do miners now im going to give an example from my district about why patenting is critical secretary babbitt has been in the forefront of those calling for an end to patenting he made very public statements regarding a mine near elko nv which he described as containing 25 million ounces of gold reserves and he was darn mad that he would have to grant title to the property and lose the opportunity to levy a royalty everyone agrees its a worldclass mine he told me in committee testimony that he was bbliged to follow the law and issue patents until the law is changed i took him at his word but where is the patent well it now seems secretary babbitt has concerns that endangered species consultation is necessary because a stream 7 miles away and outside the watershed of the mine i believe may have a fish in it needing protection his own professionals at blm have told him no hydrologic connection exists but he persists bottom line madam chairman if this gold mine probably the richest in america cannot satisfy the secretarys requirements for proving a valuable deposit exists probably no mine can is this the way we want the secretary of the interior to use the endangered species act as leverage over patent applicants to somehow make them obliged to pay a royalty that they otherwise would not i think not speaking of royalty let me reiterate my concerns this bill would send the united states on the opposite course most other nations are taking mexico dropped its 7 percent gross royalty over a year ago and is now satisfied with taxing miners profits as are canada south africa and gold mines in western australia the world bank advises developing nations to forgo gross royalties to lure mineral investments that pay many times over in their economic benefits yet secretary babbitt and the sponsors of this bill still insist upon a gross royalty formula they keep saying thats what coal and oil and gas pay but so what we all know coal royalties are paid by electricity consumers every month in their light bills and oil and gas it is valued at the wellhead before any cost other than pumping is added i would like to see the same scheme applied to hardrock mines value the broken ore at the minemouth after all it may be publicly owned minerals but its private labor that wins the metal from the ore why should uncle sam receive a cut off the top on these postmining costs he would under h r 322 despite the net in net smelter return it is indeed a gross royalty in my view the federal government is entitled to a share of the profits just as it is with any other business and other nations agree with me this is the reality of todays global marketplace lets take a look at the impact the royalty alone in this bill would have this chart shows the results of various model studies run on the data i show only 8 percent gross royalty numbers here but other numbers were crunched let me call your attention to the first row these are the interior departments own figures the committee report acknowledges the net job loss associated with this royalty 1 100 jobs that is not an industry sponsored study its secretary babbitts royalty task force that said this and this is a net job loss they are counting abandoned mine reclamation jobs as well as new bureaucrat positions needed under this bill against the real job losses of miners geologists engineers haul truck drivers and the like believe me the doi numbers are cooked because the static analysis doesnt begin to account for the retreat from public lands that this ultrahigh royalty would cause of course studies that do recognize this real life principle show much more job loss and losses to the unitedstates treasury the bill would likely cause we proved with the 100 holding fee that the miners do have alternatives they drop their claims and go elsewhere omb estimated 97 million would be collected from the firsttime rental fee blm actually received only 51 million or so so much for executive branch scoring back to job losses i have here on the poster a quote from president clinton he made while speaking about nafta i believe he is sincere about not wanting to knowingly cause job losses but his guys down at interior are causing him to misspeak whatever your vote will be tomorrow on nafta i think we all agree that job lossor creationis the motivating factor well here we have a bill that indisputably causes job loss i think major losses but this body is prepared to pass it anyway we have got to get to conference with a tough position says the chairman because the senate bill is so weak i disagree strongly but more importantly why should the house vote to send good highpaying jobs to mexico unilaterally thats where our dollars are headed my friends and h r 322 will accelerate the trend greatly last madam chairman i would like to put a human touch to my remarks by telling you about elko nv the best small town in america elko is in the heart of gold mining country today more than onethird of its population is employed by the mining industry mining companies paid over 250 million in salaries and benefits to elko area employees in 1992 plus scholarships to young adults and donations for schools hospitals and the like mining is a good fit for this community whose residents i am proud to call my constituents they are hardworking people producers for this country we export much of elkos gold to help our nations balance of trade we should remember mining jobs pay the highest wages of all production workers averaging nearly 39 000 per year benefits as in health benefits so let me end by reflecting upon the candid statement of the sponsor of similar mining reform legislation in the other body senator bumpers actually said last july adios as far as im concerned why mine america first this extremely cavalier attitude shows he thinks his state will not be impacted by this bill but let me differ once more miners on nevada buy explosives chemicals trucks bulldozers and all sorts of other supplies and equipment from somewhere and usually its made out of state and we are talking mucho dinero as they say south of the border will the manufacturers be able to sell dozers to mexico at the same pace as to nevada i bet not so there will be an impact east of the mississippi madam

committee on which i serve marked up the unemployment compensation bill h r 920 which would add 5 7 billion to the deficit all of us can appreciate the hardships faced by the longterm unemployed however extending benefits to these individuals by adding to the deficit does not put these people back to work and actually hinders the creation of jobs by forcing the government to borrow more from the private sector indeed all we are doing 4s continuing to borrow from future generations to feed the insatiable spending appetite of this congress in addition recent reports show that the economy is improving during the last quarter of 1992 the economy grew 3 8 percent the highest level in 4 years this expansion lowered the national unemployment rate from 7 7 percent last june to the current level of 7 1 percent it is also worth noting that h r 920 would increase the deficit to provide extended unemployment compensation benefits to 17 states with unemployment rates less than 6 percent clearly if an unemployment emergency exists it is not nationwide as h r 920 suggests congress recognized these regional differences during its conslderatlon of last years extended unemployment

about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind of ethics rules of this house u 1520 by doing that we would not create a new bureaucracy costing millions of dollars to the american taxpayer and infringing on their rights to contact their

who has spoken here in support of this comes from somewhere else other than the states dedicated to public lands we have 50 percent in our state some go as high as 80 percent these are not parks these are not wilderness these are lands that were left after the homesteads took place these are not highproductive areas we are talking about multiple use here the opportunity to use multiply these lands that are in public ownershil the rest of your states the lands went to private ownership or went to the state i have a suggestion why do you not deed it to the states why do you not do that in a

the spirit of the republican party for all these 38 years bob michel is a great man the living embodiment of all that is best about the republican party there is one other term that comes to mind when i think of bob michel that word that phrase is semper fidelis another marine corps term it means always faithful i think back to the first 2 years of the ronald reagan presidency when bob michel put his heart and soul into passing the reagan program through congress he made tough votes that were difficult to make cutting back on entitlement programs doing things that we should have been doing all

the gentlewoman for yielding this time to me madam chairman the mining reform bill brought to the floor by congressman rahall is opposed because it will destroy thousands of jobs related to the mining industry congress has been grappling with the question of reforming the mining law for a number of years however the rahall approach would destroy an entire industr7 the jobs it generates the communities it sustains congress should be able to reform the mining law without causing great harm to another domestic industry of vital interest to this nation and our competitiveness but congress is about to do it again about to pass legislation which overregulates a domestic industry and makes it virtually iapossible for it to stay in business if we continue to drive the ranching mining and timber industries off public lands there will be nothing left out there the people and communities will go away move to the cities and the consumers living in the cities will foot the bill by paying higher prices for these goods its too bad that some members of congress have not seen fit to draft responsible legislation on these lic lands issues dealing with the ranching mining and the timber industries some of us from the west have tried but our proposals never see the light of day on the house floor congresswoman vucanovia introduced a mining law reform bill which would not destroy this countrys competitiveness and which promoted production increased revenues to the federal treasury and benefited the consumers that bill never had a chance hopefully the senate will be able to provide a more responsible and balanced approach in grant county nm the phelps dodge mining co has been operating for over 80 years and has made maor contributions to our states economy new mexico gained more

and the nation we should stop treating this industry as a blight and trying to destroy it the mining industry is important to this nation it provides benefits to the consumer workers and the surrounding communities madam chairman i rise in strong opposition to h r 322 as reported by the committee on natural resources this bill isan arrow aimed squarely at the heart of my constituents oh yes it will have plenty of impacts elsewherehero and abroadbut nevada miners are destined to pay the freight on h r 322 until all our mining capital has taken flight that is let me begin madam chairman with a brief rebuttal to charges we have heard and will hear some more no doubt yes the mining law is 121 years old and was signed by president ulysses s grant but the 42d congress just 2 months earlier passed the bill establishing the worlds first national parkyellowstone is this park and that concept antiquated too besides the act of may 10 1872 has been amended per se at least 35 times more importantly however it has been amended in effect each time congress or state legislatures enact environmental laws that is right despite the rhetoric of the antimining lobby the 1872 act does not immunize miners from one single environmental law we have heard some complaints about the details of h r 322 already i would like to put my general concerns in the context of the principles of the mining law important to us if we are to keep a domestic industry first is the concept of free access to the public domain and the selfinitiation of rights free acess does not mean without fee it means unfettered by bureaucratic redtape the unsuitability provisions of this bill contradict this concept in a big way i oppose letting unelected bureaucrats do the job of congress other principles completely thrashed in h r 322 are security of tenure and the associated right to mine under current law these concepts are absolutely fundamental to investment in mineral exploration and deyelopment worldwide h r 322 has nothing like the property right associated with unpatented mining claims today nor even the colitractual rights a leaseholder for coal has nothing ones investment is entirely at risk to the whims of congress and the secretary it would appear career officials at the justice department fully agreedkr 322 represents a diminishment of rights so severe as to be labeled a taking of a property interest of some magnitude those officials suggested a major retrenchment of h r 322 to escape this consequence but it is not in this substitute now i do not argue that the current right to mine is without qualification it certainly is limited by the ability to meet current environmental thresholds in law cant meet clean water act standards well you cant mine until you demonstrate compliance but the right is predicated upon meeting standards applicable to everyone how do todays miners gain secure tenure well one way is to seek fee title to lands what we call a patent some members complain bitterly this is a big giveaway but it has been grossly distorted all we hear is 32 50 per acre when the truth is that it costs a mining claimanttens of thousands of dollars on average to develop ones claim to this point these are dollars working in our economy only a portion of which are sent to washington thank goodness and say some people with amazement miners have patented an area the size of connecticut since 1872 let me put this in perspective here is a map of the western states sans alaska in which this law operates here is my state and district and here is a map of connecticut at the same scale can you see it twentytwo connecticuts would fit into my district alone what is the big problem are we concerned that at this pace the public do main may be privatized by the year 6000 or beyond another chart i have here puts the lie to the magnitude of lands disturbed by mining versus other uses mining is way down the list again what is the problem perhaps those members from states settled under the homestead act would like to explain the cost to patent those lands i recall it was free from a fee but we all know those pioneering people busted their backs proving up the homestead to land office satisfaction and so do miners now im going to give an example from my district about why patenting is critical secretary babbitt has been in the forefront of those calling for an end to patenting he made very public statements regarding a mine near elko nv which he described as containing 25 million ounces of gold reserves and he was darn mad that he would have to grant title to the property and lose the opportunity to levy a royalty everyone agrees its a worldclass mine he told me in committee testimony that he was bbliged to follow the law and issue patents until the law is changed i took him at his word but where is the patent well it now seems secretary babbitt has concerns that endangered species consultation is necessary because a stream 7 miles away and outside the watershed of the mine i believe may have a fish in it needing protection his own professionals at blm have told him no hydrologic connection exists but he persists bottom line madam chairman if this gold mine probably the richest in america cannot satisfy the secretarys requirements for proving a valuable deposit exists probably no mine can is this the way we want the secretary of the interior to use the endangered species act as leverage over patent applicants to somehow make them obliged to pay a royalty that they otherwise would not i think not speaking of royalty let me reiterate my concerns this bill would send the united states on the opposite course most other nations are taking mexico dropped its 7 percent gross royalty over a year ago and is now satisfied with taxing miners profits as are canada south africa and gold mines in western australia the world bank advises developing nations to forgo gross royalties to lure mineral investments that pay many times over in their economic benefits yet secretary babbitt and the sponsors of this bill still insist upon a gross royalty formula they keep saying thats what coal and oil and gas pay but so what we all know coal royalties are paid by electricity consumers every month in their light bills and oil and gas it is valued at the wellhead before any cost other than pumping is added i would like to see the same scheme applied to hardrock mines value the broken ore at the minemouth after all it may be publicly owned minerals but its private labor that wins the metal from the ore why should uncle sam receive a cut off the top on these postmining costs he would under h r 322 despite the net in net smelter return it is indeed a gross royalty in my view the federal government is entitled to a share of the profits just as it is with any other business and other nations agree with me this is the reality of todays global marketplace lets take a look at the impact the royalty alone in this bill would have this chart shows the results of various model studies run on the data i show only 8 percent gross royalty numbers here but other numbers were crunched let me call your attention to the first row these are the interior departments own figures the committee report acknowledges the net job loss associated with this royalty 1 100 jobs that is not an industry sponsored study its secretary babbitts royalty task force that said this and this is a net job loss they are counting abandoned mine reclamation jobs as well as new bureaucrat positions needed under this bill against the real job losses of miners geologists engineers haul truck drivers and the like believe me the doi numbers are cooked because the static analysis doesnt begin to account for the retreat from public lands that this ultrahigh royalty would cause of course studies that do recognize this real life principle show much more job loss and losses to the unitedstates treasury the bill would likely cause we proved with the 100 holding fee that the miners do have alternatives they drop their claims and go elsewhere omb estimated 97 million would be collected from the firsttime rental fee blm actually received only 51 million or so so much for executive branch scoring back to job losses i have here on the poster a quote from president clinton he made while speaking about nafta i believe he is sincere about not wanting to knowingly cause job losses but his guys down at interior are causing him to misspeak whatever your vote will be tomorrow on nafta i think we all agree that job lossor creationis the motivating factor well here we have a bill that indisputably causes job loss i think major losses but this body is prepared to pass it anyway we have got to get to conference with a tough position says the chairman because the senate bill is so weak i disagree strongly but more importantly why should the house vote to send good highpaying jobs to mexico unilaterally thats where our dollars are headed my friends and h r 322 will accelerate the trend greatly last madam chairman i would like to put a human touch to my remarks by telling you about elko nv the best small town in america elko is in the heart of gold mining country today more than onethird of its population is employed by the mining industry mining companies paid over 250 million in salaries and benefits to elko area employees in 1992 plus scholarships to young adults and donations for schools hospitals and the like mining is a good fit for this community whose residents i am proud to call my constituents they are hardworking people producers for this country we export much of elkos gold to help our nations balance of trade we should remember mining jobs pay the highest wages of all production workers averaging nearly 39 000 per year benefits as in health benefits so let me end by reflecting upon the candid statement of the sponsor of similar mining reform legislation in the other body senator bumpers actually said last july adios as far as im concerned why mine america first this extremely cavalier attitude shows he thinks his state will not be impacted by this bill but let me differ once more miners on nevada buy explosives chemicals trucks bulldozers and all sorts of other supplies and equipment from somewhere and usually its made out of state and we are talking mucho dinero as they say south of the border will the manufacturers be able to sell dozers to mexico at the same pace as to nevada i bet not so there will be an impact east of the mississippi madam

committee on which i serve marked up the unemployment compensation bill h r 920 which would add 5 7 billion to the deficit all of us can appreciate the hardships faced by the longterm unemployed however extending benefits to these individuals by adding to the deficit does not put these people back to work and actually hinders the creation of jobs by forcing the government to borrow more from the private sector indeed all we are doing 4s continuing to borrow from future generations to feed the insatiable spending appetite of this congress in addition recent reports show that the economy is improving during the last quarter of 1992 the economy grew 3 8 percent the highest level in 4 years this expansion lowered the national unemployment rate from 7 7 percent last june to the current level of 7 1 percent it is also worth noting that h r 920 would increase the deficit to provide extended unemployment compensation benefits to 17 states with unemployment rates less than 6 percent clearly if an unemployment emergency exists it is not nationwide as h r 920 suggests congress recognized these regional differences during its conslderatlon of last years extended unemployment ompensation bill when it enacted a me aim to enable individual states to trigger extended benefits in the future without congressional action under this arrangement 21 states would qualify on march 6 1993 for extended benefits with the federal unemployment compensation trust fund financing half the cost of the benefit currently these 21 states have a net balance of 16 billion in their trust funds and all they have to do to extend benefits is pass legislation to enact the prograr rathehai allow individual state le slatures to decide this issue for themselves k r 920 would circumvent the states

controversial issues we saw it during last falls debate on true spending cuts when a sleightofhand substitute was offered so members could sound tough but do next to nothing and we saw it again when fiscal conservatives offered real spending offsets to pay for necessary disaster relief and were cut off at the pass even our distinguished rules committee chairman joe moakley has acknowledged the
