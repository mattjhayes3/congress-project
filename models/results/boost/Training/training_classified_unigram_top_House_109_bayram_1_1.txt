that is what this is all about i am glad i had the opportunity to update the gentlewomans perspective on that the 6ther thing i would note is that again this would be the only federal agency treated in this manner the only federal agency and there is really no justification for it i have heard a great deal about budget scoring and i cannot speak as to the author of this amendment but i suspect he along with others including myself stood in the well of this house many many times and spoke about the moronic perspective of scoring when it came to tax cuts we did not want that kind of scoring the

hensarling amendment is adopted the postal service will be in worse financial situation then it occupied before the csrs overfunding was identified and corrected if the hensarling amendment is adopted

maintain a strong divisive bloody insurgency in iraq they know they only win if they can keep the iraqi people feeling despondent for their future let me be clear the litmus test for whether or troops

it out in conference however there is a decent chance that will not happen it is true that people who act out of hate can and do cause devastation and severe hurt there is no question about that those who cause such harm deserve and should be punished severely as a former judge i have sentenced and severely punished people acting out of hate including signing legal orders that the perpetrators should be put to death ironically the cases often cited as a basis for creating hate crime laws usually include the horrible dragging death of the african american in texas or the poor young man in texas who was killed for being a homosexual the main perpetrators in those cases got the death penalty that i believe they deserved those were cases in which no hate crime law would have made any difference whatsoever yet they are constantly cited as a reason for it in the dragging death case i personally might support punishment by allowing the victims despondent family to choose the rope or chain and the terrain over which to drag the heartless defendant to inflict the death penalty but the hate crime laws do not offer a more painful form of capital punishment the one yesterday certainly does not so it would have had absolutely no effect on the very cases its proponents often herald as poster examples what was done yesterday created a vague ambiguous federal offense which sends a message that random senseless acts of violence are far more preferable in our society than such acts with a motive never mind that sociopaths or antisocial personalities who commit random senseless acts of violence are unlikely to be rehabilitated they will not get punished under this new law passed out of this house yesterday this new hate crimes bill that passed yesterday this body said to the world that sexual orientation and not just gender which should be respected but gender identity whatever that is are in the same category as those unfortunate individuals who have suffered because of the color of their skin or their religious preference have the members ever stopped tothink about the words sexual orientation regardless of what definition they may give those words when we pass laws the words used create an exceptional chance that at some point down the road someone is going to say the words mean exactly what they say in the case of sexual orientation someday someone can look at those words and say they have the very meaning they state that includes those who are sexually oriented towards animals those who are sexually oriented towards corpses those who are sexually oriented towards children that is abominable but someday those words could be cited by some appellate court as having their very plain meaning not just the meaning that is socially or culturally accepted at the time they were passed there is another aspect that is not discussed or debated but is coming some day through this new law it is true that the law addresses crimes of violence or attempted crimes of violence however under article 18 unitedstates code 2 a of the federal criminal code whoever aids abets counsels commands induces or procures a crimes commission is punishable just as if he is the principal do the members understand what that means let me ask my colleagues if a christian jewish or muslim religious leader teaches and preaches that homosexuality is wrong or is a sin and someone in the leaders flock commits a crime against a person who chooses to practice such acts has the religious leader counseled or induced such an act thrtough his or her teaching someday someone will say so and ministers will be arrested for their preaching they will be said to have incited such conduct through hateful teaching as a matter of fact some people already blame religious leaders for acts of violence in such cases and i do not defend any minister who encourages such conduct that should be punished e 1845 they are wrong but having harshly sentenced people who have committed crimes of hate and also those who have committed crimes at random coldblooded heartless thugs i can tell my colleagues that the victims and their loved ones in all ofthese cases are all traumatized and distraught and deserving of sympathy and compassion so what is the message our great hate crime legislation sends apparently through hate crime legislation we are simply saying to the world if you are
