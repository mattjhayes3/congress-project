convenient for whoever is speaking the fact is that central america has been a place of great desperation for a long long time the somozas dominated nicaragua for 40 years america conveniently extended support at times when indeed we should have been pressuring for change that did not come through democratic and republican administrations over too many years in my first session in 1979 that debate was raging and america had made a decision to push the somozas out in order to provide hope freedom and opportunity economic growth and change and suddenly after that crisis we began to give

has never seen 1 hours worth of hearings in nor any examination by the cor mittees of the congress who have developed the expertise in drafting health care legislation and in providing secure funding for it no one knows if the bill before us is financially sound i wouldnt oppose a bill on an important subject like this on merely procedural grounds but there is good reason for a sound process and this bill coming as it does directly to the floor from the pen of the sponsor without any intervening examination has bypassed every opportunity this institution provides to be sure that legislation

benefitsonly to find that it increased them too much we could not afford to pay benefits that generous without breaking the social security system so congress went back and tried to correct its mistake and presto the notch years were created in short congress was trying to do a good thing but it did not take the time to do it right we are about to do that all over again there is legislation in the senate to address the need for home health care there is legis lation being developed in the house to deal with this very same issue they are proceed ing through the regular process and they will come before this bodywith a track record of analysis that can demonstrate that it will be workable we should let those efforts proceed but trying to rush a measurehowever well meaningthat has

district shut its doors there was no notice given to the workers i was angry i thought the actions of the ownership of that plant were despicable and i thought what congress should do is pass legislation that requires that notice be given to the workers then somewhere in the back of my mind i heard the voice of an old priest that used to rattle around the halls of i oras college in dubuque ia he said the road to hell is paved with good intentions i cannot mimic him very well but the fact of life is that in this case the road to hell is paved with good intentions we all want to help workers and some think that by passing this legislation we will but i suggest to my colleagues the opposite is true the fact is that when layoffs occur they usually occur because of a lost customer or they occur because of commodity price changes let us say the price of corn has gone up and the ethanol plant no longer has a market or maybe there is a new competitor the sponsors of the legislation say those are unforeseeable and we are not going to have a problem with that but the fact of life is that if notice is not given by those employers they are going to be in a position where they face litigation so the bottom line is that this bill prohibits a private employer from imposing a necessary partial layoff in order to save jobs for other workers and that is what is wrong with the legislation at its most basic but there is another thing that is wrong with it besides the fact that it costs jobs and that is that it is directed toward small businesses the large employers are already covered most of them by collectivebargaining contracts and the rest of them ladies and gentlemen will thumb their noses at this legislation look at what happens in canada the large companies every other week put in their paycheck a notice which says in 30 days or 60 days we will be closing down and it occurs week after week after wcek and they get around the bill but the smaller businesses are not sophisticated enough to do that so it provides no protection from the large but it hurts the small so i suggest to my colleagues if they want more plant closings vote for this bill

announce purchases of several million bushels of united states grain last tuesday the delegation visited lincoln ne as it visited other american cities and yesterday it was in washington dc as a member of congress who represents a large and important agricultural constituency i certainly appreciate their purchase of american grain however as this korean buying mission tours the united states and with great fanfare announcing purchases of grain i wish they would also explain why they have such a terrible protectionist policy affecting many other united states agricultural commodities and processed food productsfor example their barriers against the import of beef while i try not be cynical about the korean purchases i can only conclude that one reason for the high profile given thcse grain purchases is an attempt to hide their protectionist import policies toward a variety of agricultural and food products the worst example is their virtually total ban on highquality unitedstates beef which has been in effect since may 1985 in light of the korean trade surplus with the united states of 7 3 billion in 1986a 72 percent increase in 1 year over 1985we deserve better treatment and more access to korean markets open united states markets and the international trading system have worked well for korea and koreans havw benefited enormously korea is now the 10th largest trading nation in the world and its 1987 exports of 47 billion exceeded the total gnp of many other countries in the world currently the united states is by far its largest trading partner and korea is the seventh largest trading partner of the united states in recent years korean exports to the united states rose dramatically increasing at an average 20percent annual rate today approximately 40 percent of all korean exports go to the united statesthats right an incredible 40 percent of their total export market is found in our country koreas recent feed grain buying spree in the united states is surely designed in significant part to mute criticism of the fact that the united states share of the korean agricultural market had fallen to its lowest point in almost 20 years in regard to agricultural trade korea exported more than 41 million worth of processed foods and beverages to the united states this represents a doubling of sales over the past 5 years in contrast united states food and beverage sales to korea slipped from 19 million in 1982 to 18 million in 1986 in response to trade policy measu es designed to keep highvalue agricultural product imports to a minimum while promoting their exports there are small amounts of trade in the international interest but the trends are unfortunately significant we know however that a market exists in korea for united states food products by the fact that so much of it is being illegally sold out of a united states military post and base exchanges most of the discussion regarding united states beef exports has been focused on the expiration of the united statesjapanese agreement on their beef quotas however koreas outright ban on imported beef should be the initial focus of american policymakers and american people is it fair absolutely not and every american will recognize that when they know about the ban its outrageous in january 1987 we reached an understanding with the korean government that the united states would not file a gatt case against korea on beef in exchange for the korean govermnnts commitment to inprove access for other agricultuial products and a resumption of beef imports by the end of 1987 the government of korea has reneged theyve broken their promise to the cou try that is the destination of 40 percent of their total exports theyve broken their promise to the nation that ensures their security against north korea aggression the 1987 deadline has now passed and the market remains closedslammed shut this issue has been the subject of intense and protracted negotiations so far little progress has been made with no results the outcome of these discussions on removing the ban and the quota on beef will be a test of koreas commitment to open its markets resolving the agricultural trade issues will reassure skeptics in the american public and congress that the administration can ensure and the korean government will at long last really provide fair market access for american goods and services it is a test of whether the government of korea will keep its commitments if the administration cant demonstrate convincingly that market access can be achieved in countries which have very large trade surpluses with the united states the concerns of many americans about unfair trade practices among our international trading partners will grow and there will be that much less likelihood of removing the more extreme protectionst trade provisions from the omnibus trade bill which is currently in conference at this time a quite appropriate section 301 case regarding koreas treatment of the united states beef has been filed with the office of the united states special trade representative independently the ustp raised the issue lt a gatt dispute panel last week in geneva switzerland while the united states was assured or placated last year that some liberalization would occur once the korean presidential elections were concluded nothing substantive has been forthcoming from the koreans we are now being told that no action may be taken prior to the upcoming parliamentary elections in korea because united states beef exports would be a sensitive political issue quite frankly a total ban on united states beef is a sensitive issue here too i would remind the korean government that we have been patient too long what will be the next excuse for inaction that is offered it is time to set these political excuses aside unitedstates cattle producers have had enough the time for stonewalling and excuses is over i would encourage the ustr to accept the 301 case which it has pending and to proceed full speed in prosecuting the case korea is no longer an impoverished country it now has a responsibility to play fairly in the world trading environment which has enabled it to prosper in light of our huge trade deficit with korea it is not unreasonable to have open access to the korean market the elimination of koreas restrictions on united states beef would be an excellent start if protecting korean beef producers is politically sensitive they can do the same thing that the japanese should dodirectly subsidize their beef producers they can pay them and permit the korean and japanese consumers to reap the advantages of more highquality beef at much much lower prices again thank you korea for purchasing our grain but please be fair and live up to your promises to remove the beef ban as the first step in an immediate action to begin a speedy phaseout of beef quotas we appreciate your grain and soybean business but given your huge trade surplus

resolution 262 passed by our committee is poor public policy in his history of england thomas macauley recounted the attainder in 1696 of sir john fenwick before the house of commons in england some hundreds of gentlemen everyone of whom had much more than half made up his mind before the case was open performed the office both of judge and jury they were not restrained as a judge is restrained by the sense of responsibility 0 6 they were not selected as a jury is selected in a manner which enables a culprit to exclude his personal and political enemies the arbiters of the prisoners fate came in and went out as they chose they heard a fragment here and there of what was said against him and a fragment here and there of what was said in his favor during the progress of the bill they were exposed to every species of influence one member might be threatened by the electors of his borough with the loss of his seat another might obtain a frigate for his brother from russell in the debates arts were practised and passions excited which are unknown to wellconstituted tribunals but from which no great popular assembly divided into parties ever was or ever will be free this account was contained in a case decided by the supreme court in 1965 in which the court discussed the prohibition against bills of attainder contained in the constitution recognizing full well that house concurrent resolution 262 lacks certain of the technical ingredients essential to a bill of atsindermost significantly it lacks the force of lawi cannot escape seeing in the resolution most of the dangers that motivated the framers to proscribe bills of attainder in the first place so powerful was the sentiment of the constitutional convention in opposition to the dangers of bills of attainder that the provison barring them passed the convention unanimously the supreme court has elegantly defined a bill of attainder as legislative acts no matter what their form that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punish ment on them without a judicial trial simply put a bill of attainder is legislative punishment with that view in mind of what the constitution innnded to prohibit the instant resoluticn would sem clearly to violate the spirit if not the letter of the prohibition the troubles of texas air are too known to attempt to recount in these brief remarks on one hand texas air has become the black ii 3120 sheep of american industry for its persistent labor unrest and unconventional labor relations in this regard management has attributed many of its problems to uncooperative workers on the other hand texas airs two principal subsidiaries eastern and continental have experienced service problems so severe that probably every frequent flyer in america has suffered in some fashion at their hands service problems as severe as this must have a multitude of explanations many of which i am sure would have nothing to do with its workers the point of all this is that texas air and its airline subsidiaries present the perfect example of the risk inherent in legislative punishment texas air has done enough things wrong to deserve some form of penalty and it has made enough enemies to assure a strong lobby in favor of its being severely penalized i cm concerned with congress being used as the tribunal of choice for punishing texas air whether or not the punishment is deserved lets look at what 262 calls for as a general matter it requests the department of transportation to perform an investigation of the management of texas air and eastern to determine its effect on the public interest in matters ranging from attention to safety to promotion of fair wages and cquitable working conditions the concern of the public with such matters is beyond dispute in fact the putlics interest is so great that the federal aviation act and the regulations that have been promulgated undr it are replete with continuing supervisory functions for the agencies that have oversight responsibility for airlines in other paragraphs of the resolution the secretaly of transportation is requested to do other things which are governed substantially by existing law and regulations while certain instructions could be regarded as a legitimate direction of the secretarys discretion most matters addressed by the resolution seem to have an intent other than to help guide the secretary for example paragraph 5 a now moot provision reads the secretary should not authorize orion air to provide services under contract with eastern unless orion establishes conclusively that it is capable of conducting such operations with the highest degree of safety since such a determination goes to the very heart of the federal aviation administrations function to suggest that it might need the exhortation of congress to fulfill its mandate is to attribute either great incompetence to the administration or great perfidity to eastern since i am aware of the great esteem in which the faa is held by members of our subcommittee i must conclude that it was the possible perfidity of eastern that motivated the passage af house concurrent resolution 262 i am not here to argue the virtues of texas air or eastern with apologies to the thousands of employees who make up these companies i have to acknowledge that i lack the information upon which to base a judgment about whether these comnanies are good or bad virtuous or wicked worthy of support or desering of termination even if i did have such i formation though it would not be my responsibility as a member of congress to sit in judgment over persons who are governed by laws of general application which this body enacts to the extent that congress takes actions which inflict a punishment upon private copanies and does so in a way that catches only the specified company and not others that may be similarly situated congress has usurped the roles of the judicial branch to judge and the executive branch to punish the separation of powers envisioned in our constitution was intended to allocate to each branch of government the power it was most capable of safely administering the passage of laws to reflect the will of the people was seen as the strength of the popularly elected legislative branch the meting out of punishment pursuant to these laws was thought to be a task best removed from the legislature thus the bill of attainder clause in the constitution as the supreme court has said that clause not only was intended as one implementation of the general principle of fractionalized power but also reflected the framers belief that the legislative branch is not so well suited as politically independent judges and juries to the task of ruling upon the blameworthiness of and levying appropriate punishment upon specific persons house concurrent resolution 262 is clearly punitive in its effect to be singled out by name in even a nonbinding congressional resolution is to be stigmatized in the public mind in a way that no company can welcome when he singling out occurs in the context of instructing federal agencies to perform tasks to which they are already substantially obligated aspersions are cast upon the company so as to cause real punishmenl this is especially true where the company is an airline and the implications relate to safety texas air and its subsidiaries may be deserving of censure or stronger penalties then again they may be wholly blameless congress has established rules and procedures for making such a determination if the rules we have enacted are inadequate to deal with a problem of the magnitude of texas air then i am confident that we can devise better rules when we eschew the difficult task of legislation and choose the easier job of condemnation we have missed the high calling of congress and we tread near to unconstitutional territory to conclude i fear that house concurrent resolution 262 is an example of the pettiness we can indulge in when we let wellintentioned concerns get in the way of defensible public policy i exhort my colleagues to take the

drafting health care legislation and in providing secure funding for it no one knows if the bill before us is financially sound i wouldnt oppose a bill on an important subject like this on merely

used to rattle around the halls of i oras college in dubuque ia he said the road to hell is paved with good intentions i cannot mimic him very well but the fact of life is that in this case the road to hell is paved with good intentions we all want to help workers and some think that by passing this legislation we will but i suggest to my colleagues the opposite is true the fact is that when

maybe there is a new competitor the sponsors of the legislation say those are unforeseeable and we are not going to have a problem with that but the fact of life is that if notice is not given by those employers they are going to be in a position where they face litigation so the bottom line is that this bill prohibits a private employer from imposing a necessary partial layoff in order to save jobs for other workers and that is what is wrong with the legislation at its most basic but there is another thing that is wrong with it besides the fact that it costs jobs and that is that it is directed toward small businesses the large employers are already covered most of them by collectivebargaining contracts and the rest of them ladies and gentlemen will thumb their noses at this

sandinistas would still retain power by means of military force i ask you to read this mornings washington post editorial exhorting members to approve the aid package noting that the record of the

again tonight however the moral of a part in the countrys economic the story bears repeating we can no choices longer afford totolerate foreigntrade but it is precisely because of these barriers to

nations that will be entering the stand behind your efforts but is ready international market in the future and willing to rush ahead of you with furthermore liberalization would trade reforms if it becomes necessary forestall the kind of protectionism turning to the republic of korea i that korea can ill afford as an exportwould first like to acknowledge the driven economy countrys astounding economic success i am not here to engage in koreastory it is difficult to believe that just bashing in the past korea has re40 years ago the economy of the coun sponded in good faith to united states try had been virtually destroyed by trade concerns and those responses the korean war as recently as 1960 are appreciated however there are korea still had an underdeveloped still major areas of disagreement that natural resourcebased economy with must be worked out and commitments an average per capita income of only that require better policing on koreas 100 its exports were insignificant

with meeting with their counterparts in domestic subsidies and import restrlc seoul at this critical time in united tions these policies gave way to an stateskorea trade relations when exportoriented industrial strategy both nations face new challenges and that has fueled a remarkable economic contemplate major policy changes expansion congress will be looking for the uptoday the republic of korea has an coming negotiations to strengthen an average income of 2 000 and is one of economic partnership that will benefit both the american and the korean people it is my hope the comments made tonight will send a message that even though congress is currently busy with an omnibus bill focusing on the big picture in trade we have certainly not lost sight of the smaller picture of our bilateral trade relationship with korea in all of this effort that the koreans have put forward to enhance their economy it is as i have mentioned a remarkable story in 1985 korea was our eighth largest export market purchasing 3 percent of our total exports in contrast that same year the united states was koreas no 1 export market buying 36 percent of koreas total exports the united stateskorea trade deficit though has been growing rapidly over the past few years the 1981 deficit of 200 million grew to over 4 billion by 1986 that is why i stand before this house tonight to talk about korea and the problems that loom ahead korea is not japan i repeat that they have shown a very goodfaith attempt to address many of the complaints that i have mentioned this evening and we applaud those attempts but must note that they do not address all united states concerns and in some cases are too slow to benefit either our producers or koreas economic vulnerability in 1983 the korean national assembly passed a 5year tariff reform package to cut general tariff rates down to industrial nations level by 1988 last year korea agreed to permit foreign companies to write life and other types of insurance policies in 1986 korea did not impose an additional 40to 60percent adjustment tariffs over and above general tariffs as it has done in the past korea recently completed a buying mission to the united states purchasing some 2 billion dollars worth of products in over 20 states now the korean government plans to open the entire color television market late in several weeks ago i announced that i was going to hold this special order this evening just today in the mail from the korean embassy the first time we have had mail from the korean embassy on this particular issue we get this announcement korea announces additional tariff restriction packages and this is datelined seoul april 6 the korean government announces today a sweeping tariff reduction package to further cut the duty on a range of agricultural and manufactured goods these effective july 1 1987 will affect 83 items in addition to those listed in the previously announced trade liberalization and tariff reduction schedule i will read those this evening because i think they are significant"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a feed grain buying mission led by the korea feed association president park chanyung has very recently been visiting various cities in the united states to announce purchases of several million bushels of united states grain last tuesday the delegation visited lincoln ne as it visited other american cities and yesterday it was in washington dc as a member of congress who represents a large and important agricultural constituency i certainly appreciate their purchase of american grain however as this korean buying mission tours the united states and with great fanfare announcing purchases of grain i wish they would also explain why they have such a terrible protectionist policy affecting many other united states agricultural commodities and processed food productsfor example their barriers against the import of beef while i try not be cynical about the korean purchases i can only conclude that one reason for the high profile given thcse grain purchases is an attempt to hide their protectionist import policies toward a variety of agricultural and food products the worst example is their virtually total ban on highquality unitedstates beef which has been in effect since may 1985 in light of the korean trade surplus with the united states of 7 3 billion in 1986a 72 percent increase in 1 year over 1985we deserve better treatment and more access to korean markets open united states markets and the international trading system have worked well for korea and koreans havw benefited enormously korea is now the 10th largest trading nation in the world and its 1987 exports of 47 billion exceeded the total gnp of many other countries in the world currently the united states is by far its largest trading partner and korea is the seventh largest trading partner of the united states in recent years korean exports to the united states rose dramatically increasing at an average 20percent annual rate today approximately 40 percent of all korean exports go to the united statesthats right an incredible 40 percent of their total export market is found in our country koreas recent feed grain buying spree in the united states is surely designed in significant part to mute criticism of the fact that the united states share of the korean agricultural market had fallen to its lowest point in almost 20 years in regard to agricultural trade korea exported more than 41 million worth of processed foods and beverages to the united states this represents a doubling of sales over the past 5 years in contrast united states food and beverage sales to korea slipped from 19 million in 1982 to 18 million in 1986 in response to trade policy measu es designed to keep highvalue agricultural product imports to a minimum while promoting their exports there are small amounts of trade in the international interest but the trends are unfortunately significant we know however that a market exists in korea for united states food products by the fact that so much of it is being illegally sold out of a united states military post and base exchanges most of the discussion regarding united states beef exports has been focused on the expiration of the united statesjapanese agreement on their beef quotas however koreas outright ban on imported beef should be the initial focus of american policymakers and american people is it fair absolutely not and every american will recognize that when they know about the ban its outrageous in january 1987 we reached an understanding with the korean government that the united states would not file a gatt case against korea on beef in exchange for the korean govermnnts commitment to inprove access for other agricultuial products and a resumption of beef imports by the end of 1987 the government of korea has reneged theyve broken their promise to the cou try that is the destination of 40 percent of their total exports theyve broken their promise to the nation that ensures their security against north korea aggression the 1987 deadline has now passed and the market remains closedslammed shut this issue has been the subject of intense and protracted negotiations so far little progress has been made with no results the outcome of these discussions on removing the ban and the quota on beef will be a test of koreas commitment to open its markets resolving the agricultural trade issues will reassure skeptics in the american public and congress that the administration can ensure and the korean government will at long last really provide fair market access for american goods and services it is a test of whether the government of korea will keep its commitments if the administration cant demonstrate convincingly that market access can be achieved in countries which have very large trade surpluses with the united states the concerns of many americans about unfair trade practices among our international trading partners will grow and there will be that much less likelihood of removing the more extreme protectionst trade provisions from the omnibus trade bill which is currently in conference at this time a quite appropriate section 301 case regarding koreas treatment of the united states beef has been filed with the office of the united states special trade representative independently the ustp raised the issue lt a gatt dispute panel last week in geneva switzerland while the united states was assured or placated last year that some liberalization would occur once the korean presidential elections were concluded nothing substantive has been forthcoming from the koreans we are now being told that no action may be taken prior to the upcoming parliamentary elections in korea because united states beef exports would be a sensitive political issue quite frankly a total ban on united states beef is a sensitive issue here too i would remind the korean government that we have been patient too long what will be the next excuse for inaction that is offered it is time to set these political excuses aside unitedstates cattle producers have had enough the time for stonewalling and excuses is over i would encourage the ustr to accept the 301 case which it has pending and to proceed full speed in prosecuting the case korea is no longer an impoverished country it now has a responsibility to play fairly in the world trading environment which has enabled it to prosper in light of our huge trade deficit with korea it is not unreasonable to have open access to the korean market the elimination of koreas restrictions on united states beef would be an excellent start if protecting korean beef producers is politically sensitive they can do the same thing that the japanese should dodirectly subsidize their beef producers they can pay them and permit the korean and japanese consumers to reap the advantages of more highquality beef at much much lower prices again thank you korea for purchasing our grain but please be fair and live up to your promises to remove the beef ban as the first step in an immediate action to begin a speedy phaseout of beef quotas we appreciate your grain and soybean business but given your huge trade surplus with us we can and do expect to be your supplier of quality grain and soybeans at competitive pricesplus beef and a whole range of food productswhich your consumers would readily buy if given a chance"]]}
