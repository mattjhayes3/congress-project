federal outlays exceeded 500 billion in fiscal year 1980 600 billion in fiscal year 1981 and are projected to exceed 700 billion in fiscal year 1982 if this is not enough to convince the members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment the very fact that the amount of federal spending per average household increased 46 percent during the 4 years of the carter administrationfrom 5 026 in fiscal year 1976 to 7 329 in fiscal 1980 is alarming and not acceptable to the american taxpayer ii18319 without a spending limitation members of congress can accommodate one spending interest and gain political capital without reducing other

for a potentially unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely noticeable but when the costs of all the programs are added the impact is severe the requirements of balancing the budget and limiting the growth in spending will give the taxpayers an qual opportunity to influence spending discussions through the ballot box under the balancedbudget amendment congressmen will be forced to remain aware of public opinion because the votes for deficit spending and tax increases will be voted directly on those issues this should result in an examination of priorities when programs are considered the spending limitation will force congress to make choices which should lead to more efficient government the american people are demanding that congress balance the budget today we have the opportunity to carry out the will of the people and this is one congressman who will be voting to support the people of this country it is clear that the american budget process is seriously

american system the elimination or sharp reduction in deficit spending and the limitation on spending will reduce inflationary monetary policies and allocate more financial resources to the private

similar directive calling for a personnel lottery for firefighters is being prepared the firefighters association the fraternal order of police and the washington post among others have correctly labeled the use of a personnel lottery in the nations capital as an improper attempt to achieve arbitrary quotas which will destroy a public safety system that is already facing serious problems i

aid to the poor in such a debate it is easy for the real issue to become obscured that issue is not whether we will provide legal aid to the poor but how the administration has requested that the legal aid program be offered as part of social services block grants in order to foil the administrations program the leadership has scheduled its preferred legislation at this time so as to deny you the choice between the two means of delivering legal aid that are pending in the congress must we accept an inherently defective framework for delivering legal services simply because it is the only

presidents theodore roosevelt spent 1 7 million franklin roosevelt spent 82 7 million john kennedy spent 210 5 million and jimmy carter spent 1 3 billion it took 186 years to raise the annual federal spending to a level of 100 billion it then took only 9 more years to double that figure to 200 billion four yeexs later federal spending reached 300 billion and in just 2 more years it reached the 400 billion mark federal outlays exceeded 500 billion in fiscal year 1980 600 billion in fiscal year 1981 and are projected to exceed 700 billion in fiscal year 1982 if this is not enough to convince the members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment the very fact that the amount of federal spending per average household increased 46 percent during the 4 years of the carter administrationfrom 5 026 in fiscal year 1976 to 7 329 in fiscal 1980 is alarming and not acceptable to the american taxpayer ii18319 without a spending limitation members of congress can accommodate one spending interest and gain political capital without reducing other spending programs and facing political disadvantages the political costs of excessive spending are deferred resulting in high inflation huge deficits and higher taxes while the political benefits of the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congessmen who support it a similar process and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely noticeable but when the costs of all the programs are added the impact is severe the requirements of balancing the budget and limiting the growth in spending will give the taxpayers an qual opportunity to influence spending discussions through the ballot box under the balancedbudget amendment congressmen will be forced to remain aware of public opinion because the votes for deficit spending and tax increases will be voted directly on those issues this should result in an examination of priorities when programs are considered the spending limitation will force congress to make choices which should lead to more efficient government the american people are demanding that congress balance the budget today we have the opportunity to carry out the will of the people and this is one congressman who will be voting to support the people of this country it is clear that the american budget process is seriously deficient it is also apparent that the public is concerned about federal spending and is willing to use the constitutional means to change the system in a september 1981 gallup poll 67 percent of those surveyed favored a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and restrict spending only 19 percent were opposed this support cut across traditional political lines the ultimate question then is not whether a constitutional amendment should 1 t ed but whether this is the best one possible house joint resolution 350 possesses economic and political virtues vital to the health of the american system the elimination or sharp reduction in deficit spending and the limitation on spending will reduce inflationary monetary policies and allocate more financial resources to the private sector the provisions that would force open votes he congress on deficit spending and tax increases will significantly reduce the budget process bias toward spending by increasing individual

district of columbia officials that things had to improve i am here today as the ranking member of the government operations and metropolitan affairs subcommittee of the house district of columbia committee to tell you that things are not improving they cannot improve under the shortsighted and misguided personnel policies that are being imposed on the police and fire departments of this great

similar directive calling for a personnel lottery for firefighters is being prepared the firefighters association the fraternal order of police and the washington post among others have correctly labeled the use of a personnel lottery in the nations capital as an improper attempt to achieve arbitrary quotas which will destroy a public safety system that is already facing serious problems i agree i believe the posts william raspberry said it very well when he commented the district of columbia governments insistence of bending rules and requirements until they produce some arbitrary personnel quota is illegitimate fundamentally unfair and destructive of popular support for affirnmative action my amendment is designed to correct that inequity by prohibiting the use of a personnel lottery in the district of columbia as it relates to the hiring of police officers and firefighters it will insure that individual meritand legitimate qualifications will continue to be the sole
