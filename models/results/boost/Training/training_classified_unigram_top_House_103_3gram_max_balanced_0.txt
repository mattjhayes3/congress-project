0.0, 0, "1 thank the gentleman for yielding i wanted to comment to pick up a little bit on the problems with the budget enforcement act of 1990 the public should be aware that those tax increases did not come up to a level of 30 billion a year when they were in full bloom the tax increases proposed in this package net tax increases come up to a level of close to 87 billion a year when you get out into the fourth and fifth years almost three times the rate of tax increases as in the summit agreement of 1990 i think it is important to note that the name of the game here is to try to reduce the deficit the reason we want to reduce the deficit is that roughly 60 percent of the savings in this country the private savings are consumed by government borrowing those are savinge that do not go into the 1rivate sector do not go into buying plant and equipment do not go into new job creation decrease our competitiveness and that is what we are all about the other weakness of the summit agreement of 1990 was that it did achieve caps on domestic discretionary spending and defense spending and those by and large worked although the initial increases were a little bit too great where it really failed was to get control of existing entitlement programs that brings us back to health care which i want to talk about in a minute but let it be said to try to clarify matters that what we proposed in the budget committee by republicans were no tax increases and spending cuts over 6 years of 430 billion the way i count it what the democrats have proposed are net new tax increases of 281 billion over 5 years and only 160 billion dollars worth of net spending cute now that does not include what we are going to propose as a supplemental appropriation bill as i understand it that totals another 31 billion whichwould increase the deficit for the most part in 1994 but probably trickling over into 1995 but i want to talk if the gentleman would bear with me just a moment further about health care costs there is no component of the federal budget or indeed of our economy that is increasing faster than health care costs on a national scale they are increasing at a rate of about 14 to 15percent annually close to four times the general rate of increase that is what really is pinching insurance companies pinching families and pinching your government medicaid in the federal budget last year increased over 20 percent medicare increased over 12 percent and the prospects for the future if we do not come to grips with the things that are driving up health care costs are for them to increase at that rate which is the principal factor for driving the federal budget deficit it was the failure of the l90 agreement not to get control of health care costs and entitlement spending that was out of control that has allowed the deficit to continue to grow to sap savings and create the pressres of a 33s0 billionplus annual deficit let me speak to this a little bit further because i am going to get more specific look out over the next 5 years the baseline cost on medicaid is expected to increase 66 billion if we do not do something the baseline increase on medicare is expected to increase 112 billion between the two of them increasing at a rate of close to 15 percent per year the president said in his state of the union message that as a part of health care reform he would hope to get health care costa in the federal budget and generally down to the general cost of the cost of living plus the demographic factors affecting those programs that would be somewhere in the range of 4 to 5 percent per year they are in fact increasing at three times that rate so we have a heck of a challenge we have in this congress we as republicans have it the democrats have it the president has it and the american people have it we make an attempt in our budget proposal to try to begin to come to grips with this but i can assure you that before this year is out when health care reform proposals are laid on the table we are going to be in for a second round unless we really come to grips with true reform that gets control of those things that are driving up health care

the days of fiscal irresponsibility in government were a thing of the past after listening to the presidents speech i must admit that i found it ironic that just 1 day later the ways and means committee on which i serve marked up the unemployment compensation bill h r 920 which would add 5 7 billion to the deficit all of us can appreciate the hardships faced by the longterm unemployed however extending benefits to these individuals by adding to the deficit does not put these people back to work and actually hinders the creation of jobs by forcing the government to borrow more from the private sector indeed all we are doing 4s continuing to borrow from future generations to feed the insatiable spending appetite of this congress in addition recent reports show that the economy is improving during the last quarter of 1992 the economy grew 3 8 percent the highest level in 4 years this expansion lowered the national unemployment rate from 7 7 percent last june to the current level of 7 1 percent it is also worth noting that h r 920 would increase the deficit to provide extended unemployment compensation benefits to 17 states with unemployment rates less than 6 percent clearly if an unemployment emergency exists it is not nationwide as h r 920 suggests congress recognized these regional differences during its conslderatlon of last years extended unemployment ompensation bill when it enacted a me aim to enable individual states to trigger extended benefits in the future without congressional action under this arrangement 21 states would qualify on march 6 1993 for extended benefits with the federal unemployment compensation trust fund financing half the cost of the benefit currently these 21 states have a net balance of 16 billion in their trust funds and all they have to do to extend benefits is pass legislation to enact the prograr rathehai allow individual state le slatures to decide this issue for themselves k r 920 would circumvent the states

are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind of ethics rules of this house u 1520 by doing that we would not create a new bureaucracy costing millions of dollars to the american taxpayer and infringing on their rights to contact their congressman under the threat of a 100 090 fine"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 minute is hardly enough time to describe our great republican leader bob michel we will undoubtedly be taking special orders in the months to come to honor this great man but for now two terms come to mind when i think of bob michel being a former marine myself the first term i think of is esprit de corps bob michel has been the spirit of the republican party for all these 38 years bob michel is a great man the living embodiment of all that is best about the republican party there is one other term that comes to mind when i think of bob michel that word that phrase is semper fidelis another marine corps term it means always faithful i think back to the first 2 years of the ronald reagan presidency when bob michel put his heart and soul into passing the reagan program through congress he made tough votes that were difficult to make cutting back on entitlement programs doing things that we should have been doing all along he almost lost the election because of it in 1982 but he was always faithful to his beliefs to the republican philosophy of limited government and to putting the vital interests of our country first we are going to miss that man dearly god bless him"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 thank my colleague for yielding to me we had quite a trip as the gentleman was i was very impressed with president salinas and his cabinet top grade top level people what he has done since 1986 has been rather dramatic we had a chance to observe that first hand the last time i was in mexico city was over 10 years ago we could see a tremendous change in terms of environmental concerns in terms of poverty but since 1986 the salinas government has done exactly what the gentleman says it has done it got lower inflation rates it has gotten lower interest rates it has frozen its spending it is starting to live within its means as a result of that their economy is starting to grow as a result of that their cost of living and their opportunities to buy more have more disposable income buy more products from the united states have grown as well since 1986 mexico joined the gatt"],

yielding i wanted to comment to pick up a little bit on the problems with the budget enforcement act of 1990 the public should be aware that those tax increases did not come up to a level of 30 billion a year when they were in full bloom the tax increases proposed in this package net tax increases come up to a level of close to 87 billion a year when you get out into the fourth and fifth years almost three times the rate of tax increases as in the summit agreement of 1990 i think it is important to note that the name of the game here is to try to reduce the deficit the reason we want to reduce the deficit is that roughly 60 percent of the savings in this country the private savings are consumed by government borrowing those are savinge that do not go into the 1rivate sector do not go into buying plant and equipment do not go into new job creation decrease our competitiveness and that is what we are all about the other weakness of the summit agreement of 1990 was that it did achieve caps on domestic discretionary spending and defense spending and those by and large worked although the initial increases were a little bit too great where it really failed was to get control of existing entitlement programs that brings us back to health care which i want to talk about in a minute but let it be said to try to clarify matters that what we proposed in the budget committee by republicans were no tax increases and spending cuts over 6 years of 430 billion the way i count it what the democrats have proposed are net new tax increases of 281 billion over 5 years and only 160 billion dollars worth of net spending cute now that does not include what we are going to propose as a supplemental appropriation bill as i understand it that totals another 31 billion whichwould increase the deficit for the most part in 1994 but probably trickling over into 1995 but i want to talk if the gentleman would bear with me just a moment further about health care costs there is no component of the federal budget or indeed of our economy that is increasing faster than health care costs on a national scale they are increasing at a rate of about 14 to 15percent annually close to four times the general rate of increase that is what really is pinching insurance companies pinching families and pinching your government medicaid in the federal budget last year increased over 20 percent medicare increased over 12 percent and the prospects for the future if we do not come to grips with the things that are driving up health care costs are for them to increase at that rate which is the principal factor for driving the federal budget deficit it was the failure of the l90 agreement not to get control of health care costs and entitlement spending that was out of control that has allowed the deficit to continue to grow to sap savings and create the pressres of a 33s0 billionplus annual deficit let me speak to this a little bit further because i am going to get more specific look out over the next 5 years the baseline cost on medicaid is expected to increase 66 billion if we do not do something the baseline increase on medicare is expected to increase 112 billion between the two of them increasing at a rate of close to 15 percent per year the president said in his state of the union message that as a part of health care reform he would hope to get health care costa in the federal budget and generally down to the general cost of the cost of living plus the demographic factors affecting those programs that would be somewhere in the range of 4 to 5 percent per year they are in fact increasing at three times that rate so we have a heck of a challenge we have in this congress we as republicans have it the democrats have it the president has it and the american people have it we make an attempt in our budget proposal to try to begin to come to grips with this but i can assure you that before this year is out when health care reform proposals are laid on the table we are going to be in for a second round unless we really come to grips with true reform that gets control of those things that are driving up health care costs"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 understand

in government were a thing of the past after listening to the presidents speech i must admit that i found it ironic that just 1 day later the ways and means committee on which i serve marked up the unemployment compensation bill h r 920 which would add 5 7 billion to the deficit all of us can appreciate the hardships faced by the longterm unemployed however extending benefits to these individuals by adding to the deficit does not put these people back to work and actually hinders the creation of jobs by forcing the government to borrow more from the private sector indeed all we are doing 4s continuing to borrow from future generations to feed the insatiable spending appetite of this congress in addition recent reports show that the economy is improving during the last quarter of 1992 the economy grew 3 8 percent the highest level in 4 years this expansion lowered the national unemployment rate from 7 7 percent last june to the current level of 7 1 percent it is also worth noting that h r 920 would increase the deficit to provide extended unemployment compensation benefits to 17 states with unemployment rates less than 6 percent clearly if an unemployment emergency exists it is not nationwide as h r 920 suggests congress recognized these regional differences during its conslderatlon of last years extended unemployment ompensation bill when it enacted a me aim to enable individual states to trigger extended benefits in the future without congressional action under this arrangement 21 states would qualify on march 6 1993 for extended benefits with the federal unemployment compensation trust fund financing half the cost of the benefit currently these 21 states have a net balance of 16 billion in their trust funds and all they have to do to extend benefits is pass legislation to enact the prograr rathehai allow individual state le slatures to decide this issue for themselves k r 920 would circumvent the states by deolaring the current unemployment rate an emergency and add the cost of extended benefits to the deficl for all of these reasons i urge my colleagues to vote for fiscal responsibility by defeating h r 920"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 week agothis

a host of substantive reasonable common sense amendments to h r 811 the independent counsel bill a bill which arguably affects every member members were sent here to paxticipate to cast tough votes we are expected to debate the issues listen to all sides and then make our best judgments that is the spirit of deliberative democracy no one said it should be easy comfortable or riskfree but the democrat leadership is bound and determined to slam the door on members with reasonable amendmentsin trying to protect members from being accountable to their constituents and to shut off debate on matters displeasing to democrat leadership time and again the majority assumes the most pretzellike contortions to avoid the tough votes on the controversial issues we saw it during last falls debate on true spending cuts when a sleightofhand substitute was offered so members could sound tough but do next to nothing and we saw it again when fiscal conservatives offered real spending offsets to pay for necessary disaster relief and were cut off at the pass even our distinguished rules committee chairman joe moakley has acknowledged the trend of finding an out for members uncomfortable with casting tough votes and so we have the rule today artfully crafted so members never have to really vote on the central question of whether members of congress should be covered by the independent counsel statute or whether once again we should be insulated from accountability there will be perception of a vote of course but a guided outcome is assured let us not forget that congress approval rating is sinking lower than the thermometer outside in large part because most folks are fed up with lawmakers who routinely exempt themselves from the law the ranking member of the judiciary committee mr fush asked our rules committee for an open rule to consider this bill my friend mr beilenson declared that this bill is a perfect candidate for an open rule he made the point that it is
