managed care reform act of 1999 with a vote of 275 to so members ask why is that bill not law yet why is not the congressional leadership leaning on the chairman of the conference committee to hold meetings is the conference dead if so then senator nickles should say so so that we can move beyond the failure of the conferences committee every day that goes by without passage into law of a real patient protection bill means that people are being harmed by hmos that care more about their bottom line more about their most recent stock quotes on wall street than they care about patients let me give some examples of people who have been harmed by hmos before coming to congress i was a reconstructive surgeon i took care of little children that were born with birth defects like this little baby with a cleft lip and palate do my colleagues know that in the last several years more than 50 percent of the surgeon who care for children born with this birth defect have had cases like these refused by hmos who call this a cosmetic deformity this is a birth defect the operation to repair this would be to restore towards normalcy that is not a cosmetic case under any definition a couple of years ago now this ladys case was profiled on the cover of time magazine this woman lived in california her hmodid not tell her all that she needed to know furthermore they put pressure on the medicare center treating her not to tell her because she did not get that information in a timely fashion and because her hmo did not play straight with her on getting her the treatment that she needed as medically necessary she died today her children and her husband do not have a mother and a wife a couple of years ago a young woman was hiking in the mountains about 70 miles west of washington d c she fell off a 40foot cliff she broke her pelvis fractured her arm broke her skull was lying at the bottom of this 40foot cliff when her boyfriend who had a cellular phone managed to get a helicopter in they took her to the emergency room she was treated she lived but then do members know what the hmo would not pay her bill because she had not phoned ahead for prior authorization was she supposed to have a crystal ball that was going to tell her that she was going to fall off a 40foot cliff so she could make a phone call to her hmo i have shared these stories with my colleagues in the past but i have some new ones tonight that are going to amaze my colleagues this is also a story a true story about a little boy we can see him here tagging on his sisters sleeve one night his temperature was about 104 or 105 degrees and his mother phoned the 1800 number for their hmo and said my baby needs to go to the emergency room he is really sick she got somebody thousands of miles away who said well i will only authorize you to take him to one emergency room and when the mother asked where it was the person said i do not know find a map it turned out that the hmo was about 60 or 70 miles away en route this little baby had a cardiac arrest if one is a mom and dad driving this little baby to the hospital members can imagine what that was like when they finally found it the mother leaped out of the car holding her little baby screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse came out started resuscitation they put in the i v lines gave him mouthtomouth resuscitation gave him the medicines and they managed to bring his life back all because that hmo did not have the common sense or decency to say if your baby isreally sick take him to the nearest emergency room because en route they passed three emergency rooms but they were not authorized by that hmo this little baby managed to survive but because he had that cardiac arrest he lost the circulation to his hands and his feet and he had to have both hands and both feet amputated why do 80 percentplus of the american public think that congress should pass an hmo reform bill a patient protection bill a real bill because their friends and neighbors have had problems just like some of those that i have shown the members a few years ago there was a movie as good as it gets in that movie helen hunt is talking to her friend jack nicholson and explaining how this hmo that they belong to will not properly take care of her son who has asthma then she let loose a string of expletives that i cannot repeat on the floor of congress but i can tell the members what happened in the theater that my wife and i were in it happened all across the country people started cheering and clapping and even standing up in applause because they knew the truth of that allegation no law has passed because the hmos have spent over 100 million lobbying against real patient protection legislation they have given generously to keepthat legislation bottled up in conference committee even worse the hmo industry is trying to get legislation passed that would undo the progress that is being made on behalf of patients in state legislatures and in the courts the gop bill that recently passed the senate the nickles amendment is worse than no bill at all in fact it is an hmo protection bill not a patient protection bill would members like some proof of this let me tell the members about some of the things that have been documented in a recent article in smart money magazine in their july issue l 2000 consider the case of jim ridler it was shortly after noon on a friday back in august 1995 and jim ridler then 35 years old had been out doing some errands he was returning to his home in a small town in minnesota on his motorcycle when a minivan coming from the opposite direction swerved into his lane it hit jim head on it threw him more than 200 feet into a ditch he broke his neck his collar bone his hip severalribs all of the bones in both legs it ripped his triceps muscle clean through over the next 4 months after a dozen surgeries he still did not know whether he would ever walk again when he got a phone call from his lawyer who had started legal proceedings against the driver of that minivan who had swerved into his path that call that he got from his lawyer really shook him up im afraid ive got some bad news for you said his lawyer he told jim that even if jim won his lawsuit his health plan wanted to take a big chunk out of it that they had spent on his care youre joking right said jim nope said the lawyer jims health plan had a clause in its contract that allowed the hmo to stake a claim in his settlement a claim known in insurance as subrogation so i pay the premium and then something happens that i need the insurance for and they want their money back ridler asked incredulously the way i figure it my health insurance is just a loan well ridler eventually settled his lawsuit for 450 000 which was all the liability insurance available his health plan then took 406 000 leaving him after expenses with a grand total of 29 000 i feel like iwas raped by the system he says do my colleagues know what most people are not even aware that these subrogation clauses exist until they have been in an accident and try to recover from a negligent individual like the person who almost killed jim ridler originally subrogation was used for cases in which care was provided to patients that had no health insurance but who might receive a settlement how"], [0.0, 0.0,

district out of the 1 000 miles of coastline in washington state it was certainly an interesting coincidence that the body lodged right on the beach in front of my house the death of this gray whale should call our attention to those who would like to reverse the will expressed in congress and by an overwhelming majority of the american people who oppose allowing the hunting of whales particularly for commercial purposes as i have been predicting from the well of this house and across america for several years the push for resumption of worldwide commercial whaling is on in earnest and it is not about heritage it is all about money we have heard that a gray whale can be sold in japan for 1 million those who want to end the ban on commercial whaling have been using the pretext of restoring whaling rights to indigenous people to expand the scope of whaling worldwide but if we allow people to use the excuse of historic whale hunting for resumption of whale hunting worldwide you have got to remember many nations most nations with coastlines hunted whales japan and norway definitely would have as good as anybody an historic whale hunting opportunity japan and norway are the most notorious now for going ahead and hunting whales newsweek magazine reported april 17 information i have already given this body that japan has been quietly packing the international whaling commission with small nations willing to do their bidding willing to vote for the resumption of commercial whaling we are dangerously close to a renewal of the barbaric practice of commercial whaling to millions of americans including myself this is totally unacceptable when the clintongore administration last year financed the makah tribal whale hunt and colluded with the prowhaling nations of the international whaling commission our nations government lost its moral authority to lead the fight against killing whales for profit this was truly a tragedy whales were hunted almost to

by some of the ijnovative reforms that we are seeing take place in state capitals throughout the land governors and legislative leaders republicans and democrats from states from california to new york are meeting their policy challenges in exciting innovative ways with our beyond the beltway project we are hoping as freshmen to open new doors for these leaders we know that for far too long federal rules and bureaucracies have held them back and smothered their efforts through unnecessary burdens and restrictions now the freshmen are reaching out to leaders like my own governor governor tommy thompson in an effort to help them unleash a whole new wave of creativity and innovation in state after state it is the freshmen who are initiating this project because even though we are members of congress we are very much still state legislators local officials and private sector small business persons at heart here specifically is what the beyond the beltway project will do the freshman class as a group have asked our governors legislative leaders directly and through the various associations to help us identify some of those federal rules and restrictions that are holding them back we want to turn these suggestions into an ongoing action agenda member by member and issue by issue we want to provide relief we are coming forward now with the beyond the beltway initiative because we have also introduced the first measure result from this new dialogue this legislation would direct each federal agency to develop an expedited review process for waiver requests as we know oftentimes states need federal approval or waivers to initiate their state programs if those plans deviate from the details of federal programs e0 0915 the idea of this legislation is that where a state has been granted a waiver on a particular program if another state seeks a similar waiver we believe that they should only have to go through a streamlined or expedited waiver review process we want to encourage the laboratories of democracy we want to encourage modeling we want to encourage benchmarking we want to encourage borrowing of ideas i would hope that my colleagues would join us in this expedited review bill and more importantly join the republican freshmen in developing beyondthebeltway ideas this is more than a shortterm project we hope it is the beginning of a new longer more

special order since that time we found out that there will not be votes tomorrow that they will not happen until tuesday the men and the women behind me and before me have come today to pay homage to our veterans i apologize for keeping them here on veterans day but i will be brief today is very difficult for many of us both memorial day and veterans day that as a retired navy person i was shot down on my 300th mission over north vietnam i understand and appreciate what this day means to veterans and what it means for their families for the active duty the reserve and the guard and for our prisoners of war wherever they may be this is our last meeting for veterans day of this century for we enter the 21st century in this next year like the human search for freedom this century our peace has come at a very high price throughout this cen tury for those of us that have seen combat andits horrors resist as a last means engaging into another war many have fought for different reasons in different conflicts but i can think of no other reason other than freedom that should rise to the top of reasons for conflict i would like to think as we enter this next century that the world would be free not only free for individuals but free of conflict but unfortunately it is still a very serious and dangerous place i feel serving on the defense committee on appropriations that it is even more dangerous than it was 25 years or even 50 years ago i would like to go through a couple of stories i think in honor of some veterans i heard this first story from ronald reagan as he accepted his inauguration on the capitol steps a few years back i would ask my colleagues if they have ever heard of a private named martin trepto a very famous individual i would say that no one listening to this speech or yourself mr speaker would know who he is but let me tell my colleagues his story martin trepto was a baker that made bread and rolls in france and during world war i he closed his shop and he volunteered to go to war because he thought it was his duty as martin trepto entered the battlefield he was assigned a position as a messenger they did not have the fancy electronics that they have today and many of those messages were carried in a couriers pouch when martin trepto got to the battlefield the three messengers ahead of him had been killed trying to deliver a message martin trepto volunteered to take that message forward to the front lines and like the other three messengers martin trepto was killed they found his diary and in his diary it read this has been a very difficult war i do not know if i will survive it no ti ce effective january 1 2000 the subscription price of the congressional record will be 357 per year or 179 for 6 months individual issues may be purchased for 3 00 per copy the cost for the microfiche edition will remain 141 per year single copies will remain 1 50 per issue this price increase is necessary based upon the cost of printing and distribution michael f dimario public printer but i must treat every action of mine as if that individual action would shorten this war and cause freedom for my friends how profound is that how many of us honor those veterans that gave their lives in some cases that served this country so that if every one of their actions would give us the right to stand here the day that i was shot down over vietnam the executive officer of the f92 commander blackburn was also shot down he did not come back his backseater steve hoodloff came back with the rest of the pows in 1994 commander blackburns son lived in poway california in my congressional district and from time to time his son would call and say duke can i come over and talk about my father it was the same questions and mostly the same answers well a few years later about 8 years they brought commander blackburns remains back now it is not like his son wanted to see his father come back but it was like a 5 000pound weight had been lifted off that childs back knowing the reserve and the resolve of what happened to his father that is why that if there is any hope of any pow or mia coming back that we must turn over every stone and do everything that we can possible recently i visited north vietnam it was very difficult pete peterson who is a democrat now the ambassador to vietnam asked me to come and raise the american flag over ho chi minh city for the first time that was also very difficult to do but i want to tell you that the men and the women of our active duty military and some of our veterans are doing everything that they can at least in vietnam to make sure that our loved ones know the resolve of their family members that did not come back from that war let me tell you about another individual on 19 january 1972 i was fortunate enough to survive and shoot down a mig21 over north vietnam one of five that i shot down when i got back aboard the unitedstatess constellation all 5 000 guys were up on the flight deck we were trying to get the wings folded my backseater willie driscoll and i get the arm switches safe i looked over at the side of the aircraft and there were the 5 000 guys with captain james d ward who was skipper of the unitedstatess connie admiral hutch cooper was commander of task force 77 and there was my plane captain willie lincoln white with a big smile on his face he broke through the crowd mr speaker he knocked over admiral cooper and you do not do that in the navy as he broke through the crowd he ran back under the tail feathers of the airplane and jumped up on the port wing and he came down the turtle back as i am trying to get the ejection seat pinned into the airplane and he grabbed me by the arm and he said lieutenant cunningham lieutenant cunningham we got our mig today didnt we what was willie white telling me mr speaker that he was a very important member of a team that he was a united states serviceman that i only deserved about onefivethousandth of the credit from ramirez the filipino cook that used to fix our double egg double cheese double fry burger every night to the guys that put the hydraulic pumps in the airplane to the fuel if you can imagine an ordnance man forgetting to put an umbilical cord on a missile or a gun so that it did not work they all deserve credit that is who we honor today those veterans who served this country i saw plane captains cry when their pilots did not come back that is how intense and how dedicated they were let me talk of another hero a veteran he has asked me not to tell his name and he is alive today if i can get through this i have a good friend that was a prisoner in vietnam and it took him almost 5 years to knit an american flag on the inside of his shirt as a prisoner of war in hanoi and on occasion he would take off his shirt whenever they got together with one or two prisoners and they would hang the shirt with the flag above them to symbolize freedom and that was fine until the vietnamese guards broke in one day and they ripped his shirt to shreds they took out this prisoner and they brutally beat him all day long when they brought him back he was unconscious he had broken bones so bad that his fellow prisoners did not think he would survive and so they took him and put him on a bale of straw and comforted him as much as they could and went back and huddled in a corner a few minutes later they heard a stirring from the pow he had dragged himself to the center of the floor and started gathering those bits of thread to knit another american flag that is what veterans day is it stands for freedom it stands for the constitution of this great country i would look at the conflicts that we have had over the last 5 years and i think foreign policy with military policy in many cases has been wrong in my opinion our military today is at the lowest that i have ever seen it in 30 years of military service we are keeping only about 23 percent of our military our enlisted in we are retaining only about 30 percent of our pilots many will say well it is just the economy because they are going out for the jobs and away from the military that is partially true but the primary reason is when i talk to these young men and women that are serving on active duty they are away from their families from their wives and from their children in some cases husband and children for 8 months out of the year and in some cases this has been 4 years in a row this is during peacetime that is hard for anybody to be away from their family at 8 months at a time each year in somalia we lost 22 rangers because the white house refused to give them armor it took us 17 hours to get into mogadishu by the time we got there we had lost 22 rangers this was the third time that our military leaders had asked for armor yet in somalia the warlords are still there general aideed has died but his son is still there and it cost us billions of dollars in haiti we are still spending 20 million a year in haiti the warlords are still there aristide is still there and that cost us billions of dollars iraq we went in four times over the last 2 years each time that mr ritter and them were rejected from inspection we went to war it has cost us billions of dollars and today we are spending a billion dollars not a million dollars but a billion dollars a year still in iraq bosnia has cost this country 16 billion that does not account for next year or the following years we bombed an aspirin factory in sudan the white house just settled for 50 million because of a mistake in kosovo the total number of people killed in kosovo before us the united states and nato going into kosovo was 1 012 onethird of those were serbs that were killed by the kla we destroyed an infrastructure of an entire country we lost thousands of people thousands of people were thrust out of their homes and today look at the results ninety percent of the serbs have been ethnically cleansed out of kosovo by the kla one hundred eighty orthodox catholic churches have been destroyed by the kla and we are building two 350 million bases in kosovo the united states are we going to be there like we are in south korea or other places in the world and whether you agree with kosovo or not we flew 86 percent of all the missions in kosovo the united states 86 percent ninety percent of all the weapons dropped were from the united states and if we are to ask our active duty our reserve and our 5uard to fly in these conflicts and other nations not pay their fair share then at least nato needs to upgrade its equipment so that they can use the standoff weapons or they need to pay for it because before this congress today the great debate on are we spending social security and medicare money or not 150 billion in these conflicts in my opinion there are very few that the united states should have entered in i think it is time as j c watts said in the republican convention in san diego we ask god to come back into our country i think it is time to secure peace through strength i would ask mr president not through weakness not through bracs not through decreasing our defense budget but increasing it recently the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff every one of our fourstar generals said we need 150 billion to bring us up to where we can fight just two wars i do not want our men and women going to war and having to celebrate or recognize them during memorial day because we did not give them the assets it is time to honor our veterans our active duty our reserves and give them the resources that we promised and to our veterans as well because as we honor our veterans today many of the fellows that i served with the men and women are telling their children not to enter active duty service because their benefits have been eroded well this congress in a very bipartisan way with the veterans bill and with the defense bill came to that call we provided 1 7 billion increase for veterans medical health care the largest increase since the 1980s the total funding is 19 billion for our veterans it provides a 5 million increase for veterans medical and prosthetic research it provides 51 million for the veterans benefit administration to expedite claims processing many of my veterans and the veterans of every member in this body have got veterans saying that those claims take too long we more than doubled the presidents request for veterans state extended care my veterans in san diego county wrote a bill called subvention it enables our veterans to use medicare at military hospitals it actually saves money but yet we are still limited to a pilot project our veterans are saying they are tired of bandaids for their promised health care we need to pass the fehbp for veterans if you have an active duty military and you have a civilian that sits next to them when they retire the civilian gets fehbp which is a supplemental to medicare the military does not that is wrong we could help our veterans by passing that as a full substitute and to help them do that as well let me close with what i think this day represents on the 10th of may 1972 i was shot down over vietnam in coming down in a parachute i thought i ws going to be a prisoner of war or even killed since the enemy was down below air force marine and navy pilots risked their lives to get my backseater and i out in coming down in that parachute they told us there were two things that would keep you alive one was having a good family back home and the other was faith in god i would tell my veterans there is going to be a time in each and every one of your lives maybe you lose a loved one maybe you lose your job but if you get on your knees and you say a little prayer i guarantee somebody is going to listen to you it is time to invite god back into this country i think as we look forward into the 21st century how exciting it is not just communications but health care research and the things that we can do to take care of our veterans i would close by saying god bless the veterans god bless the active the guard and the reserves and to our mias and our families do not give up hope god bless america"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "yesterday the newspapers across the country trumpeted a headline here is one from the washington post similar to newspapers all across the country hmo to

here a couple of weeks ago oh no we dont make medical decisions we just make determinations of benefits and then they said but if you pass the legislation it is going to cost so much more premiums will go up and guess what one of the two cornerstones of the legislation that passed this house was on the determination of medical necessity physicians and patients would make the decision now the second largest hmo in this country is saying hey do you know what we found out that it cost us more money to micromanage those decisions so we are not going to do it anymore that certainly undercuts their arguments about increases in premiums does it not on october 7 the house of representatives sent a message to the senate get real about protecting patients for all citizens from hmo abuses we passed remarkably a bipartisan consensus managed care reform bill by the margin of 275 to 151 the american public is now demanding real action on this issue how do i know that a recent survey the washington post did a survey to better understand americans concerns more than 2 000 people were asked 51 things that might be worrying them do members know what the top worry in the public is today by 66 percent of people who worry about it to a great deal according to the survey their worry is that insurance companies are making decisions about medical care that doctors and patients should be making do members know what else the survey showed the same thing between democrats the same thing between republicans the same thing between independents do members know what else the survey showed it did not matter whether they were supporting al gore or bill bradley or george w bush this was still number one on the publics mind so guess what we did during that debate we voted on the senate bill in the form of the boehner amendment what did the house do it overwhelmingly defeated the senate bill because it is a sham bill that senate bill in this house only got 145 votes and 284 votes against it just a few days ago the house voted again by a vote of 257 to 167 the house instructed conferees to support the housepassed bill the norwooddingellganske bill why did the house have to do

heck i never even saw joe dimaggio play he retired 14 years before i was born certainly it was on the field where joe dimaggio earned his glory but it was off the field where he earned his respect and the everlasting admiration of millions joe dimaggio lived a life with grace dignity integrity and humility this is what i believe made joe dimaggio so very very special over time celebrities puncture our culture or splash onto the scene only to disappear after what seems like a moment these fleeting stars that society grabs and lets go so quickly grab the big headlines go to the best parties or are seen with the right people joe dimaggio on the other hand was timeless he grabbed a part of an era the world war ii generation that some think is the best and carried it with class until the day he died unlike many of those celebrities joe dimaggio enjoyed universal love why the spontaneous standing ovations when he walked into a restaurant 47 years after he left the game of baseball because the people of this country still acknowledge greatness in their own special way to many joe dimaggio represented the wonders and goodness of man and this great country america you see to many in this

millions of people who love life the united states of america baseball and yes the yankees and not necessarily in that order and these folks loved joe dimaggio mr dimaggio embraced new york city and made it special and new york city embraced joe dimaggio and will never let him go and also what joe dimaggio represented son of an immigrant from italy who personified all the goodness of the great contributions italians have made to build this great country he was proud of his italian heritage but he loved this country when joe dimaggio retired from baseball he still had what others would argue is a few good years left but not for mr dimaggio he walked away because he had standards history will record those standards along with the hitting streak the grace the quiet dignity and integrity which will forever be the hallmark of one of the greatest baseball players of all time so no more opening days just memories and a celebration of a wonderful life i wish i could say it aint so but the

abuses we passed the norwooddingellganske bipartisan consensus managed care reform act of 1999 with a vote of 275 to so members ask why is that bill not law yet why is not the congressional leadership leaning on the chairman of the conference committee to hold meetings is the conference dead if so then senator nickles should say so so that we can move beyond the failure of the conferences committee every day that goes by without passage into law of a real patient protection bill means that people are being harmed by hmos that care more about their bottom line more about their most recent stock quotes on wall street than they care about patients let me give some examples of people who have been harmed by hmos before coming to congress i was a reconstructive surgeon i took care of little children that were born with birth defects like this little baby with a cleft lip and palate do my colleagues know that in the last several years more than 50 percent of the surgeon who care for children born with this birth defect have had cases like these refused by hmos who call this a cosmetic deformity this is a birth defect the operation to repair this would be to restore towards normalcy that is not a cosmetic case under any definition a couple of years ago now this ladys case was profiled on the cover of time magazine this woman lived in california her hmodid not tell her all that she needed to know furthermore they put pressure on the medicare center treating her not to tell her because she did not get that information in a timely fashion and because her hmo did not play straight with her on getting her the treatment that she needed as medically necessary she died today her children and her husband do not have a mother and a wife a couple of years ago a young woman was hiking in the mountains about 70 miles west of washington d c she fell off a 40foot cliff she broke her pelvis fractured her arm broke her skull was lying at the bottom of this 40foot cliff when her boyfriend who had a cellular phone managed to get a helicopter in they took her to the emergency room she was treated she lived but then do members know what the hmo would not pay her bill because she had not phoned ahead for prior authorization was she supposed to have a crystal ball that was going to tell her that she was going to fall off a 40foot cliff so she could make a phone call to her hmo i have shared these stories with my colleagues in the past but i have some new ones tonight that are going to amaze my colleagues this is also a story a true story about a little boy we can see him here tagging on his sisters sleeve one night his temperature was about 104 or 105 degrees and his mother phoned the 1800 number for their hmo and said my baby needs to go to the emergency room he is really sick she got somebody thousands of miles away who said well i will only authorize you to take him to one emergency room and when the mother asked where it was the person said i do not know find a map it turned out that the hmo was about 60 or 70 miles away en route this little baby had a cardiac arrest if one is a mom and dad driving this little baby to the hospital members can imagine what that was like when they finally found it the mother leaped out of the car holding her little baby screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse came out started resuscitation they put in the i v lines gave him mouthtomouth resuscitation gave him the medicines and they managed to bring his life back all because that hmo did not have the common sense or decency to say if your baby isreally sick take him to the nearest emergency room because en route they passed three emergency rooms but they were not authorized by that hmo this little baby managed to survive but because he had that cardiac arrest he lost the circulation to his hands and his feet and he had to have both hands and both feet amputated why do 80 percentplus of the american public think that congress should pass an hmo reform bill a patient protection bill a real bill because their friends and neighbors have had problems just like some of those that i have shown the members a few years ago there was a movie as good as it gets in that movie helen hunt is talking to her friend jack nicholson and explaining how this hmo that they belong to will not properly take care of her son who has asthma then she let loose a string of expletives that i cannot repeat on the floor of congress but i can tell the members what happened in the theater that my wife and i were in it happened all across the country people started cheering and clapping and even standing up in applause because they knew the truth of that allegation no law has passed because the hmos have spent over 100 million lobbying against real patient protection legislation they have given generously to keepthat legislation bottled up in conference committee even worse the hmo industry is trying to get legislation passed that would undo the progress that is being made on behalf of patients in state legislatures and in the courts the gop bill that recently passed the senate the nickles amendment is worse than no bill at all in fact it is an hmo protection bill not a patient protection bill would members like some proof of this let me tell the members about some of the things that have been documented in a recent article in smart money magazine in their july issue l 2000 consider the case of jim ridler it was shortly after noon on a friday back in august 1995 and jim ridler then 35 years old had been out doing some errands he was returning to his home in a small town in minnesota on his motorcycle when a minivan coming from the opposite direction swerved into his lane it hit jim head on it threw him more than 200 feet into a ditch he broke his neck his collar bone his hip severalribs all of the bones in both legs it ripped his triceps muscle clean through over the next 4 months after a dozen surgeries he still did not know whether he would ever walk again when he got a phone call from his lawyer who had started legal proceedings against the driver of that minivan who had swerved into his path that call that he got from his lawyer really shook him up im afraid ive got some bad news for you said his lawyer he told jim that even if jim won his lawsuit his health plan wanted to take a big chunk out of it that they had spent on his care youre joking right said jim nope said the lawyer jims health plan had a clause in its contract that allowed the hmo to stake a claim in his settlement a claim known in insurance as subrogation so i pay the premium and then something happens that i need the insurance for and they want their money back ridler asked incredulously the way i figure it my health insurance is just a loan well ridler eventually settled his lawsuit for 450 000 which was all the liability insurance available his health plan then took 406 000 leaving him after expenses with a grand total of 29 000 i feel like iwas raped by the system he says do my colleagues know what most people are not even aware that these subrogation clauses exist until they have been in an accident and try to recover from a
