disagreement on the extension of the continuing resolution for 1982 there were 75 amendments in disagreement and many more individual items within those amendments we met virtually nonstop for 3 days and we were highly consc~ous of the imminent shutdown of many federal activities i support the conference agreements and urge you to do likewise there are several items in true disagreement and i will speak to one or two of those items in a moment but first i want to outline the conference agreements on several matters of general interest the conferees recommend a 2percent spending cut which applies pro portionally to all programs projects and activities funded by the continuing resolution in seven appropriation bills district of columbia energy and water development housing and urban development interior labor health and human services and education military construction trensury and postal service individual reductions were made in three billsagriculture commercejusticestatejudiciary and transportation these cuts equaled or exceeded the cuts that would have been made under the 2percent formula a 2percent cut was made in the defense bill to be applied to procurement and research and development after the end of this session of congress the rate for the defense bill will be the conference agreement if we have one by that time and if not the level will be the lower of the house or senate figure we excluded entitlements general revenue sharing the food stamp program and veterans medical care and we provided that the 2percent cut could not be used to terminate any project or activity the 2percent cut applies only to funds made available by the continuing resolution and therefore stops if and when the appropriation bill for fiscal 1982 is enacted into law it is important that the house understand that although the language of the 2percent cut appears to app~ly to defense and the statement of managers refers to a cut in defense 3 9 billion in fact the amendment is worded so that the cut could operate at most until sine die adjournment and the actual cut would be insignificant and to his credit the chairinls estimates of the 2percent cut do not include any cut in defense the expiration date of the continuing resolution is july 15 1982 tile chairman and i fought and argued for the house date of september 30 1982 which would have provided continuing appropriations for the full fiscal year we finally had to compromise with the senate which had voted overwhelmingly for a termination date of march 30 1982 although i was willing to compromise i am still convinced that an extension for a full year would have been in the best interests of the congress and the appropriations process members of the other body argued that a continuing resolutilon for a fuli year made a mockery of the appropriations process what nonsensewith only one bill enacted they were saying in effect that a continuing resoiution for 9 months is all right but that a continuing resolution for an additionai 3 months is a mockery a continuing resolution for a full year does not in any way precludi the congress from final action on any of the 1982 appropriation bills in fact by extending the resolution only through july 15 we have guaranteed ourselves the ordeal of another extension which will interfere with our work on the 1983 budget and make it more difficult for us to enact appropriation bills for 1983 and require an extensive continuing resolution for 1983 to put it bluntly the members of the other body who fought so hard for a shorter extension in the namne of the appropriations process have made it more difficult for us to operate thlat1 process in a timely and responsible manner next year we estimate that budget authority provided by the conference agreement totals 427 9 billion which is 530 million under the amount that would have been available based on the provisions of the senate continuing resolution and 764 million uinder the president s september budget est~i mates i wish i could tell you that we have cut enough so that the president w~ill sign the bill however we can estimate budget authority but we cannot provide you with reliable outlay estimates for a bill of this magnitude where the conference agreement was reached only hours ago i am sure that at this very moment budget director dave stockman has his staff hard at work estimating outlays from the conference agreement dave is rightly concerned about the i ederal deficit and the related problems of cash management and debt financing 118783 however i would presume to offer him some advice this continuing resolution is not the place for 9 fight to the death over outlay estimates we are talking about funding for the entire executive branch and the judiciary we are talking about social security veterans benefits medical care housing education and health programs we are not talking about tile budget margin or growth rate for these programs but rather whether they will continue to operate at all after the next few days i hope the administration will not roll the dice for outlay estimates when the stakes are this high we are 764 million under the presidents septeynber estimates in budget authority and while i am sure that some of those cuts will not produce corresponding cuts in outlays i am also sure that the differences cannot possibly justify a confrontation over the continued operation of virtually the entire federal government assuming that the other body sustains the conference agreement i urge the president to sign this bill it is time for the president and the congress to clear the decks for the 1983 budget and the inevitable supplementals and rescissions for 1982 we can proceed with consideration of the

just that if we do we would be diluting a principle long observed over and over again we have affirmed an appropriate balance in our federalist system between the clear constitutional powers of the
