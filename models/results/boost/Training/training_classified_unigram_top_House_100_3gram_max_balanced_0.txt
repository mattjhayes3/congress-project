would continue funding for federal programs at current fiscal year 1987 levels from october 1 to november 10 1987 this 40day extension would hopefully enable the congress to hammer out agreements on the 13 appropriation bills it is important to note that if we held spending at this level for the entire fiscal year we could make a substantial dent in the deficit second the legislation also contains 3 5 million in humantarian assistance to the democratic resistance in nicaragua failure to provide aid to the nicaraguan freedom fighters at this critical time would be foolish abandoning the freedom fighters at a time when they need it the most only undermines their efforts to restore democracy in marxist nicaragua as we chalk up another year of being forced to pass a continuing
