was necessary to protect our country that we would do whatever was necessary to prevent future such attacks from occurring i recall there in east texas where i live i was a judge at the time the day after september 12 2001 was an extraordinary day as well it was a day that i also will not forget i had never seen communities come together as we did across america on september 12 2001 not in my lifetime in world war ii from history ive read accounts about some in america that felt like war with germany was a bad idea that we ought to be nice to them there were even people that were divided in america back then but the overall resolve was to protect democracy make democracy safe make the world safe for democracy was the slogan but we were so united on september 12 2001 there in tyler texasand i know it happened all over east texas the same waypeople came together it didnt matter what race anyone was it didnt matter where they came from their national originman woman religious preference didnt matter we came together as one people there were no hyphenated americans that dayno angloamericans africanamericans asianamericans we were americans we stood united and we wept together and we prayed together and we held hands and sang together here in washington d c once again today we sang god bless america without regard to party without regard to house senate i think there was less mention of the word god today im grateful for speaker pelosi who at the end of her remarks asked for god to bless and comfort those who lost loved ones on 9 11 and asked that god would still bless america im grateful she did that other leaders did not andy mccarthyandrew mccarthywas the prosecutor of those who were involved in the 1993 world trade center bombing he is a man that understands the constitution he understands the law he is a fantastic prosecutor a brilliant mind and a great writer and i wont read the entire article but its an article worth noting from andrew c mccarthy entitled remembering 9 11 at least for a day he says it is difficult to say whats harder to believe that it has been 11 years since the 9 11 atrocities or that national security has become an irrelevant issue in the most consequential presidential election in decades the first observation reminds us that today is a day of remembrance of the loss of nearly 3 000 of our fellow citizens of the bravery of those who willingly gave their lives to save others and of the heroism of the men and women who put on the line all that they have that includes the love and wellbeing of their families on whom the burden of american national security has been imposed while the rest of us go on with our lives too often without giving them a first thought never mind a second no matter which political party has been in power since 9 11 there has been a great deal of bloviating about the rule of law it is as if we had evolved beyond anything so crude and benighted as armed force and national interest especially national defense lets remember today that we have the luxury of living under something resembling the rule of law only because dedicated americans sacrifice themselves to confront evil in this case the adherents of an evil ideology islamic supremacism that is closer to the law of the jungle and for those who do not understandim saying this parenthetically its not in the articleislamic supremacism is not talking about all of those who worship and follow islam and islamic teachings we have friends around the world who do not want to live under totalitarian radical islamic supremacism such as the taliban such as al qaeda they dont want to live under that and theyre muslims they want to live their lives they want to worship in their own religion without totalitarians telling them how they must unfortunately as in afghanistan those muslim friends and pakistan for that matter iran and iraq as well there are muslims who have admired the united states until we abandoned them going back to andrew mccarthys article the rule of law has precious little to do with why we have gotten through 11 years without a reprise of 9 11 a better explanation is that terrorists who have been captured or killed cannot commit more terrorism ill insert parenthetically there are terrorists who were captured some confined at guantanamo bay some confined at other facilities who have been released and who have been found again on the battlefield killing americans they were captured prevented from enacting further terrorism and then released under some false notion that that would win friends and influence people only to have other americans killed by these same thugs back to andrew mccarthys article he says on the matter of evil it is good to remember that it exists evil is not a misunderstanding a cultural gulf or a natural reaction to political policies adopted in pursuit of american interests or israeli selfdefense that brings us to the second observation the fact that national security concerns are absent from the 2012 campaign even with tens of thousands of americans at arms in distant hellholes even with tens of millions of americans enduring the increasingly overbearing government that has been the cost of heightened vigilance in an era where barbarism is met with political correctness the united states defeated the ideological threats of the 20th century because we were unafraid to see evil for what it wasto diagnose it and understand it today we ignore it rationalize it and assume we are somehow to blame for it for the bipartisan ruling class 9 11 is about violent extremism as if irrational wanton killers seized by a psychological disorder committed mass murder for no better reason than to visit on the worlds most famous office buildings the most shocking case of workplace violence in history the violent extremism narrative is nonsensical it defies reality as well as history but it is a convenient fiction it miniaturizes the enemy with the killing of bin laden the president can now portray the enemy as defeated even as al qaeda resurges even as iraq has become an iranianinfluenced sharia state that works against the united states and israel he says parenthetically remember when victory was defined as a stable democracy that is a reliable ally and even as afghan islamists turn their weapons on their american trainers and the administration pleads with the taliban to negotiate remember when victory was defined as a stable democracy that prevents the taliban from returning and giving safe haven to al qaeda again the violent extremism canard allows the administration to declare victory even as we are being humiliated thats an excerpt from andrew mccarthys article regarding today it is tragic that around the world the united states has had allies who trusted us who put their security in our hands even to the extent of losing political power losing political office like some of the polish leaders who trusted america to help them with a missile defense it wasnt as much a defense against russia it was concern for potential missiles in the middle east that this nation has not done enough to stop but those who staked their political careers on the trustworthiness of the united states came up empty in poland mubarak had agreements with this administration met with this administration qadhafi had agreements with this administration met with them talked we had senators from both sides of the aisle although one of our republican senators says he didnt send that message it wasnt his tweet he says now that he was meeting with qadhafi and that he was an interesting man but regardless we know that there were people from both sides of the aisle that went and met with qadhafi because qadhafi after president bush gave the order to invade iraq qadhafi believed he was next if he didnt do something and end his nuclear proliferation so he did he became an ally even though he was a murderer with blood on his hands he reached agreements he promised he would not attack americans again and once again someone who trusted agreement with the united states came up short some of our allies in other parts of the world and other countries have to be wondering if theyre next i visited with leaders in other countries who say the chinese are constantly coming around saying have you figured out yet that you cant really trust the united states to keep their agreements hey you can trust us well whenever you come around including in israel there are chinese constantly there saying when you figure out you cant trust the united states were ready to be your friend your ally there should be no better ally in the world than the united states but we have different administrations and different administrations are better about keeping their words with allies than others the northern alliance in afghanistan fought with us and for us to defeat the taliban by early 2002 over the years they have buried family and friends who have been our cofighters against radical islamists in afghanistan we abandoned them this administration did not want to talk to them and i was told by some of the northern alliance leaders earlier this year that one of the leaders of the taliban that this administration released for humanitarian purposes ended up announcing hes back leading the taliban as one of their leaders and he announced on afghan national television that under sharia law if anyone in afghanistan had not been supportive of the taliban in the past they need to come in and ask forgiveness and get the talibans protection because as the leader said told people who watched the national television channel in afghanistan that everybody in the world knows the united states has lost in afghanistan 1940 back to the article cnn says the film in question is a dutch production the ap says clips of the film are available on youtube show the prophet having sex and question his role as the messenger of gods words this would clearly be insulting having sexual relations it questions his role as a messenger of gods wordsof course that would be insulting its ridiculous to have anything that resembles that just as it is absolutely ridiculous and despicable to demean christianity to call it a hate group when its bounded by jesus who showed the ultimate love for all humanity its despicable when someone burns a flag but its not illegal its not illegal to burn a bible its despicable but its not illegal yet personally i anticipate if history shows what the radicals will do they will follow the example unfortunately there will be more rioting somebody will tragically be killed by these cutthroats then some will say see we need to change the law in america where you can burn bibles you can burn the flag you can desecrate any religionjust not islam then the goal as found in the archives after a search warrant showed one of the 10year goals to be subjecting our constitution to sharia law and that will be a box that can be checked off back to the article after the protest the unitedstates embassy issued this statement on its web site the embassy of the united states in cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of muslims as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions how about the christians in egypt that are being barbarically killed for their religious beliefs wouldnt it be nice if this administration would condemn those activities and do what it takes to stop them today the l1th anniversary of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of american democracy we firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others the grand mufti of egypt sheikh ali gomaa strongly condemned the movie freedom of speech does not warrant desecrating sanctities gomaa said in a statement sunday and hes right but those freedoms exist in america the old adage that was attributed to voltaire for most of the history since including during the revolutioni disagree with what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say itused to mean something in this country now its been subjected to ideological terms that would have it say more something on the order of i disagree with what you say so i want you imprisoned i want you to lose your business i want you to have no friends i want to take all your money i want to destroy your life what a turn over the last 200plus years from our constitutions establishment and writing in 1787 of course it took longer than that to be ratified eleven years after 9 11 what has gone wrong you know not only were there mistakes in vietnam under both democratic and republican presidents our embassy was attacked in tehran in 1979 those of us at fort benning i didnt know of anybody that was dying to go but i knew an awful lot of people willing to go and die in defense of our country under everybodys definition of international law when you attack an embassy you have attacked you have committed an act of war against that country if the host country cannot protect the embassy then that country who owns that embassy that uses that embassy has every right to bring the full military power to bear to defend it i still carry the horrible realization i believe if we had defended our embassy in 1979 thousands and thousands and thousands of precious americans would not have had to give their lives since our embassy has been attacked in egypt if the government that the secretary of state has promised 2 5 billioni dont know some of it may have already gone over thereif theyre not going to be able to defend our embassy then we need to take action to defend it i also think its time to revisit the carterera idea that we should never take out government leaders i think its time to have this debate again which is more immoral to go to war with a country where at the time you go to war most of the people of that country like you and respect you and yet are going to die many of them or to take a position look its your country youre free to establish whatever government you want but if you put in place a government that declares war on the united states that says we are the annihilation of the united states their way their people then we will take that government out and we wont rebuild it youll be free to pick whatever kind of government you want its time to have the debate wouldnt that have been better in afghanistan rather than forcing a centralized government on a tribal region that has since become so corrupt that the money that we have spent spent by the billions in afghanistan given to afghanistan has made its way to other places besides the intended objects talking to some of our soldiers over there who have trained farmers they said the billions that have been spent and sent to afghanistan to create farming projects had not any of it made it to the region where they were training the farmers it was wasted effort so they would travel around over there wondering will they be the next ied death or will they be the next ied dismemberment the thing is a good foreign policy says the enemy of our enemy is our friend a good foreign policy says we will not try to buy off the bullies in the world to make them like us as ive said for years you dont have to pay people to hate you theyll do it for free save that money use it to rebuild relations with former allies that have been let down but dont keep giving money to people who hate us we dont need to be nation building we need to let nations live in peace under their own discretion but if they declare war or set as a goal our annihilation shouldnt we at least talk about taking out the government rather than going to war with the people i think its time to have the debate again theres too much death and loss of life in afghanistan its hard to believe 70 percent of american lives lost in afghanistan of our military have occurred under commander obama eightyfour percent of all the wounded have been wounded under the command of commander obama its time to talk about these things whether the presidential candidates want to talk about them or not we owe that to the people we have put in harms way as this is the anniversary of 9 11 its another opportunity for me to recall the memory of ross mcginnis i hadnt gotten an email from tom asking me not to forget he knows i will never forget his son but i went to his funeral at arlington national cemetery i had become friends since then with the mcginnises i have been to all the funerals of those who have died while in service in harms way from my district i have been to too many of those such funerals but this wasnt a person from my district in east texas it was a guy from knox pennsylvania a young man who graduated from high school and gotten into trouble at the end rosss mom doesnt want me to forget that he was given a second chance they let him graduate he joined the army and ross found his niche i havent seen any pictures anybody had of me during officer basic training at fort riley kansas in 1974 but i dont think i was smiling if somebody has them it was a difficult time it was hot humid but there are pictures of ross going through basic with other soldiers and hes got a big old smile he had a beautiful smile and the guys with him are not so smiling there are pictures of him after he got to iraq and the heat was obviously wearing down his friends fellow servicemembers but he has a big old grin his platoon sergeant told me that he was such a piece of enthusiasm in their midst he was uplifting to the other soldiers ross was a gunner on a humvee and as it was going through a town whether shot or thrown a grenade goes into the bed of the humvee where there were four of our soldiers including rosss platoon sergeant from long view texas cedric thomas a soldier from tyler my hometown sean lawson and two other soldiers and they said that ross yelled grenade and he looked back but ross was the only one in a position to jump out and save himself but when he looked back and he saw each of the four cringing in their corners he obviously knew those four soldiers were going to die so instead of jumping out and saving his own life and four soldiers being lost he didnt jump out he jumped in he covered the grenade took the full blow himself gave his life and four of our soldiers are alive today because of what ross did just as on the statue downstairs right below me below where i stand the statue of father damien the catholic priest from hawaii on the side of it is john 15 13 the words greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends ross had a lot of love the accounts after 9 11 after those planes flew into buildings here at the pentagon there in new york those incredible heroes on the fourth flight that went down in a field in pennsylvania those heroes went running in willing to lay down their lives to save others as ross did there at arlington national cemetery the army chaplain did a wonderful job taps was played it always gets me it got everybody there a 21gun salute is an emotional thing at a funeral and as everyone stood to turn to go sergeant thomas came up knelt down before the remains of ross put his hand on the remains of ross mcginnis bowed his head in prayer he was followed by two others that ross had saved the fourth was still in iraq they put their hands on rosss remains bowed at the knee bowed in prayer and it was obvious what they were doing whether its on memorial day veterans day the 9 11 anniversary there cannot be too many occasions when we as a nation stop and do what those three soldiers did thank those who have laid down their lives for the rest of us for our liberties thank those who have sacrificed life or limb or suffered terrible disability for us and our lives and our liberty and then to thank god for people who are still willing to lay down their lives for us with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "13 adults and one unborn child were killed and 31 individuals were wounded in a shooting attack at fort hood texas on november 5 2009 since that time the department of defense has taken no steps to award combat benefits to the casualties or even officially recognize the attack as a terrorist incident the house and senate have included two reform measures in the ndaa which we just passed while additional attacks have been attempted by similar highprofile radical islamic terrorists it is past time for the government to deliver on this act here we are almost 3 years later and theres been a recent report that has come out and in that report it references this incident of this slaughter of american troops on fort hood soil in texas it references that it shall be taken up as part of workplace violence the obama regime calls the fort hood shooting workplace violence sure its workplace violence its where they work and its violence but we have a concept of what workplace violence is and your normal workplace violence is not preceded by a shout by the shooter god is great in the arabic language its not preceded by discussions by the alleged perpetrator its alleged because he hasnt been convicted yet and we in a free american world take the position that all are innocent until proven guilty so we will call him the alleged shooter but theres clear evidence in reports by the defense department and by reports by the news media reports by witnesses on the scene reports by his fellow soldiers reports by folks from walter reed hospital where this americantrained militarytrained doctor worked that he had advocated that the american soldier was wrong and that he was contrary and he spoke and preached islamic terrorism so your normal workplace violence thats not a part of the factor yet this is what happened in this case senator collins on wednesday blasted the defense department and bless her for it for classifying the fort hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nations armed forces at home ive been talking about this now since the day after this happened we cant have a world where political correctness fails to define the criminal act by its very nature whether were talking about military law and the criminal relations in military law were just talking about criminal acts in general we have to be able to define them just to make the system work we have to be able to define them but more importantly we owe a duty and a responsibility to the american soldier to call an event what it is and not try to put a smokescreen over it or cloud the issue or in any way worry about the feelings of groups because the definition is the definition this man identified himself that he was committing this act in the name of god is great in arabic he acknowledged when questioned that it was part of his mission he acknowledged that he had dealt with terrorist spokesmen in the past and that the concept came from his interaction with awlaki and others so this guy is an islamic terrorist theres no other way you can describe this gentleman but now years after the event as he sits in the bell county jail in belton texas we continue to have reports coming down from our defense department that the folks that are responsible for our soldiers and responsible for those who died in this incident want to downplay this to be treated as an incident of workplace violence with all the white bread connotation that that has to me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so lets look at some of the evidence we have that connects this to islamic terrorism recognizing the november 5 2009 attack on fort hood texas as an act of radical islamic terrorism and jihad anwar awlaki connection now mr awlaki is no longer with us we have taken that boy out yet the bottom line is at the time this happened they were directly connected this man preached taught and encouraged violenceislamic terrorist violence hasans presentations to the dod on jihad justification he would argue with his fellow soldiers about the justification for having jihad against the american military mr hasan was a member of the united states army he was a major he had been serving in the medical corps as a psychiatrist he was trained with american taxpayer dollars but he was preaching jihad to soldiers and there was lots of evidence i had a bill which was included in this recent defense bill that we just passed it said that this guy was telling people that hed believed in this kind of thing since medical school now hes a major serving as a psychiatrist advising our soldiers hasan purchased and practiced with highcapacity firearms prior to the attack he went out and he bought firearms he bought them at a local gun store of the guns that were used in the killings one of them was a semiautomatic weapon with a large magazine capacity he went out to the firing range and familiarized himself with these weapons prior to this incident you cant think of this as some guy who goes postal all of a sudden this guy was planning this whole event he shouts god is great in arabic before he starts shooting but they refer to it in the context of the broader threat of workplace violence i think there is a very good argument that the evidence shows this was a premeditated act on the part of major hasan and i believe when this case finally gets to trial that the evidence will be overwhelming that it was premeditated at the time of the event lieutenant general cone the iii corps commander at fort hood told nbcs today show on the friday after the shooting that the soldiers who witnessed the shooting rampage that left 13 people dead reported that the gunman shouted allahu akbar which means god is great before opening fire at the texas post the day after it was being reported that he did this yet in the initial report that came out from the defense department the mans name didnt even appear the relationship to any islamic terrorism was not referenced it was like any major from any outfit just wandered in and started shooting soldiers like he was having a bad day or something now we get another comment saying that were going to treat this in the bigger scope of workplace violence certainly we want to prevent workplace violence in every workplace but the connotation is that this is just something that happened its not something that just happened because quite honestly since that time others have been caught who reportedly were trying to imitate this shooter mr hasan we introduced a bill the fort hood families benefits protection act it would award both military and civilian casualties of the ford hood attack with combat status to ensure full benefits and eligibility for the purple heart and other awards and for the civilian award equivalence to the secretary of defenses defense of freedom medal now why did i ask for that because there was a precedent for it when they flew the plane into the pentagon on 9 11 this is what was the finding of the department of defensethat it was an act of terrorism and therefore they should be treated as combat casualties and those two medals were awarded this didnt just come off the top of my head this is what happened with the first terrorist attack in our country and with the second or third or whatever attack this one was when this man walked into that room there were people in civilian garb and there were people in uniform he went out of his way to shoot the people in uniform the civilians who were injured were injured because of misfire or misdirection as he walked down that line his target was all of those soldiers who were doing nothing more than either coming back from being off post and out of the countryor wherever theyd beenor preparing for their next duty stations wherever they may be goingiraq or afghanistan they were being processed and they were in this big room he walked down the line shooting everybody in uniform now when youre killing our combat soldiers and when youre crying out slogans of the jihad terrorists why wouldnt you think its a terrorist attack and why shouldnt these people who died in the line of duty be treated like those at the pentagon who died in the line of duty in fact except for what we were able to put together in circumstantial evidence after the fact at the time of the incident we had no idea who flew that plane into the pentagon we just made an educated guess in this case before this shooting started the guy identified himself and what his mission was for some reason in this world of political correctness someone has the idea that this is good for the morale of our military soldiers or that its good for something as i think the chief of staff said when this happened oh this is sure going to hurt our islamic outreach program whether its good for that or not i hold nothing against the islamic people nor does anybody at fort hood but we hold a lot against islamic terrorists who kill soldiers and the

got a phone call telling me congratulations finally those precincts came in and"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "you probably get the same questions i get when i go back home those questions are from folks who came they sat here in the gallery and they looked down on the house floor and they thought golly where is everybody wheres everybody i thought it was going to be full of 435 members of congress but of course as you know in todays modern technology world everybodys back in their office watching things on television but i confess that sometimes during this morninghour i turn the volume down a little bit i turn it down a little bit because sometimes we get into those divisive issues down here on the house floor it gets my blood pressure up so much i think my head is going to explode first thing in the morning i sometimes turn the volume down but today i wanted to come down here and find those things that bring us together as opposed to divide us because i really do believe that as we face the kind of economic challenges that were facing in america today there is more that unites this body than divides it theres more that we can do together than we must fight about in order to move the american dream forward i have in my pocket a card its titled the house republican jobs plan but id tell you its an american jobs plan i look down the items that we have brought forward in this republican house americas house the things that theyve been able to pass in the united states senate those things that have gone to the presidents desk and we are making progress on those things that unite us of course we started the year off repealing the 1099 provision from the presidents health care bill that onerous provision that required new paperwork mandates on all of our small businesses completely unworkable we came together the house and senate and the president repealed that last week we came and we passed three new free trade agreementsthree new free trade agreementsfor this nation as you know with every nation that america has a free trade agreement we have a manufacturing surplus hear that with every nation with which we have a free trade agreement we have a manufacturing trade surplus we ship more americanmade goods to those countries than we import we have a trade deficit as a nation but a manufactured goods surplus with the nations with which we signed free trade agreements free trade agreements good for america good for jobs good for trade and we were able to move those across the presidents desk with his signature last week2 weeks ago now and this week were going to bring two more bills to the floor things that bring us together you heard my colleague from illinois talk about earlier this morning the 3 percent withholding a bill that we passed to say we think there are lots of tax cheats going on out there among folks who contract with the government so were going to just withhold those taxes up front and make you get them back later on well it turns out 3 percent withholding our small businesses owners didnt even have a 3 percent margin if we had held all that money they couldnt even pay the bills theyd actually have to operate at a loss for the year and ask the government in april for their refund the presidents onboard with that repeal i believe the house is going to be onboard with that repeal the senate is going to be onboard with that repeal were going to move that across the floor this week as well things that are bringing us together are common ground that we can cover to make it easier to create jobs in this country because i agree with my colleague mr rangel the american dream is that you can come here and do better tomorrow than you did today that you can provide your kids with more opportunity than what you had that is the american dream i dont worry that folks want to come to america i worry about the one day that that dream has disappeared and folks dont want to come to america anymore theyd rather take their big brain and their hard work ethic to china or to india or brazil or argentina we must preserve america as the magnet of success the magnet that attracts those that want to improve their lives and believe those opportunities exist here theres a commonality in all of those bills that weve passed and sent to the presidents desk this year and its that these were things the government did to try to encourage compliance to try to regulate to try to require that small businesses operate differently and what we found out is they didnt work the 1099 provision free trade those tariffs and duties that prevented that free trade this 3 percent holding provision what is the common ground mr speaker congress is doing too much in regulating america is doing too much in regulating this country i ran on that premise the challenge is we are not doing too little the problem is that we are doing too much and burdening those small businesses the former soviet bloc countries have learned from that example they have flat tax rates no exemptions no exceptions and their tax collections went up folks cant pay taxes if they dont have a job you cant pay income taxes if you dont have a job and you cant have a job if you dont have opportunity in your society the fair tax h r 25 goes right to the heart of these jobs issues repealing those burdensome taxes repealing those regulations and

from being enough excessive government spending has economic consequences for all americans higher costofliving higher interest rates higher taxes but we didnt get into this overnight and we will not

anniversary of the benghazi attack once again another anniversary has come and gone with no new answers about what happened that night or just what so many americans reportedly around two dozen were doing at a secret cia base in benghazi to begin with another anniversary has come and gone with no new public hearings by my count the last public hearing was held on september 18 nearly 3 months ago and no new public hearings are being held the keyword is public but perhaps most important another anniversary has come and gone with absolutely no one being held responsible for the security and intelligence failures leading up to the attack and no one has been brought to justice and despite several recent developments related to the benghazi investigation practically nothing has been done in congress to address them first we have recently learned that cia director john brennan distorted the facts in letters to the house intelligence committee and me when he claimed that benghazi survivors were not made to sign new nondisclosure agreements another major development is a november 24 article published by breitbart reporting surprising new comments by kevin kolbye the fbis lead investigator for benghazi who stated for the first time that the fbi arrived on the scene in benghazi within days not weeks of the attack according to the article by kerry picket the washington post reported that while the fbi had legats in algiers and cairo a team of fbi investigators could not get into benghazi 2 days after the attack kolbye disputes this we were there he said is agent kolbye correct was the fbi secretly on the ground in benghazi within days of the attack if so why is this being kept from the public once again the congress should know and to my knowledge has never asked agent kolbye to testify equally important why is it that we are learning additional comments before a paid audience of 400 a ticket you had to pay 400 to hear this guy speak but he has never spoken for free to the american people this is just like when the american people heard new information about that night from retired general ham when he appeared at a bigticket event in aspen the american people did not hear if you paid the money in aspen you got to hear i guess there was no need to tell the congress and the public what happened that night since paid audiences will hear through conferences through books and maybe even a movie finally i return to my concerns first raised on the house floor in july that the large cia base in benghazi may have been used to support covert operations with regard to syria including the possible transfer of weapons collected in libya to syrian rebels possibly in coordination with third parties of foreign countries particularly saudi arabia these concerns need to be addressed now more than ever after reports yesterday that both the unitedstates and the united kingdom have cut off support to rebels in northern syria along the turkish border after the islamic front a coalition of jihadi extremist fighters overran bases run by the free syrian army and seized their weapons and resources according to a report from the bbc yesterday the unitedstates and european countries have reportedly facilitated secret arms shipments to syrian rebels allegedly including antiaircraft weapons commonly referred to as manpads just like the weapons collected in libya over the last 2 years a separate washington post article stated a covert cia program providing lethal aid to the rebels consisting mostly of small arms and ammunition channeled to southern syria through jordan would continue unchanged it is particularly noteworthy that during the same period of time the cia was operating in benghazi and unitedstates weapons collection in libya were underway respected national security reporter mark hosenball wrote august 1 2012 president obama has signed a secret order authorizing unitedstates support for rebels seeking to depose syrian president bashar alassad and his government unitedstates sources familiar with the matter said obamas order approved earlier this year and known as an intelligence finding broadly permits the cia and other unitedstates agencies to provide support that could help the rebels oust assad hosenball continued a unitedstates government source acknowledged that under provisions of the presidential finding the united states was collaborating with a secret command center operated by turkey and its allies nbc said the shoulderfired missiles also known as manpads had been delivered to the rebels via turkey are these the same secret arms shipments that were just seized by the islamic extremists in northern syria have these weapons transferred with alleged unitedstates covert support been used to kill innocent civilians christians and muslims dont the american people have a right to know if their tax dollars are being spent to supply islamic extremists with weapons to use against christians and muslims we need a select committee the current process is not working it is time for the administration and the congress to say what the cia was doing in benghazi and elsewhere around syria a wall street journal article from august detailed just how closely saudi arabia was working with the cia to train and arm syrian rebels despite some concerns that the weapons could fall in the hands of the extremists it appears those concerns are coming true but the american people still arent being told the truth about the unitedstates role in arming the syrians and the role of the cia

comfort those who lost loved ones on 9 11 and asked that god would still bless america im grateful she did that other leaders did not andy mccarthyandrew mccarthywas the prosecutor of those who were involved in the 1993 world trade center bombing he is a man that understands the constitution he understands the law he is a fantastic prosecutor a brilliant mind and a great writer and i wont read the entire article but its an article worth noting from andrew c mccarthy entitled remembering 9 11 at least for a day he says it is difficult to say whats harder to believe that it has been 11 years since the 9 11 atrocities or that national security has become an irrelevant issue in the most consequential presidential election in decades the first observation reminds us that today is a day of remembrance of the loss of nearly 3 000 of our fellow citizens of the bravery of those who willingly gave their lives to save others and of the heroism of the men and women who put on the line all that they have that includes the love and wellbeing of their families on whom the burden of american national security has been imposed while the rest of us go on with our lives too often without giving them a first thought never mind a second no matter which political party has been in power since 9 11 there has been a great deal of bloviating about the rule of law it is as if we had evolved beyond anything so crude and benighted as armed force and national interest especially national defense lets remember today that we have the luxury of living under something resembling the rule of law only because dedicated americans sacrifice themselves to confront evil in this case the adherents of an evil ideology islamic supremacism that is closer to the law of the jungle and for those who do not understandim saying this parenthetically its not in the articleislamic supremacism is not talking about all of those who worship and follow islam and islamic teachings we have friends around the world who do not want to live under totalitarian radical islamic supremacism such as the taliban such as al qaeda they dont want to live under that and theyre muslims they want to live their lives they want to worship in their own religion without totalitarians telling them how they must unfortunately as in afghanistan those muslim friends and pakistan for that matter iran and iraq as well there are muslims who have admired the united states until we abandoned them going back to andrew mccarthys article the rule of law has precious little to do with why we have gotten through 11 years without a reprise of 9 11 a better explanation is that terrorists who have been captured or killed cannot commit more terrorism ill insert parenthetically there are terrorists who were captured some confined at guantanamo bay some confined at other facilities who have been released and who have been found again on the battlefield killing americans they were captured prevented from enacting further terrorism and then released under some false notion that that would win friends and influence people only to have other americans killed by these same thugs back to andrew mccarthys article he says on the matter of evil it is good to remember that it exists evil is not a misunderstanding a cultural gulf or a natural reaction to political policies adopted in pursuit of american interests or israeli selfdefense that brings us to the second observation the fact that national security concerns are absent from the 2012 campaign even with tens of thousands of americans at arms in distant hellholes even with tens of millions of americans enduring the increasingly overbearing government that has been the cost of heightened vigilance in an era where barbarism is met with political correctness the united states defeated the ideological threats of the 20th century because we were unafraid to see evil for what it wasto diagnose it and understand it today we ignore it rationalize it and assume we are somehow to blame for it for the bipartisan ruling class 9 11 is about violent extremism as if irrational wanton killers seized by a psychological disorder committed mass murder for no better reason than to visit on the worlds most famous office buildings the most shocking case of workplace violence in history the violent extremism narrative is nonsensical it defies reality as well as history but it is a convenient fiction it miniaturizes the enemy with the killing of bin laden the president can now portray the enemy as defeated even as al qaeda resurges even as iraq has become an iranianinfluenced sharia state that works against the united states and israel he says parenthetically remember when victory was defined as a stable democracy that is a reliable ally and even as afghan islamists turn their weapons on their american trainers and the administration pleads with the taliban to negotiate remember when victory was defined as a stable democracy that prevents the taliban from returning and giving safe haven to al qaeda again the violent extremism canard allows the administration to declare victory even as we are being humiliated thats an excerpt from andrew mccarthys article regarding today it is tragic that around the world the united states has had allies who trusted us who put their security in our hands even to the extent of losing political power losing political office like some of the polish leaders who trusted america to help them with a missile defense it wasnt as much a defense against russia it was concern for potential missiles in the middle east that this nation has not done enough to stop but those who staked their political careers on the trustworthiness of the united states came up empty in poland mubarak had agreements with this administration met with this administration qadhafi had agreements with this administration met with them talked we had senators from both sides of the aisle although one of our republican senators says he didnt send that message it wasnt his tweet he says now that he was meeting with qadhafi and that he was an interesting man but regardless we know that there were people from both sides of the aisle that went and met with qadhafi because qadhafi after president bush gave the order to invade iraq qadhafi believed he was next if he didnt do something and end his nuclear proliferation so he did he became an ally even though he was a murderer with blood on his hands he reached agreements he promised he would not attack americans again and once again someone who trusted agreement with the united states came up short some of our allies in other parts of the world and other countries have to be wondering if theyre next i visited with leaders in other countries who say the chinese are constantly coming around saying have you figured out yet that you cant really trust the united states to keep their agreements hey you can trust us well whenever you come around including in israel there are chinese constantly there saying when you figure out you cant trust the united states were ready to be your friend your ally there should be no better ally in the world than the united states but we have different administrations and different administrations are better about keeping their words with allies than others the northern alliance in afghanistan fought with us and for us to defeat the taliban by early 2002 over the years they have buried family and friends who have been our cofighters against radical islamists in afghanistan we abandoned them this administration did not want to talk to them and i was told by some of the northern alliance leaders earlier this year that one of the leaders of the taliban that this administration released for humanitarian purposes ended up announcing hes back leading the taliban as one of their leaders and he announced on afghan national television that under sharia law if anyone in afghanistan had not been supportive of the taliban in the past they need to come in and ask forgiveness and get the talibans protection because as the leader said told people who watched the national television channel in afghanistan that everybody in the world knows the united states has lost in afghanistan 1940 back to the article cnn says the film in question is a dutch production the ap says clips of the film are available on youtube show the prophet having sex and question his role as the messenger of gods words this would clearly be insulting having sexual relations it questions his role as a messenger of gods wordsof course that would be insulting its ridiculous to have anything that resembles that just as it is absolutely ridiculous and despicable to demean christianity to call it a hate group when its bounded by jesus who showed the ultimate love for all humanity its despicable when someone burns a flag but its not illegal its not illegal to burn a bible its despicable but its not illegal yet personally i anticipate if history shows what the radicals will do they will follow the example unfortunately there will be more rioting somebody will tragically be killed by these cutthroats then some will say see we need to change the law in america where you can burn bibles you can burn the flag you can desecrate any religionjust not islam then the goal as found in the archives after a search warrant showed one of the 10year goals to be subjecting our constitution to sharia law and that will be a box that can be checked off back to the article after the protest the unitedstates embassy issued this statement on its web site the embassy of the united states in cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of muslims as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions how about the christians in egypt that are being barbarically killed for their religious beliefs wouldnt it be nice if this administration would condemn those activities and do what it takes to stop them today the l1th anniversary of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of american democracy we firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others the grand mufti of egypt sheikh ali gomaa strongly condemned the movie freedom of speech does not warrant desecrating sanctities gomaa said in a statement sunday and hes right but those freedoms exist in america the old adage that was attributed to voltaire for most of the history since including during the revolutioni disagree with what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say itused to mean something in this country now its been subjected to ideological terms that would have it say more something on the order of i disagree with what you say so i want you imprisoned i want you to lose your business i want you to have no friends i want to take all your money i want to destroy your life what a turn over the last 200plus years from our constitutions establishment and writing in 1787 of course it took longer than that to be ratified eleven years after 9 11 what has gone wrong you know not only were there mistakes in vietnam under both democratic and republican presidents our embassy was attacked in tehran in 1979 those of us at fort benning i didnt know of anybody that was dying to go but i knew an awful lot of people willing to go and die in defense of our country under everybodys definition of international law when you attack an embassy you have attacked you have committed an act of war against that country if the host country cannot protect the embassy then that country who owns that embassy that uses that embassy has every right to bring the full military power to bear to defend it i still carry the horrible realization i believe if we had defended our embassy in 1979 thousands and thousands and thousands of precious americans would not have had to give their lives since our embassy has been attacked in egypt if the government that the secretary of state has promised 2 5 billioni dont know some of it may have already gone over thereif theyre not going to be able to defend our embassy then we need to take action to defend it i also think its time to revisit the carterera idea that we should never take out government leaders i think its time to have this debate again which is more immoral to go to war with a country where at the time you go to war most of the people of that country like you and respect you and yet are going to die many of them or to take a position look its your country youre free to establish whatever government you want but if you put in place a government that declares war on the united states that says we are the annihilation of the united states their way their people then we will take that government out and we wont rebuild it youll be free to pick whatever kind of government you want its time to have the debate wouldnt that have been better in afghanistan rather than forcing a centralized government on a tribal region that has since become so corrupt that the money that we have spent spent by the billions in afghanistan given to afghanistan has made its way to other places besides the intended objects talking to some of our soldiers over there who have trained farmers they said the billions that have been spent and sent to afghanistan to create farming projects had not any of it made it to the region where they were training the farmers it was wasted effort so they would travel around over there wondering will they be the next ied death or will they be the next ied dismemberment the thing is a good foreign policy says the enemy of our enemy is our friend a good foreign policy says we will not try to buy off the bullies in the world to make them like us as ive said for years you dont have to pay people to hate you theyll do it for free save that money use it to rebuild relations with former allies that have been let down but dont keep giving money to people who hate us we dont need to be nation building we need to let nations live in peace under their own discretion but if they declare war or set as a goal our annihilation shouldnt we at least talk about taking out the government rather than going to war with the people i think its time to have the debate again theres too much death and loss of life in afghanistan its hard to believe 70 percent of american lives lost in afghanistan of our military have occurred under commander obama eightyfour percent of all the wounded have been wounded under the command of commander obama its time to talk about these things whether the presidential candidates want to talk about them or not we owe that to the people we have put in harms way as this is the anniversary of 9 11 its another opportunity for me to recall the memory of ross mcginnis i hadnt gotten an email from tom asking me not to forget he knows i will never forget his son but i went to his funeral at arlington national cemetery i had become friends since then with the mcginnises i have been to all the funerals of those who have died while in service in harms way from my district i have been to too many of those such funerals but this wasnt a person from my district in east texas it was a guy from knox pennsylvania a young man who graduated from high school and gotten into trouble at the end rosss mom doesnt want me to forget that he was given a second chance they let him graduate he joined the army and ross found his niche i havent seen any pictures anybody had of me during officer basic training at fort riley kansas in 1974 but i dont think i was smiling if somebody has them it was a difficult time it was hot humid but there are pictures of ross going through basic with other soldiers and hes got a big old smile he had a beautiful smile and the guys with him are not so smiling there are pictures of him after he got to iraq and the heat was obviously wearing down his friends fellow servicemembers but he has a big old grin his platoon sergeant told me that he was such a piece of enthusiasm in their midst he was uplifting to the other soldiers ross was a gunner on a humvee and as it was going through a town whether shot or thrown a grenade goes into the bed of the humvee where there were four of our soldiers including rosss platoon sergeant from long view texas cedric thomas a soldier from tyler my hometown sean lawson and two other soldiers and they said that ross yelled grenade and he looked back but ross was the only one in a position to jump out and save himself but when he looked back and he saw each of the four cringing in their corners he obviously knew those four soldiers were going to die so instead of jumping out and saving his own life and four soldiers being lost he didnt jump out he jumped in he covered the grenade took the full blow himself gave his life and four of our soldiers are alive today because of what ross did just as on the statue downstairs right below me below where i stand the statue of father damien the catholic priest from hawaii on the side of it is john 15 13 the words greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends ross had a lot of love the accounts after 9 11 after those planes flew into buildings here at the pentagon there in new york those incredible heroes on the fourth flight that went down in a field in pennsylvania those heroes went running in willing to lay down their lives to save others as ross did there at arlington national cemetery the army chaplain did a wonderful job taps was played it always gets me it got everybody there a 21gun salute is an emotional thing at a funeral and as everyone stood to turn to go sergeant thomas came up knelt down before the remains of ross put his hand on the remains of ross mcginnis bowed his head in prayer he was followed by two others that ross had saved the fourth was still in iraq they put their hands on rosss remains bowed at the knee bowed in prayer and it was obvious what they were doing whether its on memorial day veterans day the 9 11 anniversary there cannot be too many occasions when we as a nation stop and do what those three soldiers did thank those who have laid down their lives for the rest of us for our liberties thank those who have sacrificed life or limb or suffered terrible disability for us and our lives and our liberty and then to thank god for people who are still willing to lay down their lives for us with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "13 adults and one unborn child were killed and 31 individuals were wounded in a shooting attack at fort hood texas on november 5 2009 since that time the department of defense has taken no steps to award combat benefits to the casualties or even officially recognize the attack as a terrorist incident the house and senate have included two reform measures in the ndaa which we just passed while additional attacks have been attempted by similar highprofile radical islamic terrorists it is past time for the government to deliver on this act here we are almost 3 years later and theres been a recent report that has come out and in that report it references this incident of this slaughter of american troops on fort hood soil in texas it references that it shall be taken up as part of workplace violence the obama regime calls the fort hood shooting workplace violence sure its workplace violence its where they work and its violence but we have a concept of what workplace violence is and your normal workplace violence is not preceded by a shout by the shooter god is great in the arabic language its not preceded by discussions by the alleged perpetrator its alleged because he hasnt been convicted yet and we in a free american world take the position that all are innocent until proven guilty so we will call him the alleged shooter but theres clear evidence in reports by the defense department and by reports by the news media reports by witnesses on the scene reports by his fellow soldiers reports by folks from walter reed hospital where this americantrained militarytrained doctor worked that he had advocated that the american soldier was wrong and that he was contrary and he spoke and preached islamic terrorism so your normal workplace violence thats not a part of the factor yet this is what happened in this case senator collins on wednesday blasted the defense department and bless her for it for classifying the fort hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nations armed forces at home ive been talking about this now since the day after this happened we cant have a world where political correctness fails to define the criminal act by its very nature whether were talking about military law and the criminal relations in military law were just talking about criminal acts in general we have to be able to define them just to make the system work we have to be able to define them but more importantly we owe a duty and a responsibility to the american soldier to call an event what it is and not try to put a smokescreen over it or cloud the issue or in any way worry about the feelings of groups because the definition is the definition this man identified himself that he was committing this act in the name of god is great in arabic he acknowledged when questioned that it was part of his mission he acknowledged that he had dealt with terrorist spokesmen in the past and that the concept came from his interaction with awlaki and others so this guy is an islamic terrorist theres no other way you can describe this gentleman but now years after the event as he sits in the bell county jail in belton texas we continue to have reports coming down from our defense department that the folks that are responsible for our soldiers and responsible for those who died in this incident want to downplay this to be treated as an incident of workplace violence with all the white bread connotation that that has to me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so lets look at some of the evidence we have that connects this to islamic terrorism recognizing the november 5 2009 attack on fort hood texas as an act of radical islamic terrorism and jihad anwar awlaki connection now mr awlaki is no longer with us we have taken that boy out yet the bottom line is at the time this happened they were directly connected this man preached taught and encouraged violenceislamic terrorist violence hasans presentations to the dod on jihad justification he would argue with his fellow soldiers about the justification for having jihad against the american military mr hasan was a member of the united states army he was a major he had been serving in the medical corps as a psychiatrist he was trained with american taxpayer dollars but he was preaching jihad to soldiers and there was lots of evidence i had a bill which was included in this recent defense bill that we just passed it said that this guy was telling people that hed believed in this kind of thing since medical school now hes a major serving as a psychiatrist advising our soldiers hasan purchased and practiced with highcapacity firearms prior to the attack he went out and he bought firearms he bought them at a local gun store of the guns that were used in the killings one of them was a semiautomatic weapon with a large magazine capacity he went out to the firing range and familiarized himself with these weapons prior to this incident you cant think of this as some guy who goes postal all of a sudden this guy was planning this whole event he shouts god is great in arabic before he starts shooting but they refer to it in the context of the broader threat of workplace violence i think there is a very good argument that the evidence shows this was a premeditated act on the part of major hasan and i believe when this case finally gets to trial that the evidence will be overwhelming that it was premeditated at the time of the event lieutenant general cone the iii corps commander at fort hood told nbcs today show on the friday after the shooting that the soldiers who witnessed the shooting rampage that left 13 people dead reported that the gunman shouted allahu akbar which means god is great before opening fire at the texas post the day after it was being reported that he did this yet in the initial report that came out from the defense department the mans name didnt even appear the relationship to any islamic terrorism was not referenced it was like any major from any outfit just wandered in and started shooting soldiers like he was having a bad day or something now we get another comment saying that were going to treat this in the bigger scope of workplace violence certainly we want to prevent workplace violence in every workplace but the connotation is that this is just something that happened its not something that just happened because quite honestly since that time others have been caught who reportedly were trying to imitate this shooter mr hasan we introduced a bill the fort hood families benefits protection act it would award both military and civilian casualties of the ford hood attack with combat status to ensure full benefits and eligibility for the purple heart and other awards and for the civilian award equivalence to the secretary of defenses defense of freedom medal now why did i ask for that because there was a precedent for it when they flew the plane into the pentagon on 9 11 this is what was the finding of the department of defensethat it was an act of terrorism and therefore they should be treated as combat casualties and those two medals were awarded this didnt just come off the top of my head this is what happened with the first terrorist attack in our country and with the second or third or whatever attack this one was when this man walked into that room there were people in civilian garb and there were people in uniform he went out of his way to shoot the people in uniform the civilians who were injured were injured because of misfire or misdirection as he walked down that line his target was all of those soldiers who were doing nothing more than either coming back from being off post and out of the countryor wherever theyd beenor preparing for their next duty stations wherever they may be goingiraq or afghanistan they were being processed and they were in this big room he walked down the line shooting everybody in uniform now when youre killing our combat soldiers and when youre crying out slogans of the jihad terrorists why wouldnt you think its a terrorist attack and why shouldnt these people who died in the line of duty be treated like those at the pentagon who died in the line of duty in fact except for what we were able to put together in circumstantial evidence after the fact at the time of the incident we had no idea who flew that plane into the pentagon we just made an educated guess in this case before this shooting started the guy identified himself and what his mission was for some reason in this world of political correctness someone has the idea that this is good for the morale of our military soldiers or that its good for something as i think the chief of staff said when this happened oh this is sure going to hurt our islamic outreach program whether its good for that or not i hold nothing against the islamic people nor does anybody at fort hood but we hold a lot against islamic terrorists who kill soldiers and the department of defense should have the guts to step up and to stand up for these soldiers i see my good
