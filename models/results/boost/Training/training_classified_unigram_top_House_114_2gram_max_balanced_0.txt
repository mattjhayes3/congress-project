in their health care and this bill ensures that adult patients struggling with mental illness will receive the healthcare treatment they need while allowing their families to become close partners in

10 years ago the scenes flashing across our television screens showed what appeared to be a third world countryliterally bodies floating in the streets people that were homeless homes washed awayone of the worst natural disasters in americas history over 1 200 of our brothers our sisters our mothers fathers uncles aunts our neighbors our friends perished in the disaster on august 29 2005 we lost over 1 200 people these vulnerabilities were not vulnerabilities that were unknown as a matter of fact mark schleifstein with the timespicayune published a series known as washing away in 2002 years before hurricane katrina hit our state and caused all this devastation that series accurately predicted the vulnerabilities accurately predicted the outcomes of a direct hit by a storm like hurricane katrina upon our communities we saw what had happened homes businesses monuments schools our history our dreams our hopes our future were all flooded as a result of hurricane katrina 10 years ago this wasnt a third world country it was one of americas great cities that was underwater many people look back at hurricane katrina and they view the impacts as being parochial things that impacted louisiana and mississippi and alabama not something that impacted the nation nothing could be further from the truth when the mississippi river was shut down and all the ports associated with it across the gulf coast as a result of the devastating impacts the farmers in the midwest had no way of getting their crops out to market there was no capacity within other transportation mediums to get these crops out therefore the farmers in the midwest suffered as a result of hurricane katrinas impacts on the gulf coast rail lines louisiana is only one of two places in the united states where we have all six class i rail lines in many cases the rail lines and the associated infrastructure was destroyed therefore once again severely impacting americas intermodal transportation system the economy one of the places that has these amazing natural resources has an amazing energy industry petrochemical industry agriculture industry and many many others severely impacted causing impacts not just again to the regional economy but to the national economy one great example of that is gasoline prices following hurricane katrina we watched gasoline prices spike 75 cents a gallon but let me be clear not in louisiana nationwide75 cents a gallon is the national average price increase as a result of those 2005 hurricanes on the gulf coast75 cents a gallon as i recall i believe that translates into 450 million in higher consumer payments per day as a result of the impacts those storms had the 2005 hurricaneshurricane katrina and hurricane ritahad on the gulf coast and had on really the nation importantly the deficit much of the recovery that was funded by the federal government in fact the far majority of it was funded by deficit spending funded by deficit spending this wasnt spending that was offset this wasnt reserve dollars that the federal government had sitting there waiting for this unbelievable disaster this was deficit spending our children our grandchildren our greatgrandchildren will be paying for decades for this i want to be clear this was preventable which i am going to talk about in a minute also the impact to the environment here you see the unitedstates army corps of engineers and you see the epa out there talking about the importance of wetlands and the importance of waters of the united states and writing all of these extraordinary rules to grant themselves more aggressive jurisdiction larger jurisdiction over our private lands yet as a result of those storms alone in 2005 we lost over 200 square miles of coastal wetlands in the state of louisiana alone i am going to say again a lot of people looked at this and watched it on tv and saw it as being a parochial problem a problem of the gulf coast a problem of louisiana mississippi and alabama you could cut and paste that situation you could paste virtually any other coastal city any other coastal state in this nation and they potentially could face the same repercussions the same outcomes as we experienced in 2005 because this nation continues to have a reactive policy to disasters and it is something that we have got to change we could have taken the hundredplus billion dollars that congress appropriated following the 2005 hurricanes to help recover to help get these communities back on their feet across the gulf coast we could have taken a fraction of those dollars and we could have invested it proactively and prevented it from happening any city on our coast could experience the same disaster we saw and i remind you just in 2012 we saw hurricane sandy cause profound consequences in new york new jersey and other communities on the east coast i will say it once again disasters that were preventable and so this is something that we all need to be paying attention to while in new orleans while in south louisiana and mississippi and in alabama there were amazing stories of communities coming together of people coming together of resilient families coming together to ensure that while this did knock them down they were getting back up again and they were going to recoverstrong resolve from these communities all across the gulf coast one other thing that was truly amazing is watching the incredible outpouring of support not just from the gulf coast but from all over this nation and countries around the world committing to come help us recover across the gulf coast it was an amazing opportunity for people to come together to put down differences and to all come together in support of the recovery of these communities the recovery of these families the recovery of these businesses the recovery of the hopes and dreams of these communities across the gulf coast we are going to continue to see this play over and over again we are going to continue to see these types of disasters over and over again until we turn the policies around in the united states until we see fundamental changes i want to pivot back to the recovery i want to pivot back to new orleans i want to pivot back to plaquemines parish and st bernard st tammany i want to pivot back to lower jefferson parish these communities in many cases were destroyed everything was underwater everything i will say it again the homes the businesses the schools the hopes the dreams the future underwaterand 10 years ago 10 years ago unbelievable i think that most people would have told you these communities arent coming back they cant come back they have been so profoundly impacted that they simply cant recover from this but that is not what happened as you just heard mr scalise discuss people came together we now have an amazing progress amazing recovery of our schools in south louisiana amazing recovery in our economy as a matter of fact we now have tens of billions of dollars in economic development projects on the horizon while in other areas you are seeing people losing jobs you are seeing businesses close you are seeing small businesses shut down and a trend of more small businesses closing and opening across the nation but in louisiana tens of billions of dollars in new economic development projects on the horizon as a matter of fact we have the largest foreign investment in unitedstates history committed to projects in south louisiana we are seeing a manufacturing renaissance and it is happening because our people are so resilient because we have come back because we have come together and because we have plotted a path to the future using the resources that louisiana is so blessed with the louisiana maritime transportation system that we have and the amazing natural resources in regard to the inexpensive readily available natural gas oil petrochemical industry the rail lines the intermodal transportation facilities we have been able to accomplish a manufacturing renaissance not in mexico not in asia but right here in the united states in south louisiana in closing i want to say i pray that there is not another community that there is not another city that there is not another state in this nation that has to experience that has to go through the tragedy the travesty that we experienced in south louisiana the loss of over 1 200 of our friends our relatives and our neighbors to see the type of recovery to see people come together to see us finally help to build a resilient protection system resilient ecosystem to ensure that the next storm isnt going to cause the same devastation to new orleans as we saw 10 years ago i pray that that doesnt have to happen again the only way we prevent it from happening again is if people learn from the lessons of hurricane katrina from hurricane rita if they actually apply the lessons learned that we so painfully went through in south louisiana in mississippi and in alabama that we apply those lessons around the united states to make our communities more resilient to make our economy more resilient to make our businesses more resilient to make our families more resilient and most importantly to ensure that we can all accomplish the american dream i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "15 years ago this september 11th our

majority leader and the minority leader i want to start with a phrase i often share with my fellow members in a negotiation you are always going to get less than you want and give up more than you would like i think that is a fitting way to describe the bill we find ourselves presented with today in an era of divided government that is the reality we find ourselves in at the beginning of the negotiation the president demanded a clean debt ceiling increase with no changes and no conditions in addition he wanted more spending and higher taxes given that i think the deal that we have before us is a testament to our leaderships ability to negotiate as i said yesterday nobody is going to be popping champagne corks at either end of pennsylvania avenue over this bill it is what most things are in divided government in a system of checks and balances and in an era of polarized politics it is a deal that leaves both sides unsatisfied but it is a deal that avoids default prevents a government shutdown and adequately funds our military moreover it reforms and funds the social security disability insurance fund saving it from bankruptcy and prevents a crippling increase in the premiums paid by many people who receive medicare part b there are any number of provisions that members on both sides can point to as reasons to oppose this legislation i myself would have negotiated a different deal but in determining ones support for this legislation i encourage members to look at what the alternative would be and that is this the first default on our nations debt in the history of this country significant cuts to our military in a time when we need our military the most and an almost 50 percent increase in medicare premiums for many of our seniors that is the reality of what happens if we do nothing i am encouraged by a number of provisions in this legislation first just like the bipartisan budget act of 2013 this legislation sets forth 2 years of budget certainty for the appropriations committee that certainty puts us on a path to ensure consideration of fullyear spending bills for the next 2 years just as we were able to accomplish this past fiscal year in addition this budget certainty provides the needed investment for our military with the ongoing conflicts across the middle east russian activity in eastern europe and chinese claims in the south china sea it is clearer now than ever that america needs a robust military most importantly all these discretionary spending increases are fully paid for by offsets in mandatory programs in addition to these critical investments the legislation before us makes a number of commonsense structural reforms to ssdi like requiring a medical review before awarding benefits and expanding cooperative disability investigations units to investigate sophisticated fraud schemes before benefits are awarded these reforms both ensure that the disability trust fund will be able to pay full benefits and ensure that those who truly are disabled have access to this important program beyond that this legislation realizes over 30 billion in medicare savings within the budget window and countless billions in years to come i am pleased to again be talking about the real drivers of our debt the twothirds of our government spending that is on autopilot if we are unable to deal with these mandatory programs they will end up bankrupting us finally this legislation suspends the debt ceiling through march 15 2017 since its inception in 1917 20 debt limit laws also included a change in fiscal policy i am pleased that this debt limit increase is yet again accompanied by mandatory reforms of course i would have preferred stronger reforms but in this era of divided government with a democratic president and a republican congress no one will be able to get everything they want the president wanted a clean debt limit increase congress wanted significant entitlement reforms what we are left with is a

habitat perhaps more importantly they serve as economic engines for the surrounding local communities our national forests are capable of providing and sustaining these economic benefits but they need

knows exactly how many the justice department and the american bar association each tried to identify every crime and failed mr larkin continued no reasonable person not even a judge or lawyer could possibly know all of these legal prohibitions although criminal penalties are attached to each john baker a retired louisiana state university law professor said there is no one in the united states over the age of 18 who cannot be indicted for some federal crime he added that is not an exaggeration i have special interests in this because for 712 years before coming to congress i was a criminal court judge in tennessee trying the felony criminal cases i believe in being tough on crime and i have been a very strong supporter of local law enforcement the people on the front lines who are fighting the real crime the violent crime that everyone is so concerned about i remember in 1993 reading an article in forbes magazine one of the nations most conservative magazines this article said that we had quadrupled the justice department just between 1980 and 1993 and that federal prosecutors were falling all over themselves trying to find cases to prosecute we have kept on expanding the justice department since then and have had explosive growth in the number of federal crimes we have had far too many cases where overzealous prosecutors have prosecuted highprofile defendants just so that a prosecutor could make a name for himself i remember the totally unjustified case against secretary of labor ray donovan in which after he was acquitted made the famous statement where do i go to get my reputation back our federal government has become far too big and it is far too powerful we all have heard how particularly the irs is running roughshod over individual citizens newsweek magazine a few years had on its cover inside the irslawless abusive and out of control unfortunately while there are many good federal prosecutors there are far too many of them and unfortunately some who like the irs are lawless abusive and out of control there are now so many laws rules and regulations on the books today that people are being prosecuted for violating laws they didnt even know were in existence paul larkin whom i quoted earlier said that we need a mistake of law defense an innocent mistake is not supposed to be criminal but a zealous prosecutor can make even an innocent mistake look criminal and there is an old saying that a prosecutor could indict a ham sandwich if he wanted to almost everyone has violated some tax lawthey are so convoluted and confusingand almost every person in any type of business has unknowingly violated some law rule or regulation for which they could be prosecuted that is why yesterday we had at our hearing a conservative republican like senator john cornyn a former justice of the texas supreme court and senator cory booker a liberal democrat and a conservative like representative sensenbrenner and a liberal like representative bobby scottall joining together to urge reform lastly let me mention one other aspect of our nations crime problem in my years as a judge i handled over 10 000 cases because probably 97 or 98 percent of the defendants enter some type of guilty plea and then apply for probation every day for 71 2 years i would read several 8 or 10page reports into a defendants background and i would read defendants father left home when defendant was 2 and never returned or defendants father left home to get a pack of cigarettes and never came back over 90 percent of the defendants in felony cases in my court came from fatherabsent households drugs and or alcohol are involved in most cases but they are secondary to the absent father problem years ago i read a report that said 57 percent of marriages break up in arguments disputes or disagreements about money as government has grown so much at all levels federal state and local over the past 40 or 50 years it has become a major factor in the breakup of the

bodies floating in the streets people that were homeless homes washed awayone of the worst natural disasters in americas history over 1 200 of our brothers our sisters our mothers fathers uncles aunts our neighbors our friends perished in the disaster on august 29 2005 we lost over 1 200 people these vulnerabilities were not vulnerabilities that were unknown as a matter of fact mark schleifstein with the timespicayune published a series known as washing away in 2002 years before hurricane katrina hit our state and caused all this devastation that series accurately predicted the vulnerabilities accurately predicted the outcomes of a direct hit by a storm like hurricane katrina upon our communities we saw what had happened homes businesses monuments schools our history our dreams our hopes our future were all flooded as a result of hurricane katrina 10 years ago this wasnt a third world country it was one of americas great cities that was underwater many people look back at hurricane katrina and they view the impacts as being parochial things that impacted louisiana and mississippi and alabama not something that impacted the nation nothing could be further from the truth when the mississippi river was shut down and all the ports associated with it across the gulf coast as a result of the devastating impacts the farmers in the midwest had no way of getting their crops out to market there was no capacity within other transportation mediums to get these crops out therefore the farmers in the midwest suffered as a result of hurricane katrinas impacts on the gulf coast rail lines louisiana is only one of two places in the united states where we have all six class i rail lines in many cases the rail lines and the associated infrastructure was destroyed therefore once again severely impacting americas intermodal transportation system the economy one of the places that has these amazing natural resources has an amazing energy industry petrochemical industry agriculture industry and many many others severely impacted causing impacts not just again to the regional economy but to the national economy one great example of that is gasoline prices following hurricane katrina we watched gasoline prices spike 75 cents a gallon but let me be clear not in louisiana nationwide75 cents a gallon is the national average price increase as a result of those 2005 hurricanes on the gulf coast75 cents a gallon as i recall i believe that translates into 450 million in higher consumer payments per day as a result of the impacts those storms had the 2005 hurricaneshurricane katrina and hurricane ritahad on the gulf coast and had on really the nation importantly the deficit much of the recovery that was funded by the federal government in fact the far majority of it was funded by deficit spending funded by deficit spending this wasnt spending that was offset this wasnt reserve dollars that the federal government had sitting there waiting for this unbelievable disaster this was deficit spending our children our grandchildren our greatgrandchildren will be paying for decades for this i want to be clear this was preventable which i am going to talk about in a minute also the impact to the environment here you see the unitedstates army corps of engineers and you see the epa out there talking about the importance of wetlands and the importance of waters of the united states and writing all of these extraordinary rules to grant themselves more aggressive jurisdiction larger jurisdiction over our private lands yet as a result of those storms alone in 2005 we lost over 200 square miles of coastal wetlands in the state of louisiana alone i am going to say again a lot of people looked at this and watched it on tv and saw it as being a parochial problem a problem of the gulf coast a problem of louisiana mississippi and alabama you could cut and paste that situation you could paste virtually any other coastal city any other coastal state in this nation and they potentially could face the same repercussions the same outcomes as we experienced in 2005 because this nation continues to have a reactive policy to disasters and it is something that we have got to change we could have taken the hundredplus billion dollars that congress appropriated following the 2005 hurricanes to help recover to help get these communities back on their feet across the gulf coast we could have taken a fraction of those dollars and we could have invested it proactively and prevented it from happening any city on our coast could experience the same disaster we saw and i remind you just in 2012 we saw hurricane sandy cause profound consequences in new york new jersey and other communities on the east coast i will say it once again disasters that were preventable and so this is something that we all need to be paying attention to while in new orleans while in south louisiana and mississippi and in alabama there were amazing stories of communities coming together of people coming together of resilient families coming together to ensure that while this did knock them down they were getting back up again and they were going to recoverstrong resolve from these communities all across the gulf coast one other thing that was truly amazing is watching the incredible outpouring of support not just from the gulf coast but from all over this nation and countries around the world committing to come help us recover across the gulf coast it was an amazing opportunity for people to come together to put down differences and to all come together in support of the recovery of these communities the recovery of these families the recovery of these businesses the recovery of the hopes and dreams of these communities across the gulf coast we are going to continue to see this play over and over again we are going to continue to see these types of disasters over and over again until we turn the policies around in the united states until we see fundamental changes i want to pivot back to the recovery i want to pivot back to new orleans i want to pivot back to plaquemines parish and st bernard st tammany i want to pivot back to lower jefferson parish these communities in many cases were destroyed everything was underwater everything i will say it again the homes the businesses the schools the hopes the dreams the future underwaterand 10 years ago 10 years ago unbelievable i think that most people would have told you these communities arent coming back they cant come back they have been so profoundly impacted that they simply cant recover from this but that is not what happened as you just heard mr scalise discuss people came together we now have an amazing progress amazing recovery of our schools in south louisiana amazing recovery in our economy as a matter of fact we now have tens of billions of dollars in economic development projects on the horizon while in other areas you are seeing people losing jobs you are seeing businesses close you are seeing small businesses shut down and a trend of more small businesses closing and opening across the nation but in louisiana tens of billions of dollars in new economic development projects on the horizon as a matter of fact we have the largest foreign investment in unitedstates history committed to projects in south louisiana we are seeing a manufacturing renaissance and it is happening because our people are so resilient because we have come back because we have come together and because we have plotted a path to the future using the resources that louisiana is so blessed with the louisiana maritime transportation system that we have and the amazing natural resources in regard to the inexpensive readily available natural gas oil petrochemical industry the rail lines the intermodal transportation facilities we have been able to accomplish a manufacturing renaissance not in mexico not in asia but right here in the united states in south louisiana in closing i want to say i pray that there is not another community that there is not another city that there is not another state in this nation that has to experience that has to go through the tragedy the travesty that we experienced in south louisiana the loss of over 1 200 of our friends our relatives and our neighbors to see the type of recovery to see people come together to see us finally help to build a resilient protection system resilient ecosystem to ensure that the next storm isnt going to cause the same devastation to new orleans as we saw 10 years ago i pray that that doesnt have to happen again the only way we prevent it from happening again is if people learn from the lessons of hurricane katrina from hurricane rita if they actually apply the lessons learned that we so painfully went through in south louisiana in mississippi and in alabama that we apply those lessons around the united states to make our communities more resilient to make our economy more resilient to make our businesses more resilient to make our families more resilient and most importantly to ensure that we can all accomplish the american dream i
