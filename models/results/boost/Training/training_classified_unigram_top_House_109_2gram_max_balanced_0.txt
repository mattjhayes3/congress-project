the other little boy was digging around happy as a lark and they asked him why are you so happy and he said with all of this horse manure in here there has got to be a pony here somewhere the reason

counted by iraqis and the 275 members of this new parliament will all be iraqis i believe the united states made a sound decision in helping start this democracy similar to the events following world war ii when america launched democracies in the nations of our enemies japan and germany the skeptics and critics said it could not be done and those skeptics and critics are still around today but todbay japan and germany are not only thriving democracies but they are also world economic powers and they are our allies so this too will be our hope and desire for iraq and for afghanistan these two nations will become democracies in spite of the hardships and detractors here at home and abroad those people who utter words of gloom doom and despair history will prove those people wrong history corroborates that freedom can grow in the desert of oppression our efforts have not gone without appreciation by the iraqi people the individuals i spoke to on that sunday morning and afternoon said they love americans especially our military they are truly grateful as election day drew to a close on sunday afternoon the gentleman from connecticut and i spoke with the president of iraq and in an almost emotional tone he told us that the iraqi people recognize that america has sacrificed their young men and women for iraq for this day to come we should be happy for the iraqi people and proud that we have sown the seed of freedom in this land far far away and we must remember the words 40 years ago of a young man from massachusetts president john kennedy when he stated our commitment then and our commitment today he said let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe
