washington at its worst disguised as an ethics reform for congress why do i say this i say it because there are a number of provisions in the bill that pa t so much control over private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up to 10 000 and could be as mnh as 200 09 now the gentleman there said the ethics rules in this house would penalize a member of this house in the event that they broke the law that is in this bill i would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine now we talk about the pac contributions the gentleman from texas the sponsor of this bill from april 9 of this year to june 20 got 76 percent of his campaign contributions from pacs 42 500 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say that it would probably have nore of an impact on him than a big mac that he is getting from the same people who are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind of ethics

days ago i took a 5minute special order in order to discuss the forthcoming elections in mexico with my colleagues considering all the critical issues that we are dealing with here i know it is very hard for us to turn our attention to something which seems as remote as that and far removed from our own domestic policy concerns as well as our own domestic political concerns but i want to take this 5 minutes just to continue to share a few observations based on my visit to mexico this past weekend where i had an opportunity to meet with election officials as well as political party individuals and to see some of the work that is going on with regard to this election because i think this election is not only as i said 2 days ago the most important in mexicos history this election may also be one of the most important for the united states for our foreign policy in latin america and certainly for our relationship with mexico it is my view that the government of mexico has done everything that is conceivable to try to ensure a fair and open and free election one that is devoid of the kind of manipulation that has characterized past elections in mexico that is not to say that there will not be inequities in the election that there would not be things that would be characterized as illegalities or unusual procedures but i believe that at the level of the government of mexico every effort is being made to minimize those and to assure that that does not occur but an election as we know consists of thousands and tens of thousands of people all over the country manning polling booths from the large cities to the small communities in that country as well as it would in this country so some of inequalities and the illegal procedures that may creep in may be done at a very local level what is the outlook for this election there are three major candidates and four others who are minor candidates who are running the three major candidates represent the party of the government the pri they represent the traditionally conservative marketoriented party called the pan and the leftwing or more liberal party the prd the pri has not lost an election since 1927 when it was formed it is likely this time in my judgment to come out on top with the vote but probably for the first time in its history without a majority obviously i cannot say my judgment is only based on conversations and polling data that i have seen not on anything else that i could judge but i believe that it is likely that we will see a victory by a plurality perhaps for the pri but with very close following by both the pan and the prd that is going to mean a very major change in the politics within the country of mexico because it will mean that this government for the first time cannot claim to have the mandate of the majority of the people of mexico we have had that historically in our country in many many elections and of course our current president was elected with considerably less than 50 percent of the electorate but that does not mean he cannot govern and it does not mean that the president of mexico would not be able to govern but it does mean reaching a different kind of consensus than has been done in the past in order to achieve a government that can work effectively with minority parties i believe that these elections are of enormous importance to mexico as they proceed with the transformation of their country to a democracy the changes that have taken place in mexico under president salinas have been enormous but they have been largely geared toward economic reform now we are seeing the next step even as i argued the other day in the china mfn debate that increased trade and increased economic activity will lead to increased political freedom that is exactly what we are seeing in mexico so i want to urge my colleagues as we finish up our work around here for the month of august before we go home to try to keep some of their attention on this absolutely critical election for our neighbor to the south of us a neighbor with a rapidly growing economy a neighbor with 85 million people in it a neighbor which is vital to our own interests in

tonight because i feel very strongly about what happened i would like to read the newspaper article and then make a couple of comments about it the article was in the washington post and this is what the article had to say and i quote a unitedstates coast guard prayer breakfast scheduled for tuesday was canceled this week after rep gerry e studds dmass who is openly gay and chairs the committee that oversees the coast guard complained about the featured speaker a conservative who has spoken widely against lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military gary l bauer a former domestic policy adviser in the reagan white house and head of the family research council said he had been scheduled for more than six months to deliver an address on balancing work and family life but was informed a few days ago that the breakfast had been canceled yesterday bauer sent a letter to studds charging him with pressuring the coast guard to cancel the address i am utterly amazed that a member of congress would abuse his power to suppress free speech rights bauer wrote he said in a telephone interview that he believed studds had threatened coast guard officials over bauers presence at the event i cant help but believe that since in recent weeks i have criticized the presidents idea about changing military rules on how homosexuality is treated that i have stepped on the lifestyle of the congressman bauer said studds could not be reached for comment but a spokesman said the allegation that studds threatened coast guard officials was ridiculous now this next paragraph is of great concern to me it says spokesman steve schwadron said studds called adm j william klime commandant of the coast guard earlier this week to raise concerns about the invitation to bauer it seemed odd to mr studds that mr bauer would be asked to address an observance like this it didnt seem in a common sense fashion to be a pulpit for a rightwing ideologue to vent his political agenda schwadron said the decision to cancel the session was made independently by kime rep w j billy tauzin dla who heads the merchant marine and fisheries coast guard and navigation subcommittee said studdss call to kime also was meant to alert him that a coast guard electronic message system was being used to organize opposition to president clintons lifting of the militarys gay ban it was the commandants own decision to take the steps he took in ordering the breakfast canceled and use of the electronic message system for that purpose stopped he said he said kime was not aware before studdss call about the use of the message system or bauers political views or his scheduled talk coast guard spokesman capt ernest blanchard said the breakfast was canceled because there were some concerns from members of the command that all religious affiliations were not represented blanchard said he had no knowledge of any involvement in the decision by studds now the fact of the matter is congressman studds my colleague who has had some problems in this body i believe he was censured a few years ago for homosexual involvement with one of our pages called the coast guard commandant and complained that mr bauer wouldmr bauer incidentally is a christian spokesman who speaks around the country on family values and the purpose of his speech to the coast guard was to address on balancing work and family life and had absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality in fact this had been planned for 6 months long before the issue of homosexuals being admitted into the military had even been raised by the clinton administration so my concern is that free speech was impeded that there was an implied threat or the possibility of an implied threat by virtue of this phone call by congressman studds to the coast guard and i think it is very unfortunate that this occurred this issue of homosexuality homosexuals being admitted into the military is one that has not yet been decided by the congress of the united states in fact the president has agreed to postpone action on this for the next 4 or 5 months at that time we will have an up or down vote on it i am confident in the congress but to stop somebody who is going to be talking about family values and balancing work and family values from speaking to the coast guard at a prayer breakfast simply because he differs with congressman stfdds on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed in the military is a gross violation in my opinion of constitutional rights the coast guard obviously wanted gary bauer to speak they obviously wanted him to speak at the prayer breakfast it had been organized for 6 months and it was stopped simply because mr bauer had taken issue with the congressmans position i think it is a mistake i think it should not have happended i think it is very unfortunate i would just like to urge my colleagues to think long and hard before they start interfering with the coast guards right to have anyone they want to

state law and will monitor sexually violent predatorsincluding those convicted of stalkingwherever theymay locate once they are released from prison even if they move across state lines washington state leads the nation in coping with this small group of criminals who terrorize primarily women in their neighborhoods homes and workplaces when rapists womenbeaters or convicted violent stalkers are released into the community the women in that community have a right to know in fact the washington state supreme court already has ruled that this type of law is constitutional already both the house and senate have passed legislation that requires law enforcement officials to notify communities when child molesters and others who pose a threat to children are released that is right and good a warning that society owes to parents and their children in the same way our society owes to its women some notification that a predator is being released and law enforcement officials should be encouraged to track their movements just as they do for those who have committed crimes against children by contrast the language that is being proposed in the conference report unacceptably weakens community notification and instead protects the rights of criminals lawabiding citizens especially women have a right to know when a predator is being released into their community what is the point of registering and tracking these convicted predators if we are not going to share that information with the very citizens who are at risk how can we justify knowing where a sexual predator has located and not notify the women and families in that neighborhood especially when so many of them move across state lines to settle next door to one of our constituents the rate of recidivism for these crimes is astronomical because these people are compulsive we know that and that is why it is incumbent upon us to ensure that community notification is encouraged without the community notification the effort is reduced to the simple collection of data i would hope the house would recognize this fact and open up the conference report to strengthen this important language the next

would come tumbling down now the east berlin i saw that day was supposed to be the garden spot of communism if you were a good communist all of your life your reward was a week in east berlin garden spot it was the most depraved slum i have ever seen a shoe store had eight pairs of shoes and they were all on display in their store front window a liquor store had an inventory of three bottles of something probably vodka but whatever it was it was oozing out of the top of the bottles eighteen months later i returned to east berlin i could not believe it was the same city it was vibrant bustling and full of activity and commerce it was indescribable what 18 months of freedom had done a transformation had taken place a comparable transformation has taken place in china i traveled from hong kong up through the southern province of guangdong everywhere i looked there was activity and commerce the infrastructure had not kept up with commercial growth it reminded me of the early part of the industrial revolution of the united states in guangdong province alone there were 7 000 factories not too long ago there were virtually none they were importing goods from most every country i witnessed what is becoming the largest market in the world upon returning to oklahoma i found out that my state is supplying many of their imports the largest industry in my district is transportation specifically aerospace and aviation china is the largest potential market for the aerospace industry upon checking with the chamber of commerce and numerous business leaders in the community i was shocked and pleased to learn how many firms large and small in my district were exporting to china both in the areas of aerospace and products produced for oil field related activities some of those companies arerockwell international flight safety international mcdonnell douglas corp nordam burtek and eg g chandler engineering just to name a few we can continue the growth of this great export market all we have to do is treat them like everybody else we shouldnt be calling our relationship mostfavorednation status that is a misnomer what we are discussing today is the question should we single out china from all our other trading partners so that we can discriminate against them we share mfn status with spain france germany the united kingdom ireland sweden finland denmark poland egypt morocco mall algeria saudi arabia and most other countries so if we deny mfn status to c hina we are telling the fastest growing market in the world that we dont want to do business with them what does this have to do with human rights which seems to dominate the mfn issue very little in fact we shouldnt be debating both issues at the same time or on the same day we have everything to lose and nothing to gain are we so arrogant to think that we are the only market for chinas booming economy right now the chinese are buying 76 percent of their airlines from mcdonnell douglas and boeing do we somehow believe that they arent going to buy from airbus sure they are and that means hundreds of jobs in tulsa ok and i suspect in all the rest of the districts represented here today do we not believe that china will retaliate against us if we try to tie the two issues of trade and human rights together you bet they will in 1992 new china air deliberately dropped a deal with airbus after france agreed to sell taiwan 50 mirage fighters am i somehow selfserving on this issue sure mcdonnell douglas is estimating 175 sales to china over the next few years a lot of them will be made in tulsa boeing has signed a deal with china for 20 737s 1 757 and 6 777s and boeing buys its control surfaces skin and many other components from rockwell in tulsa so you might say that i have changed my position of tying together trade and human rights in years past i have consistently tied the two together i have tried to believe that we can force china into submission with mfn status that we are so important and valuable that china cant get along without us that we should impose our social and cultural standards upon china before we allow them to become our major export market that we can tell a country that represents onethird of the world that we dont want to do business with them and somehow come out ahead i really tried to believe that but when i return to oklahoma as i do each weekend and see the layoffs the struggling companies and industries trying to survive a sober reality sets in maybe just maybe we need china more than china needs us no one in this institution abhors human rights violations more than i do i have fought against such violations all the way from nicaragua to siberia and will continue to do so but what about the human rights of our workers here in the

big brotherism from washington at its worst disguised as an ethics reform for congress why do i say this i say it because there are a number of provisions in the bill that pa t so much control over private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up to 10 000 and could be as mnh as 200 09 now the gentleman there said the ethics rules in this house would penalize a member of this house in the event that they broke the law that is in this bill i would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine now we talk about the pac contributions the gentleman from texas the sponsor of this bill from april 9 of this year to june 20 got 76 percent of his campaign contributions from pacs 42 500 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say that it would probably have nore of an impact on him than a big mac that he is getting from the same people who are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind

it is very hard for us to turn our attention to something which seems as remote as that and far removed from our own domestic policy concerns as well as our own domestic political concerns but i want to take this 5 minutes just to continue to share a few observations based on my visit to mexico this past weekend where i had an opportunity to meet with election officials as well as political party individuals and to see some of the work that is going on with regard to this election because i think this election is not only as i said 2 days ago the most important in mexicos history this election may also be one of the most important for the united states for our foreign policy in latin america and certainly for our relationship with mexico it is my view that the government of mexico has done everything that is conceivable to try to ensure a fair and open and free election one that is devoid of the kind of manipulation that has characterized past elections in mexico that is not to say that there will not be inequities in the election that there would not be things that would be characterized as illegalities or unusual procedures but i believe that at the level of the government of mexico every effort is being made to minimize those and to assure that that does not occur but an election as we know consists of thousands and tens of thousands of people all over the country manning polling booths from the large cities to the small communities in that country as well as it would in this country so some of inequalities and the illegal procedures that may creep in may be done at a very local level what is the outlook for this election there are three major candidates and four others who are minor candidates who are running the three major candidates represent the party of the government the pri they represent the traditionally conservative marketoriented party called the pan and the leftwing or more liberal party the prd the pri has not lost an election since 1927 when it was formed it is likely this time in my judgment to come out on top with the vote but probably for the first time in its history without a majority obviously i cannot say my judgment is only based on conversations and polling data that i have seen not on anything else that i could judge but i believe that it is likely that we will see a victory by a plurality perhaps for the pri but with very close following by both the pan and the prd that is going to mean a very major change in the politics within the country of mexico because it will mean that this government for the first time cannot claim to have the mandate of the majority of the people of mexico we have had that historically in our country in many many elections and of course our current president was elected with considerably less than 50 percent of the electorate but that does not mean he cannot govern and it does not mean that the president of mexico would not be able to govern but it does mean reaching a different kind of consensus than has been done in the past in order to achieve a government that can work effectively with minority parties i believe that these elections are of enormous importance to mexico as they proceed with the transformation of their country to a democracy the changes that have taken place in mexico under president salinas have been enormous but they have been largely geared toward economic reform now we are seeing the next step even as i argued the other day in the china mfn debate that increased trade and increased economic activity will lead to increased political freedom that is exactly what we are seeing in mexico so i want to urge my colleagues as we finish up our work around here for the month of august before we go home to try to keep some of their attention on this absolutely critical election for our neighbor to the south of us a neighbor with a rapidly growing economy a neighbor with 85 million people in it a neighbor which is vital to our own interests in

tonight because i feel very strongly about what happened i would like to read the newspaper article and then make a couple of comments about it the article was in the washington post and this is what the article had to say and i quote a unitedstates coast guard prayer breakfast scheduled for tuesday was canceled this week after rep gerry e studds dmass who is openly gay and chairs the committee that oversees the coast guard complained about the featured speaker a conservative who has spoken widely against lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military gary l bauer a former domestic policy adviser in the reagan white house and head of the family research council said he had been scheduled for more than six months to deliver an address on balancing work and family life but was informed a few days ago that the breakfast had been canceled yesterday bauer sent a letter to studds charging him with pressuring the coast guard to cancel the address i am utterly amazed that a member of congress would abuse his power to suppress free speech rights bauer wrote he said in a telephone interview that he believed studds had threatened coast guard officials over bauers presence at the event i cant help but believe that since in recent weeks i have criticized the presidents idea about changing military rules on how homosexuality is treated that i have stepped on the lifestyle of the congressman bauer said studds could not be reached for comment but a spokesman said the allegation that studds threatened coast guard officials was ridiculous now this next paragraph is of great concern to me it says spokesman steve schwadron said studds called adm j william klime commandant of the coast guard earlier this week to raise concerns about the invitation to bauer it seemed odd to mr studds that mr bauer would be asked to address an observance like this it didnt seem in a common sense fashion to be a pulpit for a rightwing ideologue to vent his political agenda schwadron said the decision to cancel the session was made independently by kime rep w j billy tauzin dla who heads the merchant marine and fisheries coast guard and navigation subcommittee said studdss call to kime also was meant to alert him that a coast guard electronic message system was being used to organize opposition to president clintons lifting of the militarys gay ban it was the commandants own decision to take the steps he took in ordering the breakfast canceled and use of the electronic message system for that purpose stopped he said he said kime was not aware before studdss call about the use of the message system or bauers political views or his scheduled talk coast guard spokesman capt ernest blanchard said the breakfast was canceled because there were some concerns from members of the command that all religious affiliations were not represented blanchard said he had no knowledge of any involvement in the decision by studds now the fact of the matter is congressman studds my colleague who has had some problems in this body i believe he was censured a few years ago for homosexual involvement with one of our pages called the coast guard commandant and complained that mr bauer wouldmr bauer incidentally is a christian spokesman who speaks around the country on family values and the purpose of his speech to the coast guard was to address on balancing work and family life and had absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality in fact this had been planned for 6 months long before the issue of homosexuals being admitted into the military had even been raised by the clinton administration so my concern is that free speech was impeded that there was an implied threat or the possibility of an implied threat by virtue of this phone call by congressman studds to the coast guard and i think it is very unfortunate that this occurred this issue of homosexuality homosexuals being admitted into the military is one that has not yet been decided by the congress of the united states in fact the president has agreed to postpone action on this for the next 4 or 5 months at that time we will have an up or down vote on it i am confident in the congress but to stop somebody who is going to be talking about family values and balancing work and family values from speaking to the coast guard at a prayer breakfast simply because he differs with congressman stfdds on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed in the military is a gross violation in my opinion of constitutional rights the coast guard obviously wanted gary bauer to speak they obviously wanted him to speak at the prayer breakfast it had been organized for 6 months and it was stopped simply because mr bauer had taken issue with the congressmans position i think it is a mistake i think it should not have happended i think it is very unfortunate i would just like to urge my colleagues to think long and hard before they start interfering with the coast guards right to have anyone they want to
