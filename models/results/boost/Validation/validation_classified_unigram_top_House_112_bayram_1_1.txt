defense has taken no steps to award combat benefits to the casualties or even officially recognize the attack as a terrorist incident the house and senate have included two reform measures in the ndaa which we just passed while additional attacks have been attempted by similar highprofile radical islamic terrorists it is past time for the government to deliver on this act here we are almost 3 years later and theres been a recent report that has come out and in that report it references this incident of this slaughter of american troops on fort hood soil in texas it references that it shall be taken up as part of workplace violence the obama regime calls the fort hood shooting workplace violence sure its workplace violence its where they work and its violence but we have a concept of what workplace violence is and your normal workplace violence is not preceded by a shout by the shooter god is great in the arabic language its not preceded by discussions by the alleged perpetrator its alleged because he hasnt been convicted yet and we in a free american world take the position that all are innocent until proven guilty so we will call him the alleged shooter but theres clear evidence in reports by the defense department and by reports by the news media reports by witnesses on the scene reports by his fellow soldiers reports by folks from walter reed hospital where this americantrained militarytrained doctor worked that he had advocated that the american soldier was wrong and that he was contrary and he spoke and preached islamic terrorism so your normal workplace violence thats not a part of the factor yet this is what happened in this case senator collins on wednesday blasted the defense department and bless her for it for classifying the fort hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nations armed forces at home ive been talking about this now since the day after this happened we cant have a world where political correctness fails to define the criminal act by its very nature whether were talking about military law and the criminal relations in military law were just talking about criminal acts in general we have to be able to define them just to make the system work we have to be able to define them but more importantly we owe a duty and a responsibility to the american soldier to call an event what it is and not try to put a smokescreen over it or cloud the issue or in any way worry about the feelings of groups because the definition is the definition this man identified himself that he was committing this act in the name of god is great in arabic he acknowledged when questioned that it was part of his mission he acknowledged that he had dealt with terrorist spokesmen in the past and that the concept came from his interaction with awlaki and others so this guy is an islamic terrorist theres no other way you can describe this gentleman but now years after the event as he sits in the bell county jail in belton texas we continue to have reports coming down from our defense department that the folks that are responsible for our soldiers and responsible for those who died in this incident want to downplay this to be treated as an incident of workplace violence with all the white bread connotation that that has to me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so lets look at some of the evidence we have that connects this to islamic terrorism recognizing the november 5 2009 attack on fort hood texas as an act of radical islamic terrorism and jihad anwar awlaki connection now mr awlaki is no longer with us we have taken that boy out yet the bottom line is at the time this happened they were directly connected this man preached taught and encouraged violenceislamic terrorist violence hasans presentations to the dod on jihad justification he would argue with his fellow soldiers about the justification for having jihad against the american military mr hasan was a member of the united states army he was a major he had been serving in the medical corps as a psychiatrist he was trained with american taxpayer dollars but he was preaching jihad to soldiers and there was lots of evidence i had a bill which was included in this recent defense bill that we just passed it said that this guy was telling people that hed believed in this kind of thing since medical school now hes a major serving as a psychiatrist advising our soldiers hasan purchased and practiced with highcapacity firearms prior to the attack he went out and he bought firearms he bought them at a local gun store of the guns that were used in the killings one of them was a semiautomatic weapon with a large magazine capacity he went out to the firing range and familiarized himself with these weapons prior to this incident you cant think of this as some guy who goes postal all of a sudden this guy was planning this whole event he shouts god is great in arabic before he starts shooting but they refer to it in the context of the broader threat of workplace violence i think there is a very good argument that the evidence shows this was a premeditated act on the part of major hasan and i believe when this case finally gets to trial that the evidence will be overwhelming that it was premeditated at the time of the event lieutenant general cone the iii corps commander at fort hood told nbcs today show on the friday after the shooting that the soldiers who witnessed the shooting rampage that left 13 people dead reported that the gunman shouted allahu akbar which means god is great before opening fire at the texas post the day after it was being reported that he did this yet in the initial report that came out from the defense department the mans name didnt even appear the relationship to any islamic terrorism was not referenced it was like any major from any outfit just wandered in and started shooting soldiers like he was having a bad day or something now we get another comment saying that were going to treat this in the bigger scope of workplace violence certainly we want to prevent workplace violence in every workplace but the connotation is that this is just something that happened its not something that just happened because quite honestly since that time others have been caught who reportedly were trying to imitate this shooter mr hasan we introduced a bill the fort hood families benefits protection act it would award both military and civilian casualties of the ford hood attack with combat status to ensure full benefits and eligibility for the purple heart and other awards and for the civilian award equivalence to the secretary of defenses defense of freedom medal now why did i ask for that because there was a precedent for it when they flew the plane into the pentagon on 9 11 this is what was the finding of the department of defensethat it was an act of terrorism and therefore they should be treated as combat casualties and those two medals were awarded this didnt just come off the top of my head this is what happened with the first terrorist attack in our country and with the second or third or whatever attack this one was when this man walked into that room there were people in civilian garb and there were people in uniform he went out of his way to shoot the people in uniform the civilians who were injured were injured because of misfire or misdirection as he walked down that line his target was all of those soldiers who were doing nothing more than either coming back from being off post and out of the countryor wherever theyd beenor preparing for their next duty stations wherever they may be goingiraq or afghanistan they were being processed and they were in this big room he walked down the line shooting everybody in uniform now when youre killing our combat soldiers and when youre crying out slogans of the jihad terrorists why wouldnt you think its a terrorist attack and why shouldnt these people who died in the line of duty be treated like those at the pentagon who died in the line of duty in fact except for what we were able to put together in circumstantial evidence after the fact at the time of the incident we had no idea who flew that plane into the pentagon we just made an educated guess in this case before this shooting started the guy identified himself and what his mission was for some reason in this world of political correctness someone has the idea that this is good for the morale of our military soldiers or that its good for something as i think the chief of staff said when this happened oh this is sure going to hurt our islamic outreach program whether its good for that or not i hold nothing against the islamic people nor does anybody at fort hood but we hold a lot against islamic terrorists who kill soldiers and the department of defense should have the guts to step up and to stand up for these soldiers i see my good

committee on veterans affairs i rise in support of the senate amendments to h r 1627 this is a comprehensive bipartisan bicameral legislative package to provide for the needs of veterans their families and survivors through improved health care housing education and memorial services in addition the senate amendments to h r 1627 would improve the accountability and transparency of the department of veterans affairs ensuring that va is responsible to those it serves our american veterans as the title of this bill implies this legislation would authorize va health care services for veterans and their families for certain illnesses that manifested as a result of exposure to water contamination at camp lejeune north carolina during a 30year span that ended in 1987 i want to specifically acknowledge the efforts of retired marine master sergeant jerry ensminger whose dogged efforts to seek answers from the government and justice for the victims of the water contamination inspired this bill in honor of jerrys daughter janey who died of leukemia at the age of 9 after time spent at camp lejeune when the water was contaminated title i of this bill bears her name finally i thank representative brad miller and senator richard burr the original sponsors of the camp lejeune legislation in the house and the senate for their leadership and although this legislation represents a hardfought victory we must not forget those who are no longer with us to see it become law i think when senator burr said this he said it best unfortunately many who were exposed have died as a result and are not here to receive the care this bill can provide while i wish we could have accomplished this years ago we now have the opportunity to do the right thing for thousands who were harmed during their service to our country and i couldnt agree more in addition to the veterans of camp lejeune section 106 of this bill contains legislation the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health ms buerkle introduced h r 2074 the veterans sexual assault prevention act the section and her bill which passed the house last year would address the serious failure of the department of veterans affairs to prevent and report sexual assault incidents and corresponding flaws in the security of their facilities it creates a fundamentally safer environment for our veterans and va employees by requiring an accountable and comprehensive oversight system i want to express my personal appreciation to ms buerkle for her advocacy on behalf of women and all of our veterans in just 2 short years she has proven herself to be a committed and strong voice for servicemembers and veterans not only in the state of new york but across this country her considerable expertise as a nurse a lawyer and a mother of six was the reason i chose her to be the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health and i can tell you that in the roll that she has played she has never wavered from doing what is right for all of our veterans the bill also includes several worthy legislative proposals to improve health care services brought forth from our members on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers the house and in the senate this bill also addresses several other areas where we will be able to expand and improve health care for veterans it would allow for greater flexibility in va payments to state veterans homes break down barriers to care for veterans with traumatic brain injury clarify the access rights of service dogs on va property and improve care for rural elderly and homeless veterans this bill also addresses several important matters related to veterans housing because many of our returning wounded warriors need assistance modifying their residences to meet their needs this bill would reauthorize and expand several provisions relating to the specially adapted housing grant program these grants provide funding to eligible disabled veterans and servicemembers who adapt homes that they own or homes that they are currently living in to meet their daily needs adaptations can include grab bars in bathrooms widening doorways for wheelchairs or constructing a wheelchair ramp these grants are imperative to affording veterans the level of independent living that they were accustomed to prior to their injury and that they may not be able to otherwise enjoy as many of us are aware far too many of our veterans have found themselves on hard times and are homeless or are at risk for homelessness to combat this problem this bill would authorize funding for additional housing options for homeless veterans to help them gain stability and obtain access to other treatment and services that they may need from va the next area of the bill would be in addressing education we all know that we have provided a very generous benefit to the veterans in the post9 11 gi bill the problem is that we have never really tracked the performance of the bill or if the benefits are effective in training veterans to be leaders of tomorrow therefore this legislation would increase our oversight of post9 11 educational benefits by requiring annual reports to congress on the effectiveness of these benefits and how theyre being utilized i want to thank my friend congressman gus bilirakis for introducing this provision in h r 2274 and for his leadership on improving transparency for the post9 11 gi bill another critical area addressed by this legislation is that of veteran benefits over the last 3 years weve seen the disability claims backlog grow exponentially with more than 900 000 claims now awaiting decisions fifty percent of those have been pending for a period of 125 days or more despite repeated promises from va to break the backlog it continues to grow therefore the provisions of this bill that address benefit matters will assist in processing claims more efficiently first it would allow veterans to automatically waive regional office review of evidence submitted directly to the board of veterans appeals for claims in appellate status second it would allow veterans in need of assistance with claims to have a signatory on their behalf assist them with the claims process third it would modernize vas statutory duty to assist by authorizing electronic communications potentially saving weeks in a claims processing time fourth to alleviate the burdens of redundant paperwork veterans would now be able to file jointly for social security and indemnity compensation finally to promote accountability of individual claims processors va would be required to present a plan in 6 months on how it will take corrective action when their employees need training to do their jobs well i want to thank my friend mr runyan from new jersey the chairman of the subcommittee on disability assistance and memorial affairs for his dedication to our nations veterans and for his focus on advancing legislation such as h r 2349 which will achieve measurable results in alleviating the backlog of claims while many of these provisions that i have discussed thus far have focused on our efforts to honor our commitment to the brave men and women who serve our nation including those transitioning from the recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan we must also continue our commitment to our fallen heroes accordingly this bill also sets out specific criteria that prohibit disruptions and protests of funerals of members of the armed forces at va national cemeteries and at arlington national cemetery including the imposition of criminal and civil liability for violations of these restrictions in addition given the sacred nature of arlington national cemetery a name synonymous with honoring american freedom this legislation would codify a prohibition on the reservation of grave sites at arlington national cemetery with very limited exceptions i worked closely with mr runyan on this prohibition to ensure that many future generations of american heroes will be buried and honored at arlington national cemetery i want to thank him again for his leadership on this issue and for originally introducing h r 1484 similarly i introduced the original measure on h r 1627 which would place restrictions on the type and placement of monuments at arlington national cemetery due to the fact that the cemetery itself is a monument arlington national cemetery is a unique national treasure it is for this reason that this legislation is necessary to ensure that the integrity of the cemetery is preserved both in its utilization of land with the placement of monuments and with its allocation of grave sites finally this comprehensive legislative package also contains several miscellaneous provisions affecting our nations veterans although these areas may not receive as much attention such as health care or benefits they are no less important to improving the lives of the veterans of this country i want to thank the ranking

unitedstates is still the largest manufacturer in the world churning out about 1 7 trillion in value annually and one in six jobs is tied directly or indirectly to manufacturing manufacturing drives innovation by conducting twothirds of all research and development and creating the bulk of technology in our nation and nearly 70 percent of all exported goods from the united states in 2011 originated from the manufacturing sector in the unitedstates every one dollar in final sales in manufacturing goods supports 1 35 in output from other sectors of the economy that multiplier effect is higher than any other economic sector many other jobs such as those in financial services depend on somebody else making a product if no one makes anything in america anymore than those service sector jobs disappear also i spend about twothirds of my time in congress studying and working on manufacturing issues from raw materials and minerals all the way through export controls in fact earlier today i cohosted a bipartisan briefing with administrative officials on its export control reform initiative i have been in over 500 factories all over the world in china japan europe and the united states ive studied manufacturing schooling and the educational process in switzerland and how important manufacturing is to that tiny country every few years the manufacturing sector in the united states experiences a crisis in response various administrations have prepared strategy reports on how to best respond the last report was issued in 2004 this report was extremely helpful in identifying and reforming regulations that were unduly burdensome on the manufacturing sector that produced little or no public benefit the bill before us today will institutionalize this process by requiring a national manufacturing report so that we can keep the focus of our government on how to best help the strongest economic engine of our economy my office spent years developing a chart to identify the numerous federal programs and agencies that support manufacturing it is still difficult to have a central focal point to know who is manufacturing and who is doing research in a particular area for example if somebody wants to do research on machining titanium there is no central portal through which that person can go to determine exactly what programs there are and who is doing the research fundamentally its very important to have this report why because americans need to know the importance of manufacturing if we dont have manufacturing agriculture and mining in this

connections to subsidize their businesses exim even provided enron with hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance before that companys ignominious collapse do we really want to continue funding the enrons of the world not only is it bad economics to force working americans small businesses and entrepreneurs to subsidize the exports of large corporations it is also immoral redistribution from the poor and middle class to the wealthy is the most indefensible aspect of the welfare state yet it is the most accepted form of welfare at a time when the federal government is running unprecedentedly large budget deficits why are we reauthorizing subsidies for large corporations i hope that my colleagues who criticize welfare for the poor on moral and constitutional grounds will vote against this program that provides welfare for the rich proponents of continued american support for exim claim that the bank creates jobs and promotes economic growth however this claim rests on a version of what the great economist henry hazlitt called the broken window fallacy when a hoodlum throws a rock through a store window it can be said he has contributed to the economy as the store owner will have to spend money having the window fixed the benefits to those who repaired the window are visible for all to see therefore it is easy to see the broken window as economically beneficial however the benefits of the broken window are revealed as an illusion when one takes into account what is not seen the businesses and workers who would have benefited had the store owner not spent money repairing a window but rather been free to spend his money as he chose similarly the beneficiaries of exim are visible to all what is not seen is the products that would have been built the businesses that would have been started and the jobs that would have been created had the funds used for exim been left in the hands of consumers leaving those funds in the private sector ensures that those resources will be put to the use most highly valued by individual consumers in contrast when the government diverts resources into the public sector via programs such as exim their use is determined by bureaucrats and politically powerful special interests resulting in a distorted market and a misallocation of resources by distorting the market and preventing resources from achieving their highest valued use exim actually costs americans jobs and reduces americas standard of living finally i would like to remind my colleagues that there is simply no constitutional justification for the expenditure of funds on programs such as exim in fact the framers of the constitution would be horrified to know that the federal government was taking hardearned money from the american people in order to benefit the politically powerful in conclusion exim distorts the market by allowing government bureaucrats to make economic decisions instead of individual consumers exim also violates basic principles of morality by forcing american taxpayers to subsidize the operations of wealthy companies that could easily afford to engage in international trade without government assistance exim also violates the limitations on congressional power to take the property of individual citizens and use it to benefit powerful special interests it is for these reasons that i

creating energy independence but liberals in congress are standing in the way i urge my colleagues to consider all the good republican energy bills would do for jobs our economy and our gas tanks it is imperative that the senate signs these bills and the president signs them into law"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today the house of representatives will consider the prenatal nondiscrimination act a bill to ban the practice of sexselection abortions if you talk to most expectant couples youll hear a common refrain we dont care whether its a boy or a girl we just want a healthy baby in fact even with advanced ultrasound technology many parents choose to wait until birth to discover the sex of their child unfortunately there are exceptions some couples will do anything to choose the sex of their child in the majority of these cases boys are favored and girls are aborted i know most americans think this is something that happens overseas in places like china and india however a columbia university study found evidence that sex selection at the prenatal level is happening right here in the united states just yesterday the group live action released undercover video of a planned parenthood clinic in austin texas counseling a woman on how to choose the sex of her child we shouldnt wait any longer to ban this barbaric and socially unhealthy practice its time to pass the bill"],

people wars have been fought to conquer land wars have been fought to acquire resources wars have been fought to spread ideas what is constant is that with each succeeding battle both the tools and the techniques of warfare have progressed from the earliest days of using rocks and sticks to the advancement of bows and arrows to flintlock and then automatic weapons to tnt atomic and nuclear bombs man has continued to find ways new ways of inflicting greater destruction on each other my father served in world war ii my older brother served in vietnam i myself served in operations desert shield and desert storm iraqi freedom and enduring freedom and my nephew continues to serve in the united states army and has already been deployed to afghanistan twice the only thing we know for sure is that the enemies my nephew has faced and will face in the future are altogether different from the enemy my father found in europe and my brother found in southeast asia unlike any conflict this nation has ever undertaken from lexington and concord to gettysburg and antietam from belleau wood and the marne to normandy and iwo jima from the chosin reservoir to khe sanh to the persian gulf this 21st century battlefield is not defined by columns fronts uniforms or borders but rather about one ideology against another today i want to speak about this 21st century battlefield one that is vastly different from any we have faced before if we are not as prepared to fight in this new virtual environment as we would be to fight in unfamiliar physical surroundings it will be just as likely to effect our downfall as the jungles in indochina were to the colonial french troops it is clear the united states congress the media and americans are truly focused on the dire economic situation here at home and i share those concerns i also recognize the importance of not turning our backs on the principal obligation vested in us as elected leaders to protect and defend the united states of america against enemies foreign and domestic the wars that my father and brother fought in and the cold war we were engaged in when we first put on those uniforms 30 years ago all of them were clearly defined we knew our enemy we knew his tactics we knew his weapons and the uniform he wore we even at times laid down our arms temporarily to observe religious holidays like christmas and tet but with the advent of the 21st century battlefield that paradigm no longer exists if we are going to achieve our objectives we must be ready to adapt to changing circumstances we cannot simply understand our enemy we must define it in 2012 more than 10 years after the twin towers fell in the city of which you represent there is still a debate in this country about whom were fighting so today let us set aside political correctness in order to fully define the enemy weve been at war with for decades since years before commercial airliners slammed into the pentagon crashed in a field in pennsylvania and took the lives of over 2 000 citizens in new york let me be perfectly clear the free world is not engaged in a war on terror terrorism is a tactic and no nation or coalition of nations can go to war against a tactic for instance the united states was not engaged in a war against the blitzkrieg or the kamikaze in 1941 through 1945 al qaeda and the taliban are indeed our enemy but we are not at war with al qaeda or the taliban they are simply the regiments and battalions of the ideological army to which they belong the united states was not at war with the 12th german panzer division or the 55th japanese infantry regiment from 1941 to 1945 in fact before the rise of al qaeda the terrorist group that had inflicted the most damage on the united states was hezbollah and let us never forget the loss in the beirut bombing of those 240someodd marines today hezbollah has evolved into a highly capable military force albeit one without state or uniform so capable in fact they have armed missiles within striking distance of every city in israel yet several american presidential administrations have failed to clearly identify hezbollah as an enemy until we as a nation are able to correctly and openly identify our enemy we will continue to put our men and women on the ground in harms way without a clear mission for success on this 21st century battlefield we are not fighting against a single organization a single leader or a single nation we are fighting against a radical islamic fundamentalism which knows no country recognizes no borders and wears no uniform it is islamism a theocratic political totalitarian ideology no different from nazism fascism and communism which threatens the free world our enemy does not distinguish between combatants be them lawful combatants unlawful combatants or even noncombatants as required by the geneva convention our enemy does not distinguish between military and civilian targets so how do we understand the complexities of this global conflagration in which we are engaged and how do we make the changes necessary to defeat it with the appropriate strategic level of perspective because we will never lose at the tactical level on the ground because the united states has the best soldiers sailors airmen marines and coastguardsmen the world has ever known but without the correct strategic and operational goals well be on the proverbial hamster wheel no matter how much effort we exert we will not make forward progress so now that we have defined the enemy we must develop strategic imperatives i believe that there are three strategic imperatives to engage to deter and to strike we must clearly then identify specific strategic level objectives and there are four first we must deny the enemy sanctuary the number one asset our military has is its strategic mobility when that is curtailed by a focus on nationbuilding or occupationstyle warfare we eliminate our primary advantage and worse turn our military forces into targets because this enemy truly indeed has no respect for those borders and boundaries therefore we must be willing to take the fight directly to him second we must interdict the enemys flow of men material and resources we have to cut off the enemys ability to fund supply and replenish his ranks as my colleague just spoke our own energy independence is a vital part of that goal third we must win the information war unfortunately the enemy is far more adept at exploiting the power of the internet broadcast media and dissemination of powerful imagery in addition i fear that there are some in our media who now see themselves as an ideological political wing if we cannot fully utilize information as a resource and part of our national power we will lose this battle if not our country the great example of this occurred during the tet offensive when the north vietnamese used information to their benefit against a superior american fighting force despite their own troops being badly depleted in the attack our enemies were able to paint the outcome as a devastating loss for the united states a former vietcong minister of justice truong nhu tang would later write it is a major irony of the vietnam war that our propaganda transmuted this military debacle into a brilliant victory giving us new leverage in our diplomatic efforts inciting the american antiwar movement and disheartening the washington planners today the islamic fundamentalist enemy collectively portrays themselves as the victims of imperialism just as the axis and communist powers defined the free world as aggressors in order to cover up their crimes and designs for global domination totalitarian islam seeks to replicate the exact same strategy the nowdeceased osama bin laden incited violence against americans by invoking just such language when he said unitedstates soldiers only fight for capitalists usury takers and the merchants of arms and oil including the gang of crime at the white house under these circumstances there will be no harm if the interests of muslims converge with the interests of socialists in the fight against the crusaders fourth as far as strategic objectives we must cordon off the enemy and reduce his sphere of influence we have to shrink the enemys territory and not allow any political cultural educational and financial infiltration into the united states what happened with major malik nadal hasan at fort hood texas should not have been possible in this country we must not turn a blind eye to a bold enemy who is telling us exactly what he wants to do and who is willing to bring the battle to our doorsteps furthermore for us to classify this jihadist attack as workplace violence defies sanity it is important that we must not hamstring our troops through the rules of engagement let us trust our men and women who are fighting for the preservation of this great constitutional republic and that includes our domestic law enforcement these should be our goals deny the enemy sanctuary cut off his flow of resources use information to our advantage and reduce his sphere of influence we must recognize that iraq and afghanistan are not wars but combat theaters of operation it is up to our elected leaders and strategiclevel military officials to identify and agree on the correct goals and objectives beyond identifying the enemy and defining our objectives in kinetic battle we must also understand and recognize the truly nonkinetic conflicts of the 21st century battlefield one need only review the collapse of the soviet union to understand great nations can be toppled economically as well as militarily in fact one country paid particular close attention to the fall of the soviet union and that was china in fact chinas efforts to modernize its economy were taken explicitly from the playbook of lenin during the period of the new economic policy lenin sought to place market mechanisms in a communist economy to preserve the rule of the party and modernize this wars industries it also sought to deceive the west into believing that communism had been weakened and was therefore a less formidable opponent china has been mimicking this tactic for decades its time that we took notice currently the united states is providing a great economic advantage to china by allowing them to have an incredible trade surplus and hold nearly 30 percent of our debt we must recognize that china is not using that advantage to improve the standard of living of its citizens instead it is taking its economic edge to the 21st century battlefield within 10 years the worlds largest bluewater navy will fly not under a united states but a chinese flag why is that important because no matter how technology changes in the future the earths surface will still be covered 70 percent by water all of the great civilizationsfrom the venetians to the romans to the portuguese spanish dutch english and the japaneseunderstood that the power and reach of a nation is extended not through a great army but through a strong navy in 1990 the united states possessed 570 naval war vessels today we have 285projected to go even lower if we cannot protect the sea lanes of commerce we leave ourselves vulnerable not just militarily but economically to a power in china that continues to seek world communism as its ultimate goal irrefutably so i could spend the entire special order talking about china because i believe in this century china could become the premier dominant nation in the world and while the relationship between china and the united states is based on mutual needs at this moment i am concerned for the day when china realizes this relationship is more of a hindrance than a need and we always need to prepare if that day is to come as a veteran of operation iraqi freedom who served during the initial battles of that conflict i am proud to be among the more than 1 million americans who served in iraq what my fellow comrades in arms achieved in that country is nothing short of historic together we defeated one of historys most tyrannical dictatorships and replaced it with what could be a free and democratic muslim government american soldiers sailors airmen and marines beat back a radical islamic insurgency and helped create what we hope foran ally and partner in freedom i will never forget those with whom i served and those who served after i left that battlefield i will always remember the sacrifice borne by so many servicemembers and their families however i have to question the motives of president barack obama in announcing a full withdrawal of american forces in october of 2011 did the president press the commanders on the ground before making that decision what kind of message does our sudden withdrawal send to our allies such as the kurds in the northern part of iraq do they feel abandoned yet again my fear is that political expediency drove that decision not recommendations from the military leadership not a strategic understanding of the 21st century battlefield for over 10 years our nation has been on the offensive against islamic totalitarianism radical islamic terrorism and specific individuals who want to harm our country and kill our citizens ten years ago a band of thugs declared war on the united states our fellow americans and our way of life the last decade in afghanistan has seen peaks and valleys triumph and tragedy unspeakable horror and unimaginable bravery during our long and difficult march towards victory while a decade may seem like a long period of time we must remember that our enemies have been at war with our way of life for nearly a generation from beirut to the khobar towers from the uss cole to the first bombing of the world trade center from the total destruction of the united states embassies in kenya and tanzania to september 11 we must never forget that we did not choose this fightthe fight chose us while we may not have executed this combat operation perfectlybut then no war ever has beenwe cannot pretend that radical islam does not exist the killings of osama bin laden and other radical terrorist leaders are significant victories however the fight continues there is evil in this world that must be confronted lest our nation sees more of its citizens maimed and killed in acts of terror i will continue to urge our president and his administration my colleagues on capitol hill and our congressional leadership to pressure pakistan to crack down on terrorists within their borders a particular concern is the haqqani network which is responsible for so much violence and bloodshed i urge our leaders on both sides of the aisle to finish what was started in this part of the world ten years after september 11 it remains absolutely vital to our national security that we succeed in afghanistan and how do we define success we cannot grant the enemy another opportunity to use that country as a home base for planning strikes against our nation deny the enemy sanctuary unconditional withdrawal from afghanistan as we have done in iraq without considering the ground situation or the advice of top military advisers would be absolutely reckless allowing afghanistan to revert to its previous condition under taliban control overturns the progress made so dearly by our forces and it creates new threats to all americans and this world let me be clear if we exit without delivering a crushing blow to the taliban and other extremists therein they will bring the fight to us and while i believe the men and women serving in afghanistan are performing bravely above and beyond it is vital that they are given all the tools necessary to succeed we must ensure that they have the proper equipment the proper weapons systems a clearly defined mission but most importantly flexible rules of engagement that do not needlessly put their lives at risk recently prime minister benjamin netanyahu was in the united states delivering remarks that reinforce that the state of israel is a bright light in a dark ocean of tyranny and oppression israel must be allowed to defend itself from external and internal aggression the israeli people must be allowed to continue to build within their own borders and jerusalem must be recognized irrefutably as the nations only capital furthermore the united states must stand by israels side in the face of a united nations which clearly views the state of israel through a lens tinged with antisemitic hatred which unfortunately we just saw played out in france anything less than full support for israel and its citizens at the united nations by the united states government is simply unacceptable i am concerned that israel americas strongest and most loyal ally in the middle east has become more isolated and vilified since barack obama became president than ever before in its existence and i believe the united states congress has a solemn duty to ensure that the homeland of the jewish people remains as such the united states and israel share the common bonds of freedom liberty and democracy and the right to worship in the name of any religion as you see fit we share a common enemy though in radical islam and we have both seen our citizens murdered by these terrorist thugs we are indeed each others greatest ally for without the united states israel would not exist and without israel the united states would soon fall today the bonds between us must be stronger than ever because those bonds are threatened as never before israel is a small country surrounded by enemies the united states however is a large country being infiltrated by the same enemies like us the israelis seek only to be one nation under god with liberty and justice for all and as the bible makes clear in leviticus chapter 25 verse 10 our purpose is to proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof the bottom line is this our judeochristian faith heritage calls us to duty to stand beside the modernday state of israel therefore if we discuss israel we must discuss the palestinian authority it is quite simple no entity that aligns itself with a group that calls for the complete and total destruction of another country should ever be granted statehood i will never support funding for the palestinian authority or the recognition of a palestinian state as long as they are reconciled and connected with hamas further i have cosponsored house resolution 394 to support israels right to annex judea and samaria if the palestinian authority continues to press for the unilateral recognition of palestinian statehood at the united nations a united nationsrecognized palestinian state could place israelis under the sovereignty of a group that actively seeks their destruction this is unacceptable and in the absence of a negotiated peace agreement israel has the right to protect its citizens living in judea and samaria by annexing those territories there cannot be peace without a growing peace party now more than ever is a time to stand with our ally israel and thanks in large part to the socalled arab spring of democratic revolutionaries israel is beleaguered and surrounded by hostility on all sides the israeli embassy in cairo egypt was almost seized and turkey once a prominent ally has even shown intimations of threatening israel with war all the while hamas terrorists in gaza fire rockets into israeli cities on a pretty much daily basis there is a realistic chance that many european countries will recognize a palestinian state russia is already offering enthusiastic support for a declaration of statehood and last year president obama expressed his hope for such an outcome the palestinians are now using that support as part of their media campaign even the democrat party is opposing congresswoman ileana roslehtinens commonsense legislation house resolution 2829 this bill seeks more transparency and accountability within the united nations an organization that allows countries like china cuba saudi arabia and others to control the human rights council the bill also requires steps to be taken to dismantle terrorist infrastructures and arrest terrorists control palestinian security organizations and end the incitement of violence and hatred in the palestinian media educational institutions and mosques and most importantly it requires the united nations to recognize israels right to exist as a jewish state i am pleased to support this legislation and commend my florida colleague the chairwoman of the committee on foreign affairs for introducing this legislation lets be clear there is no greater threat to israel and the united states today than the development of nuclear weapons by iran president obama has tried to take the diplomatic route when negotiating with iran but that is an effort that has indisputably failed iran has twice sent their warships through the suez canal within the last year in a blatant message to israel and recently an iranian defense official threatened to send warships to the east coast of the united states of america i believe iran poses a genuine threat to democracies around the world iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad spouts hatred against freedom of speech and religion everywhere while opposing his own people at home further he denies the holocaust ever happened and has stated that anybody who recognizes israel will burn in the fire of the islamic nations fury iran continues to push for nuclear weapons and has the capability to enrich uranium it remains a state sponsor of terrorism and has aided internationally recognized terrorist organizations like hezbollah hezbollah along with organizations like hamas and al qaeda is committed to seeing the destruction of the democratic freedoms that we treasure along with the state of israel in its entirety as a member of the united states house of representatives one of my objectives is to protect the safety and security of israel a stable israel is important to a stable united states and iran is a constant threat to that stability we must stop lying to ourselves about iran for we are barreling toward a point at which we wont be able to prevent that nation from acquiring nuclear weapons without a massive military strike it must not come to that iran is merely months away from producing sufficient weaponsgrade uranium for a 15kiloton bomb a development which will put american naval vessels and the strait of hormuz at risk as you know i have spent a lot of my adult life in uniform some of it on that field of battle in iraq those of us who fought in operation iraqi freedom knew that our enemies received considerable assistance from the islamic republic of iran many of the terrorist thugs who targeted american troops in that combat operation just as many of those who target our troops in afghanistan today received guidance training weapons money and an untold number of explosives that have killed or terribly maimed so many of our nations finest our comrades we knew it without a doubt we knew it because the components of those bombs bore irrefutable proof of iranian manufacture yet to this day most americans are unaware of the support the iraqi insurgency received from the iranians iran declared war on the united states of america nearly 33 years ago and has waged that war ever since the iranian war against america is not limited to our troops indeed as we have recently learned from the attorney general and the director of the fbi the iranians are prepared to kill american civilians right here in washington if they happen to be in the same place at the same time as an intended target of assassination our dealings with iran are not a partisan political matter a failure to respond to their murderous attacks is a national failure not a failure of one party or another or one leader or set of leaders this is a war whether we decide to fight it or not they are waging war against us yet our public discourse rarely if ever bothers to mention that fact every so often someone will remind us that iran is the worlds leading sponsor of terrorism but even that does not encapsulate the truth of the matter they are killing us every single day if you want to see what the consequences of an iranian victory would look like just observe what life is like for the citizens of iran anyone who voices opposition to the government or complains about the oppressive treatment of the nations women is arrested tortured and often killed independent newspapers have long since been silenced access to the internet is blocked or filtered with the same technology used in the peoples republic of china the washington post editorialist writing about the iranians feverish efforts to construct atomic weapons put it very bluntly when they wrote by now it should be obvious that only regime change will stop the iranian nuclear program and only regime change will stop the iranian war against america only regime change will bring an end to the mullahs global dream the washington post thinks that sanctions can help provided they are serious sanctions that strike at the heart of irans financial system i have no problem supporting such an effort but i doubt that that will be enough because sanctions are only effective when a regime cares for its people iran is a theocracy an acquisition of a nuclear weapon will enable them to achieve their goal the restoration of the islamic caliphate we have another even more powerful weapon to aim at the islamic dictatorship of iran the iranian people and its time to use it there can be no doubt that the people of iran are yearning for new leaders 21 2 years ago millions of them took to the streets to protest against election fraud and to call for an end to the islamic dictatorship there can be little doubt that unlike so many of the uprisings in the muslim world the overwhelming majority of the iranians do not want radical jihadist overlords they want a separation of mosque and state with the mullahs in the mosque not running the state of all the opposition movements in the muslim middle east the iranian one is the closest to us the only one that surely wants to be part of the western world so why then has the iranian opposition movement not been explicitly endorsed by our government why do the president and the secretary of state continue to talk about reaching an agreement with the tehran regime why does the president not say that ahmadinejad and khomeini must go if qadhafi had to go and mubarak had to go and assad must go why not the iranian terror masters since the president and the secretary of state are unwilling to spell it out i will offer my assistance ahmadinejad and khomeini have to go along with their evil henchmen we need clear language from our leaders that states down with the islamic republic of iran which represents a clear and present evil in our world we hereby call for a free iran and we are willing to support an effort by the iranian people to liberate their country president ronald reagan recognized the threat of inaction and he laid out a road map on how to confront evil in our world three decades ago first tell the truth tell it often tell it everywhere the truth is that iran is in the clutches of evil people who kill iranians and support the killing of israelis and americans every day and who will kill even more if and when they get nuclear atomic bombs and warheads the truth is that we have tried to reach some sort of reasonable agreement with them for more than 30 years the truth is they dont want it they want to destroy us and thats what they mean when they chant death to america second our leaders and representatives must call for the release of political prisoners being persecuted in that country to include the iranian christian minister being threatened with execution when our diplomats attend international conferences they should arrive with lists of victims in iran and they should read those lists its harder for totalitarian regimes to kill people with names than to slaughter faceless victims third we should broadcast the facts to the iranian people they need to know that we stand with them they need to know whats going on inside their country this is based on our experience during the cold war when it turned out people inside the soviet union knew more about events in london and paris and washington than inside their own borders thats why radio free europe and radio liberty were such potent instruments of peace our broadcasts are often jammed by the iranian regime we must defeat their censorship finally we have to track down the killers of americans and bring them to justice the world must know anyone that takes an american life will be targeted and taken out in any country on the planet those who kill our citizens will not find safe haven in iran a majority of the america media did not feel it was important to report that iranian president ahmadinejad visited cuba venezuela ecuador and nicaragua this past january president ahmadinejad threatened almost 200 years of precedent established by the monroe doctrine when he declared that from now on latin america will no longer be in the backyard of the united states president ahmadinejad is assisting hugo chavez with missile sites and has joked with that south american dictator about pointing a warhead at the united states and there are hezbollah camps in south america chavez himself has offered to send troops to fight with the taliban and has reportedly funded al qaeda president ahmadinejad has recruited the mexican drug cartels for an attempted assassination of a saudi ambassador in the united states president ahmadinejads sphere of influence is not limited to the middle east he is entering our hemisphere and showing the influence that he has in this region and that goes back to our fourth strategic objective president obama seems to be uninterested in the principles of the monroe doctrine because after all he did take the wrong side in honduras and he has laughed it up with hugo chavez the syrian government meanwhile is continuing its vicious crackdown on innocent syrian civilians seeking only freedom and democracy according to available figures almost 10 000 syrians have lost their lives and thousands more have been injured many more have been forced to flee the international atomic energy agency also recently concluded that the secret syrian facility destroyed by israel in september of 2007 was very likely a nuclear reactor based on a north korean model capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons the syrian government has become a conduit in irans arming of hezbollah shiite forces in lebanon and hamas in gaza they have provided a safe docking station for iranian warships and they possess an arsenal of chemical weapons and missiles that i fear could end up in the hands of terrorists with which they are associated the threat posed by the assad regime to the united states to our allies and the syrian people is stark and growing the time to increase pressure on that regime is now that is why i joined other members of congress in sending a letter to president obama requesting that he implement additional sanctions on syria the people of that country deserve a government that represents their aspirations and respects their basic human rights it is clear that bashar alassad is not willing to implement genuine reforms and that he lacks the legitimacy to lead the syrian people the united states and all responsible nations must hold the regime accountable and the brutality must end additional sanctions would show the syrian people that we stand with them in their struggle for democratic freedoms while also making it clear to the syrian regime that it will pay an increasingly high cost for its gross violations of human rights and dignity which is why unesco should expel syria and strongly condemn them and not repeatedly attack israel but however we must realize that theres an interesting turn in syria with the iranian and russian presence evolving it was not too long ago the american people watched a transition in egypt with this administration claiming we were witnessing a new dawn of democracy today instead we are witnessing the nightmare of one of the greatest threats to the stability in the middle east a new egyptian government under the muslim brotherhood the egyptian parliament is now controlled by a majority of radical islamists and the muslim brotherhood is turning egypt into a radical islamic state the muslim brotherhood also maintains active ties to hamas a terrorist organization that openly calls for the destruction of israel of course america should stand with the egyptian people however if the radical elements of the muslim brotherhood are left unchecked in that country the security of the citizens of israel egypt and the united states all will be in jeopardy on july 19 2011 i wrote a letter to the house committee on armed services chairman buck mckeon on the troubling revelation of a possible unitedstates military sale to the government of egypt it stated in my letter it has come to my attention that the defense security cooperative agency notified congress on july 1 2011 of a possible foreign military sale to the government of egypt for 125 miai abrams tank kits for coproduction and associated weapons equipment and parts training and logistical support america must continue to stand with the egyptian people and encourage them to build their own democracy with new political parties and freedoms however we must exercise caution with regard to military sales and support to the egyptian government until a government is formed absent of the radical elements of the muslim brotherhood that would maintain an active peace with israel speaking of the muslim brotherhood i would like to quote to you directly from a former supreme guide of the international muslim brotherhood in december of 2005 mohammed akef said the brotherhood is a global movement whose members cooperate with each other throughout the world based on the same religious world view the spread of islam until it rules the world three years ago a court found a muslim charity right here in the united states guilty of funneling millions of dollars to the terrorist group hamas that was the holy land foundation trial the council of islamic relations cair was named as an unindicted coconspirator that case included testimony that hamas parent organization the muslim brotherhood planned to establish a network of organizations to spread the militant islamist message right here in the united states in its own explanatory memorandum for north america the muslim brotherhood stated that its strategic goal is to establish an islamic center in every city in order to supply our battalions through its various front organizations in the united states the muslim brotherhood is succeeding in cultural whitewashing to eliminate all references to islamist terrorism in our public discourse after the 9 11 commission identified islamic terrorism as a threat in this country the muslim public affairs council recommended the united states government find other terminology as a result the fbi counterterrorism lexicon and the 2009 national intelligence strategy included not a single reference to islam muslim the muslim brotherhood hamas or hezbollah furthermore after major nidal hasans attack on fort hood the department of defense report used the terms violent extremism and islam only once in a footnote again that incident was officially classified as workplace violence we must also be concerned about north korea i was stationed in north korea in 1995 along the demilitarized zone i stood on the 38th parallel and looked through the barbed wire and landmines and there you can see a repressed nation i saw for myself what a ticking timebomb that country can be sooner or later north korea will either implode or it will explode the situation in north korea most closely resembles a street gang where the leader of the gang is killed and a young guy must step up in that instance it is critical for the newly appointed top dog to establish his credibility by proving himself and today north korea is ruled by a 28yearold appointed fourstar general now it took me 22 years to become a lieutenant colonel you can begin to understand how dangerous a situation is brewing just west of the sea of japan the tactics do not change and the game is getting tired anytime north korea finds itself in need of money it saber rattles with the threat of a secret nuclear arms program it has fired artillery onto the south korea island and sunk five south korean naval vessels again and again the international community responds with misguided attempts to buy the country off threaten to go nuclear and get funding in exchange i call that international extortion the dprk newspaper nodong sinmun and other mouthpieces for the workers party of korea sensed this policy of weakness and referred to the disbursement of food and aid as tribute if theres one thing weve learned its that the north koreans cannot be trusted to voluntarily disarm they are playing our country and the entire western world for fools sooner or later well need to step up and stand up to this simmering menace just a few hundred miles from japan in conclusion if we miss this opportunity to recognize the 21st century battlefieldand understand we did not talk about africa we did not talk about somalia and we did not talk about our own border security i thank my colleague from indiana for speaking about energy independence but if we miss this opportunity for understanding what this battlefield truly is to understand the threats and to lay out a strategic vigil for victory we will lose the opportunity to ensure that our children and grandchildren of america will have a secure future as a country we must roll up our sleeves and devise a roadmap for security we must be mindful of the wise words penned by sun tzu in the book the art of war more than 25 centuries ago to know your enemy and to know yourself and to know your environment in countless battles you will always be

to award combat benefits to the casualties or even officially recognize the attack as a terrorist incident the house and senate have included two reform measures in the ndaa which we just passed while additional attacks have been attempted by similar highprofile radical islamic terrorists it is past time for the government to deliver on this act here we are almost 3 years later and theres been a recent report that has come out and in that report it references this incident of this slaughter of american troops on fort hood soil in texas it references that it shall be taken up as part of workplace violence the obama regime calls the fort hood shooting workplace violence sure its workplace violence its where they work and its violence but we have a concept of what workplace violence is and your normal workplace violence is not preceded by a shout by the shooter god is great in the arabic language its not preceded by discussions by the alleged perpetrator its alleged because he hasnt been convicted yet and we in a free american world take the position that all are innocent until proven guilty so we will call him the alleged shooter but theres clear evidence in reports by the defense department and by reports by the news media reports by witnesses on the scene reports by his fellow soldiers reports by folks from walter reed hospital where this americantrained militarytrained doctor worked that he had advocated that the american soldier was wrong and that he was contrary and he spoke and preached islamic terrorism so your normal workplace violence thats not a part of the factor yet this is what happened in this case senator collins on wednesday blasted the defense department and bless her for it for classifying the fort hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nations armed forces at home ive been talking about this now since the day after this happened we cant have a world where political correctness fails to define the criminal act by its very nature whether were talking about military law and the criminal relations in military law were just talking about criminal acts in general we have to be able to define them just to make the system work we have to be able to define them but more importantly we owe a duty and a responsibility to the american soldier to call an event what it is and not try to put a smokescreen over it or cloud the issue or in any way worry about the feelings of groups because the definition is the definition this man identified himself that he was committing this act in the name of god is great in arabic he acknowledged when questioned that it was part of his mission he acknowledged that he had dealt with terrorist spokesmen in the past and that the concept came from his interaction with awlaki and others so this guy is an islamic terrorist theres no other way you can describe this gentleman but now years after the event as he sits in the bell county jail in belton texas we continue to have reports coming down from our defense department that the folks that are responsible for our soldiers and responsible for those who died in this incident want to downplay this to be treated as an incident of workplace violence with all the white bread connotation that that has to me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so lets look at some of the evidence we have that connects this to islamic terrorism recognizing the november 5 2009 attack on fort hood texas as an act of radical islamic terrorism and jihad anwar awlaki connection now mr awlaki is no longer with us we have taken that boy out yet the bottom line is at the time this happened they were directly connected this man preached taught and encouraged violenceislamic terrorist violence hasans presentations to the dod on jihad justification he would argue with his fellow soldiers about the justification for having jihad against the american military mr hasan was a member of the united states army he was a major he had been serving in the medical corps as a psychiatrist he was trained with american taxpayer dollars but he was preaching jihad to soldiers and there was lots of evidence i had a bill which was included in this recent defense bill that we just passed it said that this guy was telling people that hed believed in this kind of thing since medical school now hes a major serving as a psychiatrist advising our soldiers hasan purchased and practiced with highcapacity firearms prior to the attack he went out and he bought firearms he bought them at a local gun store of the guns that were used in the killings one of them was a semiautomatic weapon with a large magazine capacity he went out to the firing range and familiarized himself with these weapons prior to this incident you cant think of this as some guy who goes postal all of a sudden this guy was planning this whole event he shouts god is great in arabic before he starts shooting but they refer to it in the context of the broader threat of workplace violence i think there is a very good argument that the evidence shows this was a premeditated act on the part of major hasan and i believe when this case finally gets to trial that the evidence will be overwhelming that it was premeditated at the time of the event lieutenant general cone the iii corps commander at fort hood told nbcs today show on the friday after the shooting that the soldiers who witnessed the shooting rampage that left 13 people dead reported that the gunman shouted allahu akbar which means god is great before opening fire at the texas post the day after it was being reported that he did this yet in the initial report that came out from the defense department the mans name didnt even appear the relationship to any islamic terrorism was not referenced it was like any major from any outfit just wandered in and started shooting soldiers like he was having a bad day or something now we get another comment saying that were going to treat this in the bigger scope of workplace violence certainly we want to prevent workplace violence in every workplace but the connotation is that this is just something that happened its not something that just happened because quite honestly since that time others have been caught who reportedly were trying to imitate this shooter mr hasan we introduced a bill the fort hood families benefits protection act it would award both military and civilian casualties of the ford hood attack with combat status to ensure full benefits and eligibility for the purple heart and other awards and for the civilian award equivalence to the secretary of defenses defense of freedom medal now why did i ask for that because there was a precedent for it when they flew the plane into the pentagon on 9 11 this is what was the finding of the department of defensethat it was an act of terrorism and therefore they should be treated as combat casualties and those two medals were awarded this didnt just come off the top of my head this is what happened with the first terrorist attack in our country and with the second or third or whatever attack this one was when this man walked into that room there were people in civilian garb and there were people in uniform he went out of his way to shoot the people in uniform the civilians who were injured were injured because of misfire or misdirection as he walked down that line his target was all of those soldiers who were doing nothing more than either coming back from being off post and out of the countryor wherever theyd beenor preparing for their next duty stations wherever they may be goingiraq or afghanistan they were being processed and they were in this big room he walked down the line shooting everybody in uniform now when youre killing our combat soldiers and when youre crying out slogans of the jihad terrorists why wouldnt you think its a terrorist attack and why shouldnt these people who died in the line of duty be treated like those at the pentagon who died in the line of duty in fact except for what we were able to put together in circumstantial evidence after the fact at the time of the incident we had no idea who flew that plane into the pentagon we just made an educated guess in this case before this shooting started the guy identified himself and what his mission was for some reason in this world of political correctness someone has the idea that this is good for the morale of our military soldiers or that its good for something as i think the chief of staff said when this happened oh this is sure going to hurt our islamic outreach program whether its good for that or not i hold nothing against the islamic people nor does anybody at fort hood but we hold a lot against islamic terrorists who kill soldiers and the department of defense should have the guts to step up and to stand up for these soldiers i see my good

families and survivors through improved health care housing education and memorial services in addition the senate amendments to h r 1627 would improve the accountability and transparency of the department of veterans affairs ensuring that va is responsible to those it serves our american veterans as the title of this bill implies this legislation would authorize va health care services for veterans and their families for certain illnesses that manifested as a result of exposure to water contamination at camp lejeune north carolina during a 30year span that ended in 1987 i want to specifically acknowledge the efforts of retired marine master sergeant jerry ensminger whose dogged efforts to seek answers from the government and justice for the victims of the water contamination inspired this bill in honor of jerrys daughter janey who died of leukemia at the age of 9 after time spent at camp lejeune when the water was contaminated title i of this bill bears her name finally i thank representative brad miller and senator richard burr the original sponsors of the camp lejeune legislation in the house and the senate for their leadership and although this legislation represents a hardfought victory we must not forget those who are no longer with us to see it become law i think when senator burr said this he said it best unfortunately many who were exposed have died as a result and are not here to receive the care this bill can provide while i wish we could have accomplished this years ago we now have the opportunity to do the right thing for thousands who were harmed during their service to our country and i couldnt agree more in addition to the veterans of camp lejeune section 106 of this bill contains legislation the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health ms buerkle introduced h r 2074 the veterans sexual assault prevention act the section and her bill which passed the house last year would address the serious failure of the department of veterans affairs to prevent and report sexual assault incidents and corresponding flaws in the security of their facilities it creates a fundamentally safer environment for our veterans and va employees by requiring an accountable and comprehensive oversight system i want to express my personal appreciation to ms buerkle for her advocacy on behalf of women and all of our veterans in just 2 short years she has proven herself to be a committed and strong voice for servicemembers and veterans not only in the state of new york but across this country her considerable expertise as a nurse a lawyer and a mother of six was the reason i chose her to be the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health and i can tell you that in the roll that she has played she has never wavered from doing what is right for all of our veterans the bill also includes several worthy legislative proposals to improve health care services brought forth from our members on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers the house and in the senate this bill also addresses several other areas where we will be able to expand and improve health care for veterans it would allow for greater flexibility in va payments to state veterans homes break down barriers to care for veterans with traumatic brain injury clarify the access rights of service dogs on va property and improve care for rural elderly and homeless veterans this bill also addresses several important matters related to veterans housing because many of our returning wounded warriors need assistance modifying their residences to meet their needs this bill would reauthorize and expand several provisions relating to the specially adapted housing grant program these grants provide funding to eligible disabled veterans and servicemembers who adapt homes that they own or homes that they are currently living in to meet their daily needs adaptations can include grab bars in bathrooms widening doorways for wheelchairs or constructing a wheelchair ramp these grants are imperative to affording veterans the level of independent living that they were accustomed to prior to their injury and that they may not be able to otherwise enjoy as many of us are aware far too many of our veterans have found themselves on hard times and are homeless or are at risk for homelessness to combat this problem this bill would authorize funding for additional housing options for homeless veterans to help them gain stability and obtain access to other treatment and services that they may need from va the next area of the bill would be in addressing education we all know that we have provided a very generous benefit to the veterans in the post9 11 gi bill the problem is that we have never really tracked the performance of the bill or if the benefits are effective in training veterans to be leaders of tomorrow therefore this legislation would increase our oversight of post9 11 educational benefits by requiring annual reports to congress on the effectiveness of these benefits and how theyre being utilized i want to thank my friend congressman gus bilirakis for introducing this provision in h r 2274 and for his leadership on improving transparency for the post9 11 gi bill another critical area addressed by this legislation is that of veteran benefits over the last 3 years weve seen the disability claims backlog grow exponentially with more than 900 000 claims now awaiting decisions fifty percent of those have been pending for a period of 125 days or more despite repeated promises from va to break the backlog it continues to grow therefore the provisions of this bill that address benefit matters will assist in processing claims more efficiently first it would allow veterans to automatically waive regional office review of evidence submitted directly to the board of veterans appeals for claims in appellate status second it would allow veterans in need of assistance with claims to have a signatory on their behalf assist them with the claims process third it would modernize vas statutory duty to assist by authorizing electronic communications potentially saving weeks in a claims processing time fourth to alleviate the burdens of redundant paperwork veterans would now be able to file jointly for social security and indemnity compensation finally to promote accountability of individual claims processors va would be required to present a plan in 6 months on how it will take corrective action when their employees need training to do their jobs well i want to thank my friend mr runyan from new jersey the chairman of the subcommittee on disability assistance and memorial affairs for his dedication to our nations veterans and for his focus on advancing legislation such as h r 2349 which will achieve measurable results in alleviating the backlog of claims while many of these provisions that i have discussed thus far have focused on our efforts to honor our commitment to the brave men and women who serve our nation including those transitioning from the recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan we must also continue our commitment to our fallen heroes accordingly this bill also sets out specific criteria that prohibit disruptions and protests of funerals of members of the armed forces at va national cemeteries and at arlington national cemetery including the imposition of criminal and civil liability for violations of these restrictions in addition given the sacred nature of arlington national cemetery a name synonymous with honoring american freedom this legislation would codify a prohibition on the reservation of grave sites at arlington national cemetery with very limited exceptions i worked closely with mr runyan on this prohibition to ensure that many future generations of american heroes will be buried and honored at arlington national cemetery i want to thank him again for his leadership on this issue and for originally introducing h r 1484 similarly i introduced the original measure on h r 1627 which would place restrictions on the type and placement of monuments at arlington national cemetery due to the fact that the cemetery itself is a monument arlington national cemetery is a unique national treasure it is for this reason that this legislation is necessary to ensure that the integrity of the cemetery is preserved both in its utilization of land with the placement of monuments and with its allocation of grave sites finally this comprehensive legislative package also contains several miscellaneous provisions affecting our nations veterans although these areas may not receive as much attention such as health care or benefits they are no less important to improving the lives of the veterans of this country i want to thank the ranking

innovation by conducting twothirds of all research and development and creating the bulk of technology in our nation and nearly 70 percent of all exported goods from the united states in 2011 originated from the manufacturing sector in the unitedstates every one dollar in final sales in manufacturing goods supports 1 35 in output from other sectors of the economy that multiplier effect is higher than any other economic sector many other jobs such as those in financial services depend on somebody else making a product if no one makes anything in america anymore than those service sector jobs disappear also i spend about twothirds of my time in congress studying and working on manufacturing issues from raw materials and minerals all the way through export controls in fact earlier today i cohosted a bipartisan briefing with administrative officials on its export control reform initiative i have been in over 500 factories all over the world in china japan europe and the united states ive studied manufacturing schooling and the educational process in switzerland and how important manufacturing is to that tiny country every few years the manufacturing sector in the united states experiences a crisis in response various administrations have prepared strategy reports on how to best respond the last report was issued in 2004 this report was extremely helpful in identifying and reforming regulations that were unduly burdensome on the manufacturing sector that produced little or no public benefit the bill before us today will institutionalize this process by requiring a national manufacturing report so that we can keep the focus of our government on how to best help the strongest economic engine of our economy my office spent years developing a chart to identify the numerous federal programs and agencies that support manufacturing it is still difficult to have a central focal point to know who is manufacturing and who is doing research in a particular area for example if somebody wants to do research on machining titanium there is no central portal through which that person can go to determine exactly what programs there are and who is doing the research fundamentally its very important to have this report why because americans need to know the importance of manufacturing if we dont have manufacturing agriculture and mining in this

moral and constitutional reasons the exportimport bank is a prime example of corporate welfare taking money from american taxpayers to prop up the export businesses of large corporations companies such as boeing should be able to make sales based solely on the quality of their products and the willingness of the market to purchase those products instead these companies rely on their political connections to subsidize their businesses exim even provided enron with hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance before that companys ignominious collapse do we really want to continue funding the enrons of the world not only is it bad economics to force working americans small businesses and entrepreneurs to subsidize the exports of large corporations it is also immoral redistribution from the poor and middle class to the wealthy is the most indefensible aspect of the welfare state yet it is the most accepted form of welfare at a time when the federal government is running unprecedentedly large budget deficits why are we reauthorizing subsidies for large corporations i hope that my colleagues who criticize welfare for the poor on moral and constitutional grounds will vote against this program that provides welfare for the rich proponents of continued american support for exim claim that the bank creates jobs and promotes economic growth however this claim rests on a version of what the great economist henry hazlitt called the broken window fallacy when a hoodlum throws a rock through a store window it can be said he has contributed to the economy as the store owner will have to spend money having the window fixed the benefits to those who repaired the window are visible for all to see therefore it is easy to see the broken window as economically beneficial however the benefits of the broken window are revealed as an illusion when one takes into account what is not seen the businesses and workers who would have benefited had the store owner not spent money repairing a window but rather been free to spend his money as he chose similarly the beneficiaries of exim are visible to all what is not seen is the products that would have been built the businesses that would have been started and the jobs that would have been created had the funds used for exim been left in the hands of consumers leaving those funds in the private sector ensures that those resources will be put to the use most highly valued by individual consumers in contrast when the government diverts resources into the public sector via programs such as exim their use is determined by bureaucrats and politically powerful special interests resulting in a distorted market and a misallocation of resources by distorting the market and preventing resources from achieving their highest valued use exim actually costs americans jobs and reduces americas standard of living finally i would like to remind my colleagues that there is simply no constitutional justification for the expenditure of funds on programs such as exim in fact the framers of the constitution would be horrified to know that the federal government was taking hardearned money from the american people in order to benefit the politically powerful in conclusion exim distorts the market by allowing government bureaucrats to make economic decisions instead of individual consumers exim also violates basic principles of morality by forcing american taxpayers to subsidize the operations of wealthy companies that could easily afford to engage in international trade without government assistance exim also violates the limitations on congressional power to take the property of individual citizens and use it to benefit powerful special interests it is for these reasons that i strongly urge my colleagues to reject h r 2072"]]}
