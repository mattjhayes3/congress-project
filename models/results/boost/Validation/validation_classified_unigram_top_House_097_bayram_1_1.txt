do you disagree with the assessment of roman catholic archbishop rivera of san salvador that the guerrillas are now rejected by a majority of people in el salvador because they tend toward the conquest of power for its own sake third do you agree or disagree with the el salvadoran governments practice of land reform fourth since all of these critics bring up the vietnam tragedy let me ask

federal tax rates on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by cosponsoring the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "a couple of weeks ago when we had a bill dealing

that if this section remains in the bill in the other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them

deficiencies now that the soviets have had a decade of massive military buildup behind them now that they are ahead frankly in many areas of nuclear and conventional capability leonid brezhnev says that now the soviet union is prepared to accept a nuclear weapon freeze let me say i am not suggesting that the gentleman from iowa or the gentleman from new york is buying the brezhnev line sorry to even bring it up but he has suggested that a weapon freeze would be good for his country at this point i think that we must first make sure that our good intentions do not lure this country into a position of inferiority thereby precluding us ultimately from reaching the goal that the gentleman from iowa would like to see which is to reduce armaments and to bring about a more stable nuclear balance in the world i know that there are many in the united states who believe that the soviet union is genuinely interested in fair and equitable arms control agreements we have had about a decade of negotiating with them and frankly as a past congressional representative at the salt talksnot that i am an expert but i have sat in several sessions in genevai have never found a more disingenuous set of negotiators than those from the soviet union we should not gamble away the defense of the united states and the attempt by this country to prevent a nuclear war on the good intentions of the soviet union the gentleman from illinois pointed out that if we were to freeze weapon production now we would end up canceling our mx b1 trident trident d5 missile and the c31 modernization programs among others we would we perpetuating some of the vulnerabilities in our forces and conceding strategic domi nance to the soviet union all in the hope that sometime in the future they would be willing to join with us in arms reductions twenty years ago this month presi dent kennedy warned against trusting the soviet commitment to arms control saying to us we know enough now about broken negotiations by the soviet unionsecret preparations and the advantages that they gain from a long test seriesnever to offer again an uninspected moratorium it seems to me that the events in af ghanistan and poland and ethiopia and angola and soviet involvement in central america and elsewhere in the world should be telling us something about with whom we are negotiating and should instill in us a sense of cau tion as i have said in the beginning of my remarks the president wants i believe to preserve peace to insure it for the future and says that we should not just freeze the production of nuclear armswe should be reducing them i agree with him i believe that rather than freezing existing inequities we should concentrate all of our efforts in achieving strategic arms reductions to equal verifiable levels we should seek an agreement that will reduce the nuclear arsenals on both sides to equal levels in a manner that would promote stability and reduce the risk of nuclear war ind to the extent that this debate may contrib ute to that goal i commend my friend from iowa and my friend from new york and thank them for their indulgence"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "well i thank the distinguished majority leader i might also make the observation that when we had an exchange earlier with respect to this coming week we were not sure whether or not members would have monday and tuesday off or the latter part of the week while i think the speaker would have preferred that the order be reversed it is a question of facilitating the legislative committees that are involved here and i might add that there would be a slight possibility too of the budget resolution coming up in the latter part of the week where there would be absolutely no opportunity for that to be considered the first part i would further make the observation that we want to have the rules committee meet on next friday for the continuing resolution so that that would be made in order hopefully for the

on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by cosponsoring the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a couple of weeks ago when we had a bill dealing with the ftc before this body there was a great clamor raised by a group called common cause which calls itself a publicinterest group common cause complained that some of our members had received campaign contributions from a group that had an interest in that bill and wanted to spread that information on the record i think that is a good thing i think that the broader and more prominent disclsoure of campaign contributions we have the better it is for our democracy so i endorse that sort of disclosure even through i do not happen to endorse common causes conclusion that group has a sort of devil theory of history it believes that there is a corrupting relationship between contributions and votes but in the interest of complete disclosure and because common cause indulges in selective disclosure i would like to readesome totals

body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the military knowing they are going to leave at a certain time most of them are preparing for that date as a matter of fact most of them use their last days of leave or they use the service training they are getting in service to prepare for when they leave there is no necessity in making a payment to these people when they are leaving their
