{"top_correct": [[0.0, 0.0, 0, "1 would like to change the focus of debate on this budget resolution thus far from one of emphasis on the cut in spending to one of emphasis on cutting taxes i really believe that the votes we are going to cast next tuesday and wednesday on the various substitutes to the budget resolution may well be the most important votes we will cast in this congress i would like to explain why this first budget resolution sets these aggregate target levels for spending and for revenues although technically they my well not be binding lthe point ils the committee on ways and means on which i serve is not going to cut taxes any less than or any more than is allowed by this budget resolution and most certainly not any more than this level therefore if we adopt a budget resolution that does not allow any cut in taxes there will not be any or if we adopt a budget resolution like the budget committee has put forward that allows less of a tax cut then we are seeking in the orammlatta substitute then we are going to be bound by those terms as well so as a practical matter the committee on ways and means is not going to send a tax cut bill to the floor that cuts taxes any more than this first budget resolution will allow as a theoretical matter tha~t is really the way it ought to be i agree with the chairman of the budget committee in this regard if the budget process means anything this first budget resolution ought to mean something in the past in the four terms i have been in thishouse i have seen time and time again passage of budget resolutions without their meaning anything nobody paid any attention whatsoever to those figures we really ought to if the budget process is going to mean anything as a practical matter we will as far as the committee on ways and means is concenied therefore this is why i say these votes on substitutes and the resolution next tuesday and wednesday are really going to be the most important votes we cast in this congress the most important issue facing this congress is that of the economy the most important votes we are going to have occur on whether or not we are going to implemhent a program the president of the united states has presented to the congress for economic recovery therefore if we wing or injure or handicap or cripple what we are going to be able to subsequently do in the area of tax cuts in part~icular by this budget resolution then we are in effecting winging or handicapping this economic program one of the four parts of the economic recovery program of the president is a sound tax cut program l this tax cut programs life depends upon this budget resolution we are going to adopt basically if we look at what we are hearing in the committee on ways and means i agree wholeheartily with the president of thie united states that we must have a responsible and substantive tax cut program to help solve our economic problems one of the real problems we are having today is that of productivity last year the productivity of the united states was almost dead last when compared to other major industrial nations and for the first time in recent history productivity in this country did not go up it actually declined in 1980 when you have declining productivity your efficiency is going down the ability to produce goods and services is going down in terms of competition with foreign count~ries and in terms of any kind of real growth in this country which means inflation as it costs more to produce something that is inflation as you produce less of something in comparison to foreign competition that is inflation an ople work less hard because there is no incentive because you are not taking home any more money because of high tax rates that is inflation so basically what we believe land strongly believe is that the only real way we can address this problem of productivity is to cut taxes in a meaningful way to cut taxes to make it possible to improve productivity now we do that in this fashion the reason we have to cut these taxes is to mak~e capital available i think everybody understands that the way you retool or modernize a factory the way you have a plant expand and the way to create jobs and the way you are able to keep up with japanese competition in steel and automobiles is to spend money or capital on these factories and these plants where does this capital come from you cannot expect businesses and individuals today to borrow money not at 15 percent and the prime rate continuing to climb as a matter of fact the amount of money american business is borrowing is unhealthy they ought to be generating that capital in aftertax income we oughtto be encouraging individuals to invest money and this is not true under the current tax situation we have in this country so basically if we cut tax rates we generate capital rm aing with the individual who can tnivest money received in a tax cut and put it back i the depository institutions in this country where we need it to lower interest rates we let business have additional profits after their taxes as they will be able to plow capital back into their businesses to retool and modernize there is a new wrinkle we ought to think about too as we reduce the individual tax burden we are letting the taxpayer see he has more after tax income than before and just maybe he will work a little bit harder how many people do we know now who take off a full days work because they are paying too much in taxes in my part of the country a lot of folks will take off for deer hunting season and not work for a month or two because it costs too much to werk they can make almost as much on food stamps and unemployment compensation as they can working and paying taxes as long as we h ave that kind of situation existing in this country we are going to have iflation and low productivity we have to make it possible for people to make more money and keep more of what they earn the same thing is true of the business community to be able to invest that capital to be able to retool modernize our industrial base to keep up with the japanese and germans and to also be able to have people see it pays more to work than it does to play so we have to have capital to solve our problems of productivity and productivity is one of the biggest solutions to our problem of inflation in the year 1980 according to an artide i read the other day in my home town newspaper taxes on a family making about 30 000 a year a family of four went up 25 percent by virtue of their federal tax burdensin 1 year 25 percent in 1965 only 7 percent of all of our taxpayers paid the marginal tax rate of more than 25 percent by 1977 that figure had grown from 7 percent to 30 percent of the american people who were paying more than this because of bracket creep and because of tax increase~s these dual perils are continuing to push more and miore of our taxpayers into higher tax brackets with no more real income to spend by virtue of inflation and these tax increases individuals need a tax break in this country they need it to be able to work harder they need it to be able to make ends meet and they need it out of a spirit of fairness but what i am contending goes beyond that we must have these tax cuts to actually make it possible for our economy to grow and to expand and to hire more people and take care of the people in this country who are less fortunate and have no opportuni ties as the gentleman spoke so eloquently about a mioment ago now if we look at what we have to vote on next tuesday and wednesd~ay in light of the need for tax cuts this might color our final decision first of all we have the substitute by the gentleman from the district of columbia"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "15 months ago we inaugurated a new presidenta new president who brought a vigorous new approach to the solutions of the problems confronting this nation and the world by their votes the people of this nation indicated they wanted a change in direction and this president offered a change he promised to try and reduce federal spending he promised to try to cut the destructive high inflation rate he promised to reduce the unwarranted and unnecessary federal interference in our daily lives with the help in some cases reluctant help of the 535 members of congress this president has made a new beginning he was not able to reduce federal spending but he did cut my more than half the request for increased federal spending he was not able to eliminate all the unnecessary redtape but he was able to reduce the number of pages of regulations printed in the federal register from 73 000 to 51 000 he was not able to end inflation but he did cut the rate which had been in double digit figures for most of the previous administration down to an annualized rate in the month of march of less than 4 percent for the past 5 or 6 months we have been provided with a consistent diet of bad news the morning newspaper headlines and the evening television news emphasize what they perceive to be wrong with the presidents program and ignore what many common folk perceive to be right with the presidents program nowhere has this consistent criticism of the reagan administration been more pernicious than it has been in the reports of central and latin america and particularly the reports from el salvador now i call your attention to some good news and to underscore the importance of this good news permit me to review in some detail what has been going on in el salvador mr speaker in land area this nation is about the size of your own state of massachusetts it is bordered by guatemala on the north honduras on the east and nicaragua on the southeast with about 135 miles of frontage on the pacific ocean about 5 million people live in el salvador el salvador became independent of spain in 1821 and of the central american federation in 1841 about 10 percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and different attitude toward the role of the federal government in our everyday lives is a remarkable change we spent billions to create the great society and are we better off for all that public money spent the crime rate in evcry category is up we spent billions of public money in the war on poverty there is still great misery and poverty in this country the reagan administration understands that you cannot give somebody something without ultimately destroying the recipient of your

august 23 1939 offered to nazi germany a welcome pretense for starting world war ii and allowed parts of eastern europe including the three baltic nationsestonia latvia and lithuaniato become part of soviet russias socalled sphere of influence consequently stalin received a free hand to forcibly annex these three independent baltic countries which remain illegally occupied by the unitedstatess r to this day soon after the conclusion of this pact estonia signed on september 28 1930 under military threat and without the possibility of any help from aboard a pact of mutual assistance with the soviet union during the period of 20 years which the estonian people enjoyed their independence they demonstrated what a small nation is able to achieve in all fields while enjoying a democratic way of life they achieved an exceptionally high educational level the history of estonian literature was documented by the publication of the first book in the estonian language in 1935 the estonian people may also be particularly proud of their agricultural accomplishments and impressive industrial achievements during this time their folklore continues to win recognition for its originality colorful variety and great artistic value as a result of the soviet invasion in 1940 this prosperous life came to an abrupt end by the brutal acts of their large totalitarian neighbor since then the estonian people have suffered extremely heavy human and material losses this situation still persists estonia is economically exploited by the moscow legime those who dare make any requests for freedom and justice relying on the stipulations of the helsinki final act are either confined to mental hospitals or sentenced to prison terms one case in particular that of mart niklus an estonian scientist is typical of those whose only crime is a desire to join their relatives outside the unitedstatess r mart niklus has been harassed by soviet authorities for 22 years and arrested numerous times imprisoned and refused permission to emigrate to sweden to join his family mart niklus was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years for writing and circulating materials related to among other

commitments with respect to the protection of human rights nevertheless many estonians have managed to flee from the communist terror in their homeland and are now living in various parts of the free

like to change the focus of debate on this budget resolution thus far from one of emphasis on the cut in spending to one of emphasis on cutting taxes i really believe that the votes we are going to cast next tuesday and wednesday on the various substitutes to the budget resolution may well be the most important votes we will cast in this congress i would like to explain why this first budget resolution sets these aggregate target levels for spending and for revenues although technically they my well not be binding lthe point ils the committee on ways and means on which i serve is not going to cut taxes any less than or any more than is allowed by this budget resolution and most certainly not any more than this level therefore if we adopt a budget resolution that does not allow any cut in taxes there will not be any or if we adopt a budget resolution like the budget committee has put forward that allows less of a tax cut then we are seeking in the orammlatta substitute then we are going to be bound by those terms as well so as a practical matter the committee on ways and means is not going to send a tax cut bill to the floor that cuts taxes any more than this first budget resolution will allow as a theoretical matter tha~t is really the way it ought to be i agree with the chairman of the budget committee in this regard if the budget process means anything this first budget resolution ought to mean something in the past in the four terms i have been in thishouse i have seen time and time again passage of budget resolutions without their meaning anything nobody paid any attention whatsoever to those figures we really ought to if the budget process is going to mean anything as a practical matter we will as far as the committee on ways and means is concenied therefore this is why i say these votes on substitutes and the resolution next tuesday and wednesday are really going to be the most important votes we cast in this congress the most important issue facing this congress is that of the economy the most important votes we are going to have occur on whether or not we are going to implemhent a program the president of the united states has presented to the congress for economic recovery therefore if we wing or injure or handicap or cripple what we are going to be able to subsequently do in the area of tax cuts in part~icular by this budget resolution then we are in effecting winging or handicapping this economic program one of the four parts of the economic recovery program of the president is a sound tax cut program l this tax cut programs life depends upon this budget resolution we are going to adopt basically if we look at what we are hearing in the committee on ways and means i agree wholeheartily with the president of thie united states that we must have a responsible and substantive tax cut program to help solve our economic problems one of the real problems we are having today is that of productivity last year the productivity of the united states was almost dead last when compared to other major industrial nations and for the first time in recent history productivity in this country did not go up it actually declined in 1980 when you have declining productivity your efficiency is going down the ability to produce goods and services is going down in terms of competition with foreign count~ries and in terms of any kind of real growth in this country which means inflation as it costs more to produce something that is inflation as you produce less of something in comparison to foreign competition that is inflation an ople work less hard because there is no incentive because you are not taking home any more money because of high tax rates that is inflation so basically what we believe land strongly believe is that the only real way we can address this problem of productivity is to cut taxes in a meaningful way to cut taxes to make it possible to improve productivity now we do that in this fashion the reason we have to cut these taxes is to mak~e capital available i think everybody understands that the way you retool or modernize a factory the way you have a plant expand and the way to create jobs and the way you are able to keep up with japanese competition in steel and automobiles is to spend money or capital on these factories and these plants where does this capital come from you cannot expect businesses and individuals today to borrow money not at 15 percent and the prime rate continuing to climb as a matter of fact the amount of money american business is borrowing is unhealthy they ought to be generating that capital in aftertax income we oughtto be encouraging individuals to invest money and this is not true under the current tax situation we have in this country so basically if we cut tax rates we generate capital rm aing with the individual who can tnivest money received in a tax cut and put it back i the depository institutions in this country where we need it to lower interest rates we let business have additional profits after their taxes as they will be able to plow capital back into their businesses to retool and modernize there is a new wrinkle we ought to think about too as we reduce the individual tax burden we are letting the taxpayer see he has more after tax income than before and just maybe he will work a little bit harder how many people do we know now who take off a full days work because they are paying too much in taxes in my part of the country a lot of folks will take off for deer hunting season and not work for a month or two because it costs too much to werk they can make almost as much on food stamps and unemployment compensation as they can working and paying taxes as long as we h ave that kind of situation existing in this country we are going to have iflation and low productivity we have to make it possible for people to make more money and keep more of what they earn the same thing is true of the business community to be able to invest that capital to be able to retool modernize our industrial base to keep up with the japanese and germans and to also be able to have people see it pays more to work than it does to play so we have to have capital to solve our problems of productivity and productivity is one of the biggest solutions to our problem of inflation in the year 1980 according to an artide i read the other day in my home town newspaper taxes on a family making about 30 000 a year a family of four went up 25 percent by virtue of their federal tax burdensin 1 year 25 percent in 1965 only 7 percent of all of our taxpayers paid the marginal tax rate of more than 25 percent by 1977 that figure had grown from 7 percent to 30 percent of the american people who were paying more than this because of bracket creep and because of tax increase~s these dual perils are continuing to push more and miore of our taxpayers into higher tax brackets with no more real income to spend by virtue of inflation and these tax increases individuals need a tax break in this country they need it to be able to work harder they need it to be able to make ends meet and they need it out of a spirit of fairness but what i am contending goes beyond that we must have these tax cuts to actually make it possible for our economy to grow and to expand and to hire more people and take care of the people in this country who are less fortunate and have no opportuni ties as the gentleman spoke so eloquently about a mioment ago now if we look at what we have to vote on next tuesday and wednesd~ay in light

presidenta new president who brought a vigorous new approach to the solutions of the problems confronting this nation and the world by their votes the people of this nation indicated they wanted a change in direction and this president offered a change he promised to try and reduce federal spending he promised to try to cut the destructive high inflation rate he promised to reduce the unwarranted and unnecessary federal interference in our daily lives with the help in some cases reluctant help of the 535 members of congress this president has made a new beginning he was not able to reduce federal spending but he did cut my more than half the request for increased federal spending he was not able to eliminate all the unnecessary redtape but he was able to reduce the number of pages of regulations printed in the federal register from 73 000 to 51 000 he was not able to end inflation but he did cut the rate which had been in double digit figures for most of the previous administration down to an annualized rate in the month of march of less than 4 percent for the past 5 or 6 months we have been provided with a consistent diet of bad news the morning newspaper headlines and the evening television news emphasize what they perceive to be wrong with the presidents program and ignore what many common folk perceive to be right with the presidents program nowhere has this consistent criticism of the reagan administration been more pernicious than it has been in the reports of central and latin america and particularly the reports from el salvador now i call your attention to some good news and to underscore the importance of this good news permit me to review in some detail what has been going on in el salvador mr speaker in land area this nation is about the size of your own state of massachusetts it is bordered by guatemala on the north honduras on the east and nicaragua on the southeast with about 135 miles of frontage on the pacific ocean about 5 million people live in el salvador el salvador became independent of spain in 1821 and of the central american federation in 1841 about 10 percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and different attitude toward the role of the federal government in our everyday lives is a remarkable change we spent billions to create the great society and are we better off for all that public money spent the crime rate in evcry category is up we spent billions of public money in the war on poverty there is still great misery and poverty in this country the reagan administration understands that you cannot give somebody something without ultimately destroying the recipient of your gift the reagan administration is determined to get the government out of the way and to encourage the individuals to be responsible for their own destiny with an assist for all those who are

however during this war of independence estonia repulsed the red armies and in 1920 concluded a peace treaty with the soviet union unfortunately the signing of the notorious stalinhitler pact of august 23 1939 offered to nazi germany a welcome pretense for starting world war ii and allowed parts of eastern europe including the three baltic nationsestonia latvia and lithuaniato become part of soviet russias socalled sphere of influence consequently stalin received a free hand to forcibly annex these three independent baltic countries which remain illegally occupied by the unitedstatess r to this day soon after the conclusion of this pact estonia signed on september 28 1930 under military threat and without the possibility of any help from aboard a pact of mutual assistance with the soviet union during the period of 20 years which the estonian people enjoyed their independence they demonstrated what a small nation is able to achieve in all fields while enjoying a democratic way of life they achieved an exceptionally high educational level the history of estonian literature was documented by the publication of the first book in the estonian language in 1935 the estonian people may also be particularly proud of their agricultural accomplishments and impressive industrial achievements during this time their folklore continues to win recognition for its originality colorful variety and great artistic value as a result of the soviet invasion in 1940 this prosperous life came to an abrupt end by the brutal acts of their large totalitarian neighbor since then the estonian people have suffered extremely heavy human and material losses this situation still persists estonia is economically exploited by the moscow legime those who dare make any requests for freedom and justice relying on the stipulations of the helsinki final act are either confined to mental hospitals or sentenced to prison terms one case in particular that of mart niklus an estonian scientist is typical of those whose only crime is a desire to join their relatives outside the unitedstatess r mart niklus has been harassed by soviet authorities for 22 years and arrested numerous times imprisoned and refused permission to emigrate to sweden to join his family mart niklus was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years for writing and circulating materials related to among other things the molotovribbentrop pact and the trial of the chairman of the lithuanian helsinki group and others and for listening to the voice of america i have introduced house concurrent resolution 218

that the united states in evaluating its relations with other countries will take into account the extent to which such countries honor their coinmitments under international law especially commitments with respect to the protection of human rights nevertheless many estonians have managed to flee from the communist terror in their homeland and are now living in various parts of the free world they are deeply concerned about the future of their ancestral homeland and continue to make their voices heard on behalf of the people of estonia the united states as well as a great number of other western countries have never recognized the forcible annexation of estonia latvia and lithuania by the soviet union which is of great moral support to the people of these nations i believe it is especially important for the united states to continue its full and uncompromising support for the basic concept of sovereign rights of a people to the free and independent choice of the form of government under which they wish to live estonians in the united states and throughout the free world will commemorate their national holiday today february 24 they confirm at such occasions their determination to fight for the rtstoration of the independence of their native estonia at the same time they hope that world public opinion will support them in this struggle for freedom and justice
