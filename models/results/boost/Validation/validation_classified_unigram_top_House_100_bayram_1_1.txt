indicated that a united states congressional delegation discussed with top yugoslav defense officials unprecedented military cooperation including the construction of components of united states military hardware in yugoslavia and united states supply of sophisticated military material to enable yugoslavia to modernize its defense forces yugoslav sources explained that they could produce spare parts more cheaply than could united states plants unitedstates assistance to a communist dictatorship would seem selfdefeating but since the allied betrayal of general mihailovich and the forces struggling against the nazi and communist tyrannies in world war ii the united state department has perpetuated the notion that yugoslavia represents communism with a difference in this regard our state department treatment of yugoslav communism is similar to our state department treatment of romania the fiction is preserved that romania too is communism with a difference and despite its horrifying human rights record mostfavorednation treatment is allegedly a way of wooing ceaucescu from the soviet orbit our former ambassador to romania david funderburk in his book pinstripes and reds explodes this myth but not the momentum in the bowels of state that continues to push for such policies the yugoslavs can indeed produce united states military equipment more cheaply than can unitedstates plants workers on the production line at the yugo plant make as little as 25 cents an hour certainly this is a factor behind the anticipated mass strikes in yugoslavia this fall as it should be any american concerned about fair labor standards and unfair trade practices should keep this in mind before considering purchase of a yugo car given this grass exploitation moreover the communist dictators of yugoslavia share another common feature with ceaucescuthey are hopelessly corrupt while ceaucescu sells human beings who want to emigrate the communist officials in yugoslavia who are running state enterprises have fraudulently issued promissory notes to the tune of at least 2 billion for theirown personal h 8288 co gain at the same time what hadbeen the most prosperous and productive country in the balkan region prior to world war i has been transformed by the communists since wwii into a terminal economic patient kept alive through such unitedstates life support systems as commercial and multinational lending institutions and preferential access to unitedstates markets yugoslavias outstanding world debt is pushing 19 billion their inflation rate is well over 100 percent and their unemployment stands at almost 17 percent small wonder then that yugoslav officials would salivate over the prospect of increased business with the united statesat the expense of united state jobs and security one must keep security in mind when dealing with any communist regime yugoslavia for example has maintained training camps for world terrorists have americans forgotten too that the architect of the achille lauro hijacking abu abbas was rescued and provided sanctuary in yugoslavia by that governments secret police this is the same government that sold minisubs to colonel qadhafi to be used against unitedstates ships in the mediterranean and cbs released on unconfirmed report that yugoslavia has sold sophisticated sea mines to the ayatollah khomeini to be used against american vessels in the persian gulf this is totally consistent behavior by an arms supplier to vietnam north korea angola nicaragua and the communist terrorists in el salvador there is also a confirmed report that the yugoslav government is producing sophisticated minirockets designed exclusively for the use of terrorists and it is as naive to believe that any yugoslav access to new technology is not immediately transferred to the soviet union as it is to believe that ceaucescu does not serve as an immediate conduit for the soviets if all of this were not enough the peoples militia in yugoslavia has responded to protests by everyone from students and intellectuals to workers and minorities with brutal repression in the kosovo region the governments actions amount to genocide and thoughout all of this our state department pursues a policy of silence and promotion of the fiction that this is communism with a difference zlatan stamenich chairman of the yugoslav commission for human rights in the united states if a former member of general mikailovichs army of the fatherland which heroically resisted the nazi invasion of yugoslavia chairman stamenich reluctantly abandoned his homeland at the end of world war ii because to him the wall between black nazis and red nazis was indistinguishable but his dream for the ultimate realization of a free yugoslavia a yugoslavia that fulfills general mihailovichs expressed hopes for democracy and human rights observance in a postwar world remains undiminished it is for that reason thtt chairman stamenich continues his struggle along with thousands of other expa triats from communist tyranny to alert americans to the truth about the sad fate that has befallen his homeland and especially to open the eyes of the united states state department to its fundamental contradictions in glossing over the realities of contemporary yugoslavia"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "and it is the united states which has

the worlds defense burden the cost of protecting freedom and the free markets should be borne evenly and proportionally by those who benefit from them this resolution gives japan an option if the japanese government feels that it cannot exceed their politically established 1 percent of gross national product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national product on defense last year i must add that i am extremely concerned over the recent export violations by toshiba machine co inc of japan while the united states is spending billions on national security a security that as ive discussed accrues great benefit to the japanese toshiba sold sophisticated propeller manufacturing equipment expressly prohibited by law to the soviet union this sale and unbelievably its accompanying service contract approved by the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti served as a veritable stab in the back of all americans our nation which has stood as the rebuilder and protector of a nation which at one time struck out in a violent act of hostility against our nation 46 years ago views this sale of ship and submarine quieting technology which occurred twice with particular disdain i am pleased to see the substantive steps taken by the japanese to get to the heart of the toshiba problem and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a copy of a recent article by richard perle president reagans former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy regarding the toshiba machine incident h j res 327 joint resolution requiring the president or his designee to enter into negotiations with japan for the purpose of having japan bear a greater share of the free worlds defense burden by either increasing its annual defense expenditures to at least 3 percent of japans gross national product or by obtaining payment by japan to the united states of the difference between 3 percent of japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to protect and augment freedom democracy and capitalism throughout the world the global markets upon which exporting nations depend would not be available whereas the recent developments in the persian gulf bring to light once again the dependence of our allies on the united states for the protection of strategic international sea lanes so vital to the industrialized democracies whereas 37 percent of the oil consumed by the united states 100 percent of the oil consumed by japan 100 percent of the oil consumed by west germany 94 percent of the oil consumed by france and 100 percent of the oil consumed by italy is imported whereas 4 percent of the oil consumed by the united states and 60 percent of the oil consumed by japan passes through the gulf of hormuz whereas there have been disturbing revelations that the japanese company toshiba machine has on two occasions sold strategic technological equipment to the soviet union which gives the soviets the ability to reduce the noise level of their submarines by a factor of twenty significantly undermining the security of the united states and the rest of the free world whereas at a time when the necessary financial commitment to national security is particularly burdensome to the american economy given its increasing national debt the trade deficit relatively high interest rates and the erosion of united states manufacturing jobs this sale with the approval of the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti is looked on with particular disdain whereas in 1985 the united states spent 7 percent of its gnp on defense the soviet union spent 14 percent of its gnp on defense our european allies spent an average 3 5 percent of their gnp on defense and japan spent 1 of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963 trillion in 1986 and had an inflation rate of 1 percent and an unemployment rate of 2 8 percent during the same period whereas the united states overall trade deficit in 1986 was 166 3 billion and 50 billion in the first three months of 1987 and our trade deficit with japan alone was 58 6 billion in 1986 whereas with soviet aggression

competitiveness this years slogan masquerading as a policy the fellows who want to keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic red tapea complaint that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige whose department dispenses red tape by the mile echoes happily at industry lunches and in congressional testimony now if mac would put the time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the western alliance the president who has taken the lead in arguing for effective export controls will appear pale and depleted if he

enough but we arp not really going to get to the crux of the problem until we have a comprehensive approach which involves for the very first time a recognition of the fact that until you change the attitude toward drug users in this country you are not going to change the equation that presently exists i ask simply what is the impact on the young people of today when they see professional football players slapped on the wrist for 30 days and supposedly beginning their drug rehabilitation by playing golf what do they think when they hear on the floor of the house that we should excuse drug traffickers because they happen to be veterans i heard someone ask how can we take a particular benefit away from somebody when their service in vietnam drove them to trafficking in drugs is that the message you want to send forward do you want to send a message forward that in a courtroom in america that if someone is a drug trafficker they can say they got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore they are excused i am concerned about veterans of america and concerned about the vietnam veterans but more concerned about the young people of america today in this respect what i heard on the floor is that if a trafficker sells drugs to my son or your son or grandson that person ought to receive special treatment because that person happened to be a veteran we made an exemption because we understood the problem of drug usage among some that returned from vietnam you do not suffer the same disability under the mccollum amendment if you are merely using drugs and convicted of use if you happen to be a veteran they are therefore given a special exemption but when their action rises to the question of drug trafficking we say that at that we draw the line we dont take away your health benefit we dont take away your retirement benefit we protect those but other types of benefits we are going to subject to penalty why do we do that because we have tried the purely criminal sanction route and we have recognized that is not sufficient we have to send a message that is more than that we have to change the culture of america with respect to usage of drugs that is why the amendment is crucial it goes to the question of true user accountability unfortunately the rangel substitute guts the effectiveness of this crucial amendment this amendment may be more important than any other single amendment we have here because it reflects a change in attitude of our approach on the drug problem we can talk big we can have mandatory penalties but if we excuse the users as we have done time and time again if we now excuse the trafficker because the trafficker happens to be a veteran we are going to send the wrong message to america if we want to save this generation of young people if we want to save the next generation we have to do more than we have done before we have to establish user accountability and that means changing the rules of the game that we have had

at the very least the medical program of the veterans administration should be funded at a current services level this budget resolution falls considerably short of current services and therefore is of groat concern to me the resolution may look all right at first glance on further examination however it is clear that the budget committee has recommended funds for function 700 that places veterans medical care at less than a priority level as compared to a number of other programs the budget committee recommendation figures might indicate to some that they are 250 million over the

treated it means that quality medical care for veterans is in jeopardy it means a diminishing of the historic pledge of this body that it will always assure adequate funds for va medicine the house veterans affairs committee carefully studied the presidents budget and then made recommendations to the budget committee we were unanimous in those recommendations we said that the presidents budget ought to be very modestly amended upward for va medical care and for the administration of veterans benefits we recommended a very modest increase in construction funds to build three more nursing

me from accepting this argument there are now approximately 10 000 radio stations and 1 300 television stations reaching 98 2 percent of all unitedstates households with the availability of home

are only one or twopaper towns yet 96 percent of unitedstates households receive five or more television signals and 71 percent of all households receive nine or more signals in addition there are 7 300 cable systems reaching 46 percent of homes in the united states far from a scarcity the numbers indicate convincingly that the broadcast audience has a great many information alternatives

the availability of opportunities to broadcast programming and the availability of the opportunities to receive programming proponents of this bill have continually focused on the former distinction when the very purposes of the fairness doctrine command that we focus on the latter distinction i am concerned that enacting the fairness doctrine will intrude on the constitutional rights of broadcasters i see the fairness doctrine as a dangerous precedent of government regulation over content government officials should not be dictating broadcast contentthat should be determined solely

bill said he felt badly because there was a democrat president and a democrat congress and that maybe they were responsible in some way i do not feel that at all it was a national policy it was endorsed by most americans and for it as the successors we are all indicted on the other hand if we could magically transport this congress back to those days and under those circumstances my suspicion is that we would do about what that congress did in those days which was nothing i do not think we are any wiser than the congress that was seated at that time however i think it is important to note that none of us here at least as far as i know participated in government at that time even though i suspect we all would have let it happen without objecting to it i think part of

what a contorted way the committee gives us to show how guilty we feel or how embarrassed we are what a funny way they ask us to rub ashes on our heads they are saying that with our current budget situation that our children and grandchildren must pay for mistakes that were made two or three generations before they were born by accepting the debt which the 1 2 billion is going to incur the committee is asking us to purge ourselves of somebody elses guilt with another generations money just think of the enormity of that for a minute it is not anything that we did but because we feel guilty because we have these noble motivations to right some wrongs we are going to give away money indiscriminately without respect to the degree of suffering without respect to whether we take it from the poor and give it to the rich or whatever because we feel a little bit guilty we are going to put the hairshirt on somebody else and that somebody else is our children and our grandchildren and remember they did not make the decision and neither did we make the decisions this seems to me to be a perfectly typical congressional action whenever we feel badly we give away somebody elses money then suddenly we are made whole we are purged and we all feel wonderful well i do not think our constituents feel wonderful about that i do not think if you put this bill to referendum that you would get one objection to admitting guilt i think you would get nearly 100 percent objection to giving away money indiscriminately which the government does not have to people without respect to the degree of claim they have many members have said in no way can we compensate for what we did to these people i believe that is true and i believe in no way should we try to compensate should we try to pay blood money to cleanse this embarrassment or the guilt that we all feel i hate to be curmudgeonly on this subject i always hate to argue against somebody elses bill i find it is a role i am cast into frequently i hate to put my judgment ahead of the people who have studied these things for a long time but for better or for worse that is my job and that is all of our jobs i do not think i am going to feel one bit better after we have given away our grandchildrens money in this way than i do today i am still going to feel that we made a mistake i am still going to hope that we do not make that mistake again but i am not going to feel fulfilled or purged or cleansed at all it is 1 2 billion we do not have that in our budget that means that should we be lucky enough to get a grammrudman bill we will have to make up the 1 2 billion somewhere else maybe we will have to cut it from a grant to somebody who is poor so that we can pay this to a rich person i believe this is an act of

of certain amendments added by the other body to the fair housing amendments act of 1988 my colleagues will recall that the house considered the fair housing legislation on june 22 and june 23 and finally approved the legislation on june 29 subsequently when the housepassed bill went to the other body a series of negotiations ensued to resolve the remaining differences between the civil rights community and the administration our purpose here today is to consider and hopefully accept the changes to h r 1158 adopted by the senate it should be pointed out that these changes have the support of the unitedstates department of housing and urban development the department of justice as well as key elements in the business community principally the national association of realtors and the national association of home builders the amendments adopted in the other body do no harm to the spirit of the balanced compromise approved by this house just a few weeks ago in fact many of these amendments serve to enhance and reinforce some of the provisions contained in that compromise for example many members of this house were concerned about the potential adverse impact that the coverage of families with children could have on senior citizens retirement communities under the language of one notable senate amendment existing senior citizen communities will have increased flexibility and possibility to qualify for the exemption from the familial status requirements just as important is the senateadded language providing a transition period for the current residents of housing that excludes children they will not be required to leave that housing nor will they be subject to eviction that is existing residents whose presence in a community or apartment complex might otherwise cause the community to fall outside the protections in section 807 b 2 will not be counted in calculating whether the exemption should apply the bottom line is that senior citizens retirement communities across the united states will have a greater chance of qualifying for the housing for older persons exemption furthermore no one will be evicted whether in a senior citizens community or an alladult community because of the enactment of this bill litigation authority was also an issue when we considered h r 1158 on this floor approximately 6 weeks ago the language contained in the bill before the house today fully consolidates in the department of justice the authority to represent the federal government in all of the enforcement actions under the fair housing act however while the litigation will be conducted by lawyers from the department of justice the decision as to whether or not prompt judicial action is necessary to obtain injunctive relief or to seek court enforcement of a finding of discriminatirn will still be lodged with the secretary of housing and urban development so under the latest compromise the secretary will decide whether or not litigation should occur where the secretary authorizes the litigation it is transmitted to the attorney general and lie is required to promptly commence and maintain such action consistent with the terms of the senate amendment the amended version of h r 1158 also contains a technical amendment to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies making it clear that certain interim certifications by hud are included in the bill the language adopted in the other body also makes it clear that this legislation is not requiring the establishment of a federal building code because of the accessibility and adaptability requirement for newly constructed multifamlly dwellings these and the other changes made in h r 1158 are improvements and refinements fully consistent with the spirit of the housepassed compromise bill we are in the final stretch run of a circuitous race that began nearly 10 years ago this bipartisan effortto strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1968 law and expand the coverage of the fair housing protections under title viii of the civil rights acthas tested the stamina of many of us in this house my good friend and distinguished colleague from california civil and constitutional rights subcommittee chairman don edwards in particular is to be commended for his patience determination and effective leadership in this effort we are on the threshold of finally passing a federal fair housing law that is workable and effective thirtysix million disabled persons will receive the protections of this fundamental civil rights statute families with children will no longer be arbitrarily limited in their choice of decent housing the secretary of hud will have new and significant powers to investigate discrimination complaints and to enforce the rights guaranteed under this statute if discrimination is found and proven state and local fair housing agencies will contintic their vital integral role in fair housing enforcement all across the united states the states and localities are given an adequate grace period to bring their statutes and ordinances in line with the new federal law so that they can continue to handle a majority of these fair housing complaints complainants and respondents in fair housing discrimination cases are guaranteed due process rights in administrative proceedings and the fundamental right to a trial by jury in a unitedstates district court in instances where they so elect either the adjudication or the trial that results from the election is intended to be a final decision concerning the claims raised by the aggrieved person or any intervenor the aggrieved person or any intervenor may not relitigate the same claims raised in the complaint or seek additional or alternative relief through a direct action in federal court as was reflected in the colloquy between the gentleman from california and myself during consideration of this legislation in june res judicata applies and the intent is that claims based upon the same set of facts should be consolidated into one case before concluding i want to take this one last opportunity to mention some of the individuals who over the years have made positive and prominent contributions to this effort i have already noted and want to reinforce the tremendous contribution made by the gentleman from california the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner deserves special recognition our thanks go to the secretary of housing and urban development sam pierce for his pivotal role in

deserves acknowledgment and acclaim for his many contributions in addition i also want to give muchdeserved credit to our former colleague and friend from the other body the distinguished senator from maryland charles mcc mathias for many years mac was the principal sponsor of this legislation in the senate and was always ready and willing to lend his time and his advice to this effort pivotal

naacp kerry scanlon of the washington lawyers committee for civil rights under law wade henderson of the aclu and penda hair of the naacp legal defense fund also brought their usual fairness and balance to this effort the compromise that brought about prompt approval of this legislation in the house of representatives just a few weeks ago could never have occurred without the assistance of these and other representatives of the civil rights community their willingness to compromise was the key this is also an appropriate time to give recognition to many of the unsung heroes which you may not read about in the newspapers but nevertheless have made major contributions to the development of this legislation and its prospects for success from the staff of the subcommittee on civil and

with the promise that that money is going to be spent to improve aviation and then we break the promise we break faith with those people we take their money we tax them but we do not spend the money

the free markets should be borne evenly and proportionally by those who benefit from them this resolution gives japan an option if the japanese government feels that it cannot exceed their politically established 1 percent of gross national product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national product on defense last year i must add that i am extremely concerned over the recent export violations by toshiba machine co inc of japan while the united states is spending billions on national security a security that as ive discussed accrues great benefit to the japanese toshiba sold sophisticated propeller manufacturing equipment expressly prohibited by law to the soviet union this sale and unbelievably its accompanying service contract approved by the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti served as a veritable stab in the back of all americans our nation which has stood as the rebuilder and protector of a nation which at one time struck out in a violent act of hostility against our nation 46 years ago views this sale of ship and submarine quieting technology which occurred twice with particular disdain i am pleased to see the substantive steps taken by the japanese to get to the heart of the toshiba problem and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a copy of a recent article by richard perle president reagans former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy regarding the toshiba machine incident h j res 327 joint resolution requiring the president or his designee to enter into negotiations with japan for the purpose of having japan bear a greater share of the free worlds defense burden by either increasing its annual defense expenditures to at least 3 percent of japans gross national product or by obtaining payment by japan to the united states of the difference between 3 percent of japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to protect and augment freedom democracy and capitalism throughout the world the global markets upon which exporting nations depend would not be available whereas the recent developments in the persian gulf bring to light once again the dependence of our allies on the united states for the protection of strategic international sea lanes so vital to the industrialized democracies whereas 37 percent of the oil consumed by the united states 100 percent of the oil consumed by japan 100 percent of the oil consumed by west germany 94 percent of the oil consumed by france and 100 percent of the oil consumed by italy is imported whereas 4 percent of the oil consumed by the united states and 60 percent of the oil consumed by japan passes through the gulf of hormuz whereas there have been disturbing revelations that the japanese company toshiba machine has on two occasions sold strategic technological equipment to the soviet union which gives the soviets the ability to reduce the noise level of their submarines by a factor of twenty significantly undermining the security of the united states and the rest of the free world whereas at a time when the necessary financial commitment to national security is particularly burdensome to the american economy given its increasing national debt the trade deficit relatively high interest rates and the erosion of united states manufacturing jobs this sale with the approval of the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti is looked on with particular disdain whereas in 1985 the united states spent 7 percent of its gnp on defense the soviet union spent 14 percent of its gnp on defense our european allies spent an average 3 5 percent of their gnp on defense and japan spent 1 of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963 trillion in 1986 and had an inflation rate of 1 percent and an unemployment rate of 2 8 percent during the same period whereas the united states overall trade deficit in 1986 was 166 3 billion and 50

executive agencies as the department of commerce to weaken export controls is lumbering forward behind the banner of competitiveness this years slogan masquerading as a policy the fellows who want to keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic red tapea complaint that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige whose department dispenses red tape by the mile echoes happily at industry lunches and in congressional testimony now if mac would put the time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the western alliance the president who has taken the lead in arguing for effective export controls will appear pale and depleted if he falls to take charge of the kongsbergtoshlba affair and abandoning

until we have a comprehensive approach which involves for the very first time a recognition of the fact that until you change the attitude toward drug users in this country you are not going to change the equation that presently exists i ask simply what is the impact on the young people of today when they see professional football players slapped on the wrist for 30 days and supposedly beginning their drug rehabilitation by playing golf what do they think when they hear on the floor of the house that we should excuse drug traffickers because they happen to be veterans i heard someone ask how can we take a particular benefit away from somebody when their service in vietnam drove them to trafficking in drugs is that the message you want to send forward do you want to send a message forward that in a courtroom in america that if someone is a drug trafficker they can say they got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore they are excused i am concerned about veterans of america and concerned about the vietnam veterans but more concerned about the young people of america today in this respect what i heard on the floor is that if a trafficker sells drugs to my son or your son or grandson that person ought to receive special treatment because that person happened to be a veteran we made an exemption because we understood the problem of drug usage among some that returned from vietnam you do not suffer the same disability under the mccollum amendment if you are merely using drugs and convicted of use if you happen to be a veteran they are therefore given a special exemption but when their action rises to the question of drug trafficking we say that at that we draw the line we dont take away your health benefit we dont take away your retirement benefit we protect those but other types of benefits we are going to subject to penalty why do we do that because we have tried the purely criminal sanction route and we have recognized that is not sufficient we have to send a message that is more than that we have to change the culture of america with respect to usage of drugs that is why the amendment is crucial it goes to the question of true user accountability unfortunately the rangel substitute guts the effectiveness of this crucial amendment this amendment may be more important than any other single amendment we have here because it reflects a change in attitude of our approach on the drug problem we can talk big we can have mandatory penalties but if we excuse the users as we have done time and time again if we now excuse the trafficker because the trafficker happens to be a veteran we are going to send the wrong message to america if we want to save this generation of young people if we want to save the next generation we have to do more than we have done before we have to establish user accountability and that means changing the rules of the game that we have had thus far is this something new absolutely the reason it is new is because we

be funded at a current services level this budget resolution falls considerably short of current services and therefore is of groat concern to me the resolution may look all right at first glance on further examination however it is clear that the budget committee has recommended funds for function 700 that places veterans medical care at less than a priority level as compared to a number of other programs the budget committee recommendation figures might indicate to some that they are 250 million over the presidents reestimated request for budget authority and budget outlays on closer

relates to another 150 mil lion this 300 million in turn relates to a loss of about 3 000 employees in vas department of medicine and surgery this budget committee report is a far cry from current services for va medicine it means that va will treat fewer outpatients next year it means that fewer inpatients will be treated it means that quality medical care for veterans is in jeopardy it means a diminishing of the historic pledge of this body that it will always assure adequate funds for va medicine the house veterans affairs committee carefully studied the presidents budget and then made recommendations to the budget committee we were unanimous in those recommendations we said that the presidents budget ought to be very modestly amended upward for va medical care and for the administration of veterans benefits we recommended a very modest increase in construction funds to build three more nursing homes to try to take care of aging veterans we wanted to start work on a badly needed clinical addition and spinal cord injury unit at dallas tx we rejected a 1percent projected increase in productivity in va hospitals and clinics because medical care is just not measured

that came before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee during the recent hearing conducted on this legislation i was struck by one overriding impression the codification of the fairness doctrine cannot be justified unless one accepts the spectrum scarcity rationale sheer weight of numbers prevents me from accepting this argument there are now approximately 10 000 radio stations and 1 300 television stations reaching 98 2 percent of all unitedstates households with the availability of home dishes cable vcrs and microwave technology there are numerous sources of information for broadcast audiences to choose from although no one is even suggesting that we consider applying the fairness doctrine to newspapers it is interesting to contrast the broadcast numbers with the figures for the print media for example there are only 1 700 daily newspapers in this country and many major cities are only one or twopaper towns yet 96 percent of unitedstates households receive five or more television signals and 71 percent of all households receive nine or more signals in addition there are 7 300 cable systems reaching 46 percent of homes in the united states far from a scarcity the numbers indicate convincingly that the broadcast audience has a great many information alternatives available as my good friend the gentleman from iowa perceptively pointed out at the subcommittee hearing on h r 1934 in considering the spectrum scarcity rationale a distinction must be made between the availability of opportunities to broadcast programming and the availability of the opportunities to receive programming proponents of this bill have continually focused on the former distinction when the very purposes of the fairness doctrine command that we focus on the latter distinction i am concerned that enacting the fairness doctrine will intrude on the constitutional rights of broadcasters i see the fairness doctrine as a dangerous precedent of government

ashes on our heads they are saying that with our current budget situation that our children and grandchildren must pay for mistakes that were made two or three generations before they were born by accepting the debt which the 1 2 billion is going to incur the committee is asking us to purge ourselves of somebody elses guilt with another generations money just think of the enormity of that for a minute it is not anything that we did but because we feel guilty because we have these noble motivations to right some wrongs we are going to give away money indiscriminately without respect to the degree of suffering without respect to whether we take it from the poor and give it to the rich or whatever because we feel a little bit guilty we are going to put the hairshirt on somebody else and that somebody else is our children and our grandchildren and remember they did not make the decision and neither did we make the decisions this seems to me to be a perfectly typical congressional

do not think if you put this bill to referendum that you would get one objection to admitting guilt i think you would get nearly 100 percent objection to giving away money indiscriminately which the

we made a mistake i am still going to hope that we do not make that mistake again but i am not going to feel fulfilled or purged or cleansed at all it is 1 2 billion we do not have that in our budget that means that should we be lucky enough to get a grammrudman bill we will have to make up the 1 2 billion somewhere else maybe we will have to cut it from a grant to somebody who is poor so that we
