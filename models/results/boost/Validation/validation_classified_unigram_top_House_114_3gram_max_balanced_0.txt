have been quoted when you hear about 380 million gallons a day of sewage being dumped in this estuary that they talk about this environment they are trying to protect when you think about that much sewage being dumped into the delta on a daily basis you hear the same people talking about trying to protect it there are things going on in that delta and they have been restricting our water for the last 20 years and it has not saved that species there are provisions in these bills that actually help we attacked the invasive species that is attacking the delta smelt the striped bass we have offered that provision many times we are offering many solutions like the author mentioned earlier we have had language in probably five different pieces of legislation going through the house over to the senate we have begged for an open and transparent process where we can debate this and have some commonsense ideas brought forward and voted and signed into law so that we can help both our communities if you truly care about the delta stop polluting it if you truly care about the people of california and what it costs to feed your families if you truly care about farm workers if you truly care about these small communities you would care about water and doing this right and having an honest debate now i have been approached off camera a million times now to have another offcamera conversation about this and we have said all along no more conversation like that everything on the floor this is an open transparent process five pieces of legislation have this language in it and we are going to continue to push until we can get some support so we can fix this problem so those little communities in my district that people claim to care about could actually turn on a faucet and fill a pot of water so they can make themselves some food to eat and some dinner maybe bathe their children because that is where we are today we have houses that when they turn on a faucet they no longer have water and i get the whole junior water rights concern but if they were truly concerned about the environment they would give up some of their water but you look at hetch hetchy that has had 100 percent of their water and continues to deliver that water via pipeline all the way to san francisco without one conversation about that water being able to help some of these rivers and some of these species but they are not willing to give up any of their water they are willing to take other peoples water it is the same thing we hear about on so many different issues take someone elses product or someone elses water and try to solve another problem with it and the problem has to be solved the right way language that we have offered that has been offered into these amendments into these bills and that we have pushed over to the senate and the conversation has to be had in an open transparent process like our senators have told us they wanted so we are here we are ready for that conversation we want an honest debate and we want to talk about the way we actually fix these problems we are not going to try to accommodate communities dumping their sewage in the delta but we want to help those species and there is language in there to do that even language in there to help capture some of the water use some of the infrastructure we have paid for as taxpayers and allow it to be used to its full capacity so we can continue to store water that we do have and not waste it this is an honest piece of language that could actually help solve californias problems and i think we need

the families were informed that their loved ones were to be released in the town square when the excited families arrived for their longawaited reunion their sons were hanged before their eyes a doctor told me of his college days in paris he called home to tell his brother in tehran of an antikhomeini demonstration his brother was promptly arrested tortured and imprisoned for simply listening

expatriates i spoke with tell me the same thing the economic sanctions and international isolation of the regime were bringing iran to the brink of revolution and this brings us to the presidents negotiation with irans fascist islamic regime any agreement between irans leaders and the united states is meaningless because irans leaders word is meaningless irans government is a notoriously untrustworthy rogue state that has made it unmistakably clear that it intends to acquire nuclear weapons and once acquired to use them the only way to avert this nightmare short of war is for the regime to collapse from within over the last several years the iranian opposition has grown dramatically for two reasons there is a strong and growing perception among the iranian people that the iranian dictatorship is a pariah in the international community and the resulting international economic sanctions have created conditions that make the regimes overthrow imperative at precisely this moment in history barack obama did incalculable damage by initiating these negotiations by engaging this rogue state president obama has given it international recognition and legitimacy at just that moment when it had lost legitimacy in the eyes of its own people worse by promising relief from economic sanctions he has removed the most compelling reason the organized iranian resistance had to justify the regimes overthrow it is not the outcome of the negotiations that matters because any agreement with irans conniving leaders is meaningless it is the negotiations themselves that have greatly strengthened the regime just when it was most vulnerable from growing opposition among its own people now the house just passed h r 1191 that purports to restore congressional oversight to these talks i believe it completely missed the point first our constitution requires that any treaty be approved by twothirds of the senate well that wasnt going to happen so mr obama simply redefined the prospective treaty as an agreement between leaders an agreement with no force of law and no legal standing i fear the congress has just changed this equation by establishing a wholly extraconstitutional process that lends the imprimatur of congress to these negotiations with no practical way to stop the lifting of sanctions instead of twothirds of the senate having to approve a treaty as the constitution requires this agreement takes effect automatically unless twothirds of both houses reject ita complete sham but worse i fear this bill gives tacit approval to extremely harmful negotiations that congress instead ought to vigorously condemn and unambiguously repudiate we can only hope that in the days ahead what churchill called the parliamentary democracies will regain the national leadership required to prevent these negotiations from producing what amounts to the munich accords for the middle east that will require treating the iranian dictatorship as the international pariah that it is and it will require providing every ounce of moral and material support to the iranian opposition that they need to rid their nation of this fascist islamic

yesterday at a white house press briefing in which he had said that the republicans have no one to blame but themselves so i thought it would be helpful if we looked at the statements he made about the vast amount of crime in america disproportionately being committed by people who are illegally in the united states first the white house spokesman said it includedand he is talking about the presidents bill and how if the house had passed that then all our problems are over and he said about the presidents bill it included a historic investment in border security well let me help obviously he is just not up on what the law said he hadnt read it as i had but what it did is it set forward a plan to have a plan made by homeland security within so many months it has been a good while since i looked at it but they had all kinds of time to put together a plan and then that would be looked at by gao the government accountability office as i recall and then they had so much time a vast amount of time to analyze that to see if the situational awareness and occupational control would be adequate under the plan that was being proposed by homeland security the very people that have not secured the border so far and then as time went on i believe at the end of 5 years it got really serious if the border occupational control and situational awareness were not adequate then there was a real tough penalty and that was that the i believe it was secretary of homeland security had to give a report on why it was not adequately controlled look the senate bill was a disaster it did nothing to control our border it was the same kind of gobbledygook we have been dealing with for quite some time from the white house and we have said consistently as republicans in this house most of us if the president will secure the border we will pass an immigration bill that takes care of everything else it is pretty basic secure the border then we will deal with the people that are here illegally until the border is secured then you are going to keep having people like juan francisco lopezsanchez coming back across so it wont matter how expansive a bill is and how much situational awareness there is on our borders or in our country it wont matter because people like mr lopezsanchez will keep coming back we have got to have border security that is all there is to it once the border is secure we can work everything else out and i pointed out many times what i have learned on the border what i have heard repeatedly from our immigration officers our border patrolmen that they are not allowed to properly secure the border we had this massive influx of people coming in and apparently it is expected to grow some more again this year but we are not securing the border we let them come in and once they are on our side of the border then we go ahead and ship them off this had been going on for some time one of the border patrolmen told me that among the drug cartels and the gangs in mexico the homeland security department is called logistics after the commercial i forget if it is fedex or ups one of them that say hey we are the logistics you give us your package and then we get it wherever you want it to go i asked just in the last couple of weeks the secretary of homeland security are you still shipping people all over the place i didnt get an adequate answer i am afraid the answer is there is still the logistics we wont stop you at the border if you come across the river we are not going to have people out there at the river to stop you from coming onto united states property now we are going to let you get onto united states property and then we are going to take you where you need to go you may have to stay in a facility here or there thats the kind of thing that was going on that was luring more and more people and as the border patrolmen multiple told me chris crane has testified about himself that every time somebody in washington talks about amnesty talks about legalizing people that are here it becomes a massive draw a lure to people to come into this country illegally that lures people to their deaths it lures young girls into situations where they end up being sex slaves we are told that the sex trafficking is horrendous and that young girls coming up here are often raped on the way by the gangs bringing them and as one border patrolman had said since he was hispanic and he spoke better spanish than many of the people coming across he would ask them the question they are required to ask about why did you come to america and 90 percent of the time he said they would say to get away from gang violence he would say in spanish hey some gringo may accept that but you and i both know you paid a gang some gang to bring you up here so dont be telling me you came to get away from the gangs you used a gang to get here and 90 percent of the time their responses were well yeah that is true but we were told to say we are getting away from gang violence well the spokesperson for the white house also said about the senate bill it would also have ramped up interior enforcement of immigration laws against dangerous individuals well in juan francisco lopezsanchez case the immigration laws were being enforced to some extent not completely but to some extent he had been to prison a number of times he violated the immigration laws and had illegal reentry been deported five times so at least on five occasions the interior enforcement was happening the issue was that the bureau of prisons released him to a sanctuary city of san francisco and not to ice and san francisco released him then to walk freely so even if we followed the white house advice and ramped up interior enforcement which clearly this administration has no intention whatsoever of doingand i have stories to back that up shortlythen it would not have changed in all likelihood the outcome of that case for those who are tempted to say you are making a big deal about one case where a sweet young daughter was shot dead by somebody deported five times a criminal a felon multipletime felon but it is not that big a deal well it is a big deal just recently we had an article the 7th of july of this year written by caroline may headline illegal immigrants accounted for nearly 37 percent of federal sentences in fy 2014 according to fiscal year 2014 ussc data of 74 911 sentencing cases citizens accounted for 43 479 or 58 percent illegal immigrants accounted for 27 505 or 36 7 percent and legal immigrants made up for 4 percent of those sentences as far as drug trafficking illegal immigrants represented 16 8 percent of all drug trafficking cases they represented 20 percent of the kidnapping and hostage taking cases they represented 74 1 percent of the drug possession cases 12 3 percent of money laundering cases and 12 percent of murder convictions of the federal murder convictions in america 12 percent would not have happened since this president has taken office there are thousands of people who would not have been murdered if we enforced our immigration laws and had a secure border it is not just this precious girl in san francisco it is not a race issue there are hispanics being killed there are hispanics being taken hostage there are hispanics being raped there are whites blacks asiansyou name it they are victims of illegal immigrant criminal activity it is absolutely outrageous for anyone in a government position to belittle thousands of people being murdered raped kidnapped and to be so cavalier about it the white house says well the bill that they were plugging for would have enhanced penalties for repeat immigration violators with sentences up to 20 years for certain illegal aliens who were convicted of felonies look there were laws in place and they were violated he had been to prison until you secure the border people like mr lopezsanchez are going to keep coming back you have to secure the border he also said the bill would have increased penalties for passport and immigration document trafficking and fraud yes like that would have stopped him he came back across illegally five times it wasnt a passport issue it is just pretty dramatic what kind of things have occurred i also filed a bill todaywe have got some cosponsorsregarding the district of columbia the district of columbia by authority of the constitution was empowered to congress we set up local control some would say well wait a minute if you are trying to punish a sanctuary city like the district of columbia the only real federal city in the country the only real city under congressional constitutional control why dont you just leave it to the locals we did and the local officials allowed it to become a sanctuary city that was not enforcing the law so the bill that was passed today wasnt near as tough as i felt like it should have been it wasnt near as tough of a bill as the king amendment had been that we had previously passed with plenty of votes we could have passed it again today but that is not the bill that was brought it is a good first step it is a step in the right direction that is why i ended up voting for it even though it was not as strong as the original king amendment it is important to avoid having sanctuaries refuges for people who are felons like the man who killed kate steinle then we have this story from july 22 by elizabeth harrington it points out that the obama administration is not only planning on not enforcing the law despite all the hogwash coming out of the white house press room and not only are they not going to enforce the law but here is what is coming out the article points out the obama administration is moving forward with plans to expand a waiver program that will allow additional illegal aliens to remain in the country rather than apply for legal status from abroad the department of homeland security issued a proposed rule on tuesday that would make changes to a waiver program created by president barack obamas executive action on immigration in 2013 unconstitutional as it was the action created a waiver that primarily allowed illegal immigrants with a unitedstates citizen spouse or parent to stay and it goes into the specifics the new rule expands eligibility to a host of other categories of illegal immigrants jessica vaughan director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies said its a very bad policy it makes it possible for illegal aliens to avoid the consequences established by congress to deter people from settling here illegally and then laundering their status by adjusting to a green card vaughan who has been following the issue for over 2 years said the changes to the waiver program would increase fraud it is a slap in the face to the many legal immigrants who abide by the law follow the process and wait their turn she said in addition it will increase the likelihood of fraud in the marriage categories which produce tens of thousands of new green cards each year the president should not be issuing executive actions that serve only to expedite the legalization process for those who have ignored our laws this legalization gimmick is undermining the integrity of our legal immigration system and congress should take steps to block it the public will have 60 days to comment on the proposal it appears to be yet another unconstitutional act by our president still seeming to thumb his nose at the judge in south texas who had put an injunction on the last amnesty that was issued by the president so they are just going to keep going apparently this article by julia preston has a title from the new york times most undocumented immigrants will stay under obamas new policies report says under new immigration enforcement programs the obama administration is putting in place across the country the vast majority of unauthorized immigrantsup to 87 percentwould not be the focus of deportation operations and would have a degree of protection to remain in the united states according to a report published thursday by the migration policy institute the report found that about 13 percent of an estimated 11 million immigrants without papers or about 1 4 million people have criminal records or recently crossed the border illegally making them priorities for deportation under guidelines the administration announced in november it makes it very clear that there is so much disingenuousness coming out of the white house oh yes if we had passed this ridiculous bill that the senate passed which really was not going to address the issue of enforcement adequately we were going to have studies and plans if it did not work in 5 years heck we would let the secretary give us a report on why it didnt all work i mean it is absurd secure the border it is very basic the president has got the power and he has got the money heck they just blew off the 4 billion virtual fence a few years ago that we had appropriated money for what are they doing with that money why havent they secured the border with that they could do it just when you think news

nuclear deal with world powers that was welcomed by authorities in tehran the devastating revelation from mitch ginsburg and the times of israel reads mojtaba atarodi arrested in california for attempting to acquire equipment for irans militarynuclear programs was released in april as part of back channel talks times of israel told the contacts mediated in oman for years by close colleagues of the sultan have seen a series of unitedstates iran prisoner releases not exchanges but releases and there may be more to come i mean it is incredible we are told we have seen the deal oh yes there are parts like the iaea has got to work out its side deal that we dont see here in congress but it is a good deal lets not forget my friend who spoke last from the other side of the aisle was talking about how great the doddfrank bill is let me just say this quickly about that as for the doddfrank bill that was passed supposedly to punish those evil investment banks on wall street what has it really done it has punished the community banks that didnt do anything wrong they werent invested in mortgagebacked securities they werent doing all kinds of machinations to try to create new forms of legalized gambling on wall street they werent engaged in that yet doddfrank has so punished community banks that every month there are fewer community banks they are getting gobbled up by the guys who caused the problems that is what doddfrank did it added so much expense and burden on the local banks and it provided a lot of benefits to the biggest banks they are the ones that could absorb the parts of the law we are losing banks constantly as far as the great economic news we know we have at least 93plus million people for the first time in our history94 million people maybe nowwho have given up looking for jobs it has never gotten that high before it had gotten close once before i think under carter but it has never gotten this high before people have just given up looking for jobs you have got more on food stamps than ever before is that really something to be proud of it is if you want indentured servitude of the people of the united states the middle class we hear now recently is growing smaller the gap between the ultra rich and the poor is growing bigger under this presidents redistribution model because it doesnt work the most troubling economic statistic that anybody should have been seeing over the last few yearsover the last 2 yearscame out in 2013 that under president obama for the first time in american historyever95 percent of all of the income went to the top 1 percent income earners it still bothers me greatly but i read actually that even though the top 1 percent is making 95 percent of all the income it was a slower growth to them than in the last two expansions so it really was not that great of news for them well it isnt great for america when 95 percent of the income is made by the top 1 percent it is just this wink and nod with wall street from this administration of we are going to call you fat cats we are going to punish you we are going to hit you with doddfrank and what happens you kill the smaller banks you hurt the middle class you overburden the middle class you make it more difficult for them to live more people end up on food stamps it is a disaster that is why it was no surprise in the last couple of days when we saw a report that there is a great majority of americans who feels like this president has hurt the economy more than he has helped it i dont know that that is true but i do know that more people according to the poll are saying that capital markets and wall street oh they have done well yes that is what happens when we create more money than at any time in american history we are creating money notice i am saying creating money because i learned it was improper to say we are printing more money than ever before i was told by someone with the fedsome years back when i asked how much more money are we printing than we have ever printed oh none really but there is more money in the system oh yes we couldnt possibly print all of the money we are creating are you kidding me we are just adding numbers we arent even bothering to print it anymore as we are increasing money so fast it is an outrage what has happened the bottom line is americans are suffering government does not make things better it is better when they get a job not more food stamps it is time that we knock doddfrank down to size where it does deal with the investment banks that caused the problem of 2008 and doesnt punish the banks that didnt get us in that trouble in the time i have left i have just got to go back to this horrendous iranian deal it is putting the united states and all freedomloving people at risk iran cannot be trusted and i am still concerned about the language like if you say in a bill or in the iran agreement oh yes you cant use icbms or develop them for 8 years or at the broader conclusion of the iaeas that nuclear material is being used for peaceful purposes whichever is earlier that concerns me about the 8year requirement is it really an 8year requirement seriously i mean what does that mean i went down and cleared that that was not classified so i could speak of that there are a few places where i have seen that that language the broader conclusion by the iaea holy cow that is completely out of our control that is one of the time deadlines that some of the important timing can be iran continues to make clear as this story from july 12 from adam kredo says that iran is saying we will trample upon america iranian cleric ayatollah mohammad ali movahedi kermani who was handpicked by the islamic republics supreme leader to deliver the prayers delivered a message of hostility toward the united states in the first official remarks since a final nuclear deal was signed between iran and world powers in vienna last week analysts who spoke to the washington free beacon about the antiamerican tone of last weeks prayers said it is a sign tehran believes it bested the united states in the talks you think the article further down says irans defense minister on monday said the deal also will prohibit all foreigners from inspecting irans defensive and missile capabilities at sensitive military sites you dont have to have my sat scores to know they are going to be classifying as many sites as they can as defensive sites that we cannot have inspected it is time to say no to the deal americans need to rise up and demand it and lets crush the iranian deal before iran crushes israel and the great satan united states i yield back the balance of my time"]], "top_unsure": [[0.5, 0.0, 0, "10 days ago congress expected the president to submit his plan

dumped in this estuary that they talk about this environment they are trying to protect when you think about that much sewage being dumped into the delta on a daily basis you hear the same people talking about trying to protect it there are things going on in that delta and they have been restricting our water for the last 20 years and it has not saved that species there are provisions in these bills that actually help we attacked the invasive species that is attacking the delta smelt the striped bass we have offered that provision many times we are offering many solutions like the author mentioned earlier we have had language in probably five different pieces of legislation going through the house over to the senate we have begged for an open and transparent process where we can debate this and have some commonsense ideas brought forward and voted and signed into law so that we can help both our communities if you truly care about the delta stop polluting it if you truly care about the people of california and what it costs to feed your families if you truly care about farm workers if you truly care about these small communities you would care about water and doing this right and having an honest debate now i have been approached off camera a million times now to have another offcamera conversation about this and we have said all along no more conversation like that everything on the floor this is an open transparent process five pieces of legislation have this language in it and we are going to continue to push until we can get some support so we can fix this problem so those little communities in my district that people claim to care about could actually turn on a faucet and fill a pot of water so they can make themselves some food to eat and some dinner maybe bathe their children because that is where we are today we have houses that when they turn on a faucet they no longer have water and i get the whole junior water rights concern but if they were truly concerned about the environment they would give up some of their water but you look at hetch hetchy that has had 100 percent of their water and continues to deliver that water via pipeline all the way to san francisco without one conversation about that water being able to help some of these rivers and some of these species but they are not willing to give up any of their water they are willing to take other peoples water it is the same thing we hear about on so many different issues take someone elses product or someone elses water and try to solve another problem with it and the problem has to be solved the right way language that we have offered that has been offered into these amendments into these bills and that we have pushed over to the senate and the conversation has to be had in an open transparent process like our senators have told us they wanted so we are here we are ready for that conversation we want an honest debate and we want to talk about the way we actually fix these problems we are not going to try to accommodate communities dumping their sewage in the delta but we want to help those species and there is language in there to do that even language in there to help capture some of the water use some of the infrastructure we have paid for as taxpayers and allow it to be used to its full capacity so we can continue to store water that we do have and not waste it this is an honest piece of language that could actually help solve californias problems and i think we need to continue to have an honest debate"], [0.5, 0.0, 0,

to get to know some of them in recent years they are part of an international diaspora of 5 million people who fled iran after it fell to islamic fascism 36 years ago the stories they tell are bloodcurdling one woman told of her cousin who had been rounded up in an antigovernment demonstration and taken to prison after several years the families were informed that their loved ones were to be released in the town square when the excited families arrived for their longawaited reunion their sons were hanged before their eyes a doctor told me of his college days in paris he called home to tell his brother in tehran of an antikhomeini demonstration his brother was promptly arrested tortured and imprisoned for simply listening now a few months ago after many years of silence the brother in america received a call from his brother in iran who wanted to tell him of the simmering unrest going on throughout that country the american brother told him to shut up to remember what happened the last time they had spoken so candidly his brother in tehran said i dont care anymore they cant arrest all of us all of the iranian expatriates i spoke with tell me the same thing the economic sanctions and international isolation of the regime were bringing iran to the brink of revolution and this brings us to the presidents negotiation with irans fascist islamic regime any agreement between irans leaders and the united states is meaningless because irans leaders word is meaningless irans government is a notoriously untrustworthy rogue state that has made it unmistakably clear that it intends to acquire nuclear weapons and once acquired to use them the only way to avert this nightmare short of war is for the regime to collapse from within over the last several years the iranian opposition has grown dramatically for two reasons there is a strong and growing perception among the iranian people that the iranian dictatorship is a pariah in the international community and the resulting international economic sanctions have created conditions that make the regimes overthrow imperative at precisely this moment in history barack obama did incalculable damage by initiating these negotiations by engaging this rogue state president obama has given it international recognition and legitimacy at just that moment when it had lost legitimacy in the eyes of its own people worse by promising relief from economic sanctions he has removed the most compelling reason the organized iranian resistance had to justify the regimes overthrow it is not the outcome of the negotiations that matters because any agreement with irans conniving leaders is meaningless it is the negotiations themselves that have greatly strengthened the regime just when it was most vulnerable from growing opposition among its own people now the house just passed h r 1191 that purports to restore congressional oversight to these talks i believe it completely missed the point first our constitution requires that any treaty be approved by twothirds of the senate well that wasnt going to happen so mr obama simply redefined the prospective treaty as an agreement between leaders an agreement with no force of law and no legal standing i fear the congress has just changed this equation by establishing a wholly extraconstitutional process that lends the imprimatur of congress to these negotiations with no practical way to stop the lifting of sanctions instead of twothirds of the senate having to approve a treaty as the constitution requires this agreement takes effect automatically unless twothirds of both houses reject ita complete sham but worse i fear this bill gives tacit approval to extremely harmful negotiations that congress instead ought to vigorously condemn and unambiguously repudiate we can only hope that in the days ahead what churchill called the parliamentary democracies will regain the national leadership required to prevent these negotiations from producing what amounts to the munich accords for the middle east that will require treating the iranian dictatorship as the international pariah that it is and it will require
